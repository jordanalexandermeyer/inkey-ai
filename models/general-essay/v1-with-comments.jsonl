{"prompt": "Many parents give children a weekly or monthly allowance regardless of their behavior because they believe an allowance teaches children to be financially responsible. Other parents only give children an allowance as a reward for completing chores or when they have behaved properly. Explain what you think parents should do and why.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Starting when I was about eight years old, my parents gave me a list of chores that had to be completed each week. If I did my chores, I got an allowance, a bit of change that I could use as I pleased. If I didn’t do my chores, I didn’t get my allowance. There was no other punishment, but no other punishment was necessary. That dollar or two a week was all the incentive I needed to help out around the house. Whether it was the latest Barbie or a six-pack of Hubba Bubba chewing gum, there was always something I wanted to buy. My parents could always count on me doing my chores.\n\nI think that giving children an allowance for doing chores is a smart parenting move, for it accomplishes four important goals: It helps ensure that important work gets done around the house; it teaches children that they need to do their part to make things run smoothly for the whole family; it rewards children in a realistic, practical way for good behavior; and it helps teach children how to handle money\n\nI know that some people consider money for chores a form of bribery, and others feel that children should just do their chores anyway, without the incentive of an allowance. They argue that giving kids money for doing chores undermines the lesson that they need to help the family and do their part. I can understand that point of view, and when parents give their children too much money, it does undermine those lessons. But when the allowance is small, it is simply a modern version of the age-old practice of rewarding good behavior. Once children reach a certain age, money is an appropriate and effective reward that helps them learn how to be responsible and how to manage money. They get a sense of what things are worth and how much they have to save and spend to get what they want. And learning to save in order to purchase a desired item teaches them patience and helps children better understand the value of hard work.\n\nGiving children money for doing chores is also a good introduction to the reality of the workplace. If they do the work, they get paid; if they don’t do the work, they don’t. Extra work can be rewarded with bonuses and extra praise; poor work may result in a pay cut or demotion.\n\nIt’s important for parents to find the right amount to give. Too much money may make a child feel like hired help and will undermine the goal of teaching children to help simply because they are part of a family that must work together. On the other hand, too little money may make a child feel resentful, as if his or her work isn’t worth anything to the household. What’s an appropriate amount? It depends upon the amount of chores the child is expected to do and the child’s age. If your nine-year-old is only expected to clean his or her room, a dollar a week is probably plenty. If your fourteenyear-old is expected to keep his room clean, take out the trash, water the plants, and vacuum the house, then ten dollars a week is more appropriate.\n\nBeing paid for my chores helped me have a good attitude about housework, taught me how to save money and spend it wisely, and enabled me to appreciate the hard work my parents did around the house. I’m really grateful that this was the way my parents chose to handle chores in our household.###"}
{"prompt": "More and more farmers and food manufacturers are genetically modifying their crops to reduce susceptibility to disease, improve flavor, and reduce costs. Do you think genetically modifying foods is a good idea? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A few decades ago, manipulating genes in people, plants, and animals was just science fiction. Today, it’s a reality, and genetic modification may have many positive applications in the future, including the eradication of many hereditary diseases. But like most scientific and technological advances, the genetic modification of organisms for our food supply can be as dangerous as it is beneficial. Because of the potential dangers of this technology, I think genetically altering plants and animals in the food supply is a practice that should be very tightly controlled and carefully studied before it is an accepted and common practice. Unfortunately, it may already be too late for that.\n\nMany people don’t even realize that many of their foods are genetically modified organisms (GMOs). GMOs are already prevalent in supermarkets and grocery stores across the country, but manufacturers are not required to label foods as having been made from GMOs. As a result, millions of Americans purchase and eat GMOs every day without even knowing it. Yet we don’t even know if GMOs are harmful to our health. We don’t really know how GMOs may affect our bodies or our ecosystem. When we mess with DNA, we may be making changes that have all sorts of dangerous repercussions, including some that we may not even realize for several generations.\n\nOne of the main concerns about GMOs is the unpredictability of the behavior of altered genes and of the bacteria, plants, and animals that interact with the altered organism. For example, a crop of corn genetically modified to be less susceptible to a particular insect may take on other unwanted characteristics due to the change. It may, for example, become more susceptible to another disease, or it could develop a tougher skin on its kernels, or it could decrease the crop’s ability to produce vitamin E.\n\nMore frightening is the domino effect of genetically modifying foods. Any change in an organism’s DNA has the potential to affect not only the organism but also anything that feeds off of it, including us. How do we know how GMOs might affect us on a microscopic, genetic level? We don’t know, and can’t know, without years of studies that track all sorts of potential outcomes over several generations.\n\nAnother fear is that transferred genes may escape from one organism into another. For example, imagine that Strain A of sweet peas was altered by adding a gene that would increase its sugar production. Through cross-pollination, this altered genetic code could enter other strains and slowly (or quickly) infect the entire sub-species. If the alteration was beneficial, this could be a good thing. But the altered gene might not act the same way in all varieties, and the change may not be a good thing in the first place, and/or it may have unintended consequences.\n\nGenetically modifying foods is a practice that has been driven by the desire to make more food available more quickly and more cheaply than ever before. This attitude puts profit first and consumers and the environment last, and that is simply dangerous. The agribusiness needs to slow down and stop selling us GMOs until their safety is certain.###"}
{"prompt": "A few decades ago, many families had half a dozen or more children. Nowadays, more and more families are choosing to have only one or two children. Are smaller families better than larger ones? Why or why not? State your position and support it with specific reasons and examples.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I grew up in a large family—I am the oldest of six—and I have many wonderful memories from my childhood. I am very close to most of my siblings and I treasure my relationships with them. But when I have my own family someday, it won’t be as big as the one I grew up in. As much as my large family was full of love, and as much as I learned about sharing, giving, and patience, I think having too many kids puts too much pressure on the parents and the oldest children.\n\nWhen I think back on my childhood, I remember playing with my siblings or grandparents. I don’t remember spending a whole lot of time with my mother and father. They were always around, but they were always busy. Although they did their best to spend some quality time with each of us, there was just too much to do to keep our large family going. My mother was always cooking, cleaning, nursing, changing a diaper, shopping, or taking someone to baseball practice or a playdate. She was always tired.\n\nMy father, on the other hand, was always working. He needed overtime whenever he could get it, and weekends were always full of projects around the house. He had lots of helpers, of course, but there are only so many things kids can do. Even when we were able to get away for vacation, Mom and Dad couldn’t really relax, because there were so many kids to look after.\n\nMoney was also a constant worry for my family. With so many children, our budget was always tight. Back-to-school shopping was always a stressful time; we all wanted the latest fashions, but we could only get a few things. My younger siblings lived on hand-me-downs as much as they could. We shopped at bargain stores and often got clothes that we didn’t really like because they were on sale. Our house always needed repairs, and there was never enough money to keep up.\n\nAnother problem with large families is that the older siblings always end up being babysitters. Like it or not (and most of the time I didn’t like it), I had to watch my younger brothers and sisters. At age six, I could change a diaper like a pro. I was getting my brothers and sisters dressed, giving them breakfast, helping them get ready for bed. I learned a lot about sharing, selfsacrifice, and responsibility at an early age, and these are important character traits that I value highly and want to instill in my children. But I also want to give them a chance to be children. I don’t want them to have so much responsibility at such an early age.\n\nI don’t want to give the impression that I didn’t have a happy childhood. I most definitely did; I was loved as much as my parents could love me, and I had wonderful fun with my brothers and sisters. But I always wanted a little more time with Mom and Dad, and I often resented having so much responsibility. I wished my mom wasn’t always so tired and my dad didn’t have to work so much. Because I want to be there more for my kids, because I want them to be kids throughout their childhood, I plan to have a much smaller family.###"}
{"prompt": "Good habits improve our physical, emotional, and/or financial health. Select one of your good habits and write an essay persuading readers to make that habit a part of their lives.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When I was fifteen, I wanted to get a job so I could buy a car when I turned sixteen. My father sat me down at the kitchen table and said, “Excellent. But only on one condition: 10% of every paycheck must go into a savings account. And you cannot touch that money except in an emergency.”\n\n“But Dad,” I argued, “If I have to put 10% away, how will I ever save enough money to buy a car?”\n\n“You’ll have enough,” he replied. “And you’ll soon see how important it is to set money aside for savings.”\n\nI didn’t believe him at the time, and in fact I often resented having to put that 10% in a separate account. But two years later when the transmission on my car blew, I didn’t have to fret about coming up with the money for repairs. I was able to cover the cost easily and was back on the road in no time. It was then that I began to see the wisdom of my father’s rule, which I adopted as my own. This habit has helped to give me a secure financial life, and I urge you to make this practice part of your life.\n\nTen percent of each paycheck may sound like a lot, and if you’re on a tight budget to begin with, you might be thinking, “I just can’t afford to do it.” In truth, you can’t afford not to do it. You never know when you are going to need an extra $100 or $1,000; life is full of surprises, and lots of them are expensive. You can afford to do this.\n\nIn fact, you can’t afford not to do this. As tight as your budget may be, it’s important to get started right away. If you are absolutely scraping by with every last penny going to bills, then start with just 5%, but move up to 10% as soon as you can. If you earn $500 a week, for example, put $25–$50 in your savings account each week. At first, this may mean clipping coupons, renting a movie instead of going to the theater, or pressing your own shirts instead of taking them to the cleaner. Think carefully about ways you can save just a few dollars—because just a few dollars from each paycheck is all it takes to build up a solid savings account.\n\nThe money you save will add up quickly. For example, if your annual salary is $40,000, each year, you would put $4,000 into your savings account. That still leaves you with $36,000 to cover all of your expenses. After ten years, you will have saved $40,000, plus interest. And the more money in your account, the more interest you earn, the larger your emergency fund, the more you can afford to relax later in your life.\n\nOnce you get in the habit of putting 10% of your money into savings, it won’t feel like a sacrifice. The 90% that’s left will be your working budget, and you won’t even miss that 10% because you won’t be used to spending it. Yet you will know that it is there, ready for an emergency, helping to keep you financially secure. So take my father’s advice, and mine: Put a piece of each paycheck into your savings. It’s a habit that’s worth every penny.###"}
{"prompt": "Is there a book that you feel should be required reading for everyone? Write an essay persuading your audience to read this book.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Most people know who Frankenstein is—or at least they think they do. Because of the way Mary Shelley’s brilliant 1818 novel has been adapted to film, most Americans think that Frankenstein is a towering, scar-faced monster who brings terror wherever he goes. In Shelley’s novel, however, the real monster is Victor Frankenstein, the scientist who is the monster’s creator. In her story of how Victor Frankenstein creates the monster and what he does after the monster comes to life, Shelley conveys several timeless messages about the dangers of science, the dangers of isolation, and the importance of being a good parent. It is a novel that everyone should read.\n\nIn the story, Frankenstein, eager for glory, wants to discover the “elixir of life” so that he can have the power to bring the dead back to life. He wants to create a new race of superhuman beings and wants them to worship him like a god. He wants to unlock the secrets of nature and use that power for his own selfish goals. Shelley’s novel warns us that we must be careful what we do with science—how we apply the knowledge we discover. For when Frankenstein does discover the “elixir of life,” and when he does create a superhuman being, he creates a creature that is beyond his control. The creature is more powerful and more intelligent than Victor Frankenstein, and the creature engineers Frankenstein’s demise.\n\nShelley’s novel also warns us about the dangers of isolation. Frankenstein’s creation is so revolting and dangerous in part because Frankenstein works completely alone. He becomes so absorbed with his project that he completely blocks out family and friends. He stops communicating with others and works secretly; he does not consult others about his project, partly because he knows that what he is doing is wrong, partly because he wants all the glory. But because he does not work with others, because he loses touch with his community of family and friends, he also loses touch with his responsibility to other human beings. When the creature comes to life, Frankenstein runs away, abandoning his creation even though he knows the creature might harm others.\n\nThis abandonment brings us to the novel’s third timeless message: the importance of being a good parent. Frankenstein creates a living being and then abandons him because he is an “ugly wretch.” He totally ignores his responsibility to the creature, who is born as innocent as a child, even though he is the size of a giant. The creature is abhorred by everyone he meets, and because no one has ever shown him love, he learns to hate. And the person he comes to hate most is the father who abandoned him. Shelley’s message is clear: you are responsible for what you create, and if you are a parent, you must love your child, whatever his or her appearance.\n\nIn our age of cloning and genetic engineering, of scattered communities and neighbors who don’t know each other’s names, of abandoned children and abusive parents, Shelley’s book may have more importance than ever. It is also a powerful and suspense-filled tale. Will Frankenstein capture the creature? Will he create a “bride” for the monster? Will Walton, the ship captain who records Frankenstein’s story, learn from Frankenstein’s tale? Find out for yourself. Grab a copy of this amazing novel and enjoy.###"}

Do you spend hours and hours there each day, surrounded by bags of chips and cans of soda? Do you panic when you can’t find the remote control and think that you might actually have to get up off of the sofa to change the channel?\n\nIf you answered “yes” to any of these questions, you are not alone. In fact, you are one of the millions of Americans who are “couch potatoes”: people who spend their days and nights “vegging out” in front of the “tube.” Well, spud, it’s time to get up out of that armchair and get some exercise!\n\nI know how seductive television can be. I know how easy it is to plop onto the sofa and lose yourself in the world of sports, reality shows, and goodold make-believe. I know how mesmerizing MTV and other channels can be and how hard it can be to pull yourself away. But all that television spells disaster for your body because it needs to be active to be healthy. And it’s no good for your mental health or social life, either.\n\nThink about what all that time in front of the television is doing to your body. Think about what all that sagging muscle and growing belly is doing to your life. Think about how your lack of energy affects you at work.\n\nNow think about how different things would be if you spent some of that TV time getting exercise instead: You would feel better during the day.

{"prompt": "Nowadays, the private life of a politician is hardly private. In your opinion, should we be so concerned with the private affairs of a politician or political candidate? State your position and support it with specific reasons and examples.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When you think of former president Bill Clinton, what’s the first thing that comes to mind? Unfortunately, for many people, the first thing they think of is Monica Lewinsky. Like millions of people around the globe, I was horrified by how much the investigation delved into Mr. Clinton’s private affairs. No one needed to know the sort of details that were revealed by Ken Starr’s investigation. But while I don’t want to know the details, I do believe we have a right to know what sort of lives our politicians are living. I believe their behavior in private is a reflection of their true values and how they will behave in office.\n\nFor example, if a politician lies to his or her spouse (I’m talking about big lies, like infidelity, not little white lies), that tells us something about his or her character. In my opinion, this person is not to be trusted. I wouldn’t have faith that this politician would keep his or her word. True, the relationship between a husband and wife is very different from that between a politician and his or her constituents. But the politician’s respect for that relationship and how he or she deals with any problems in that relationship reflects his or her level of integrity.\n\nSimilarly, if a politician (or political candidate) behaves in an illegal manner, that shows a disrespect for the law. A government official who employs an illegal resident as a nanny or housekeeper, for example, or pays a nanny or housekeeper under the table to avoid taxes is acting as if he or she is above the law—or demonstrating that he or she simply doesn’t care about the law. This is not the kind of person I want in a public office.\n\nOn the other hand, if a politician leads a respectable, law-abiding life at home, we can expect a respectable, law-abiding performance in office. A politician who deals honestly with family, friends, and business associates is likely to deal honestly with his or her constituents as well. A politician who respects the law in all aspects of his or her private life is likely to respect the law while in office, too. A candidate who behaves in a cautious, reserved manner regarding his or her personal affairs is likely to bring a similar approach to the office.\n\nI know that nobody is perfect and that every politician may have skeletons in the closet. I’m not talking about transgressions from the distant past. But I am concerned with a politician’s recent past and current behavior. Is he or she honest or does he or she break promises? Does he or she behave recklessly or in a thoughtful and controlled manner? We cannot separate who we are personally from who we are professionally. That is why I believe the public has a right to know.###"}

That’s more than most people make in a year; indeed, it’s more than some people earn in a lifetime. Yes, Michael Jordan was a phenomenal basketball player. Yes, he was also a fantastic role model. But no, he did not deserve to earn such a ridiculously high salary. Jordan, like many other top professional athletes, was grossly overpaid.\n\nWhy do top athletes earn such inflated salaries? Because they bring big bucks into their cities and franchises. But what sort of service do they provide to society? Do they save lives? No. Do they improve the standard of living or promote positive social change? No. Do they help keep our streets safe or educate our kids? No. True, many of the top athletes are good role models for our children. But seven-figure salaries don’t always mean model behavior. Take N.B.A. star Latrell Spreewell, for example, who choked and threatened to kill his coach.\n\nIt is true that professional athletes work hard, and many have spent their lives pursuing their goals. It is also true that most professional athletes have a relatively short career span—a decade perhaps at the top of their game. Limited as their professional sporting career may be, they don’t deserve such high salaries. After their professional sports careers are over, they can certainly pursue other careers and work “regular” jobs like the rest of us. Ending their stint as professional athletes doesn’t mean they have to stop earning incomes. They just have to earn incomes in a different way. Why should they be any different from the rest of us who may need to switch careers?\n\nIt is also true that professional athletes may be injured while on the job; their work is indeed physical, and especially in contact sports like football, injuries are bound to happen. But, like the rest of us, they have insurance, and in nearly all cases, their exorbitant salaries more than cover their medical costs. And theirs is not the only high-risk job. What about miners, construction workers, or firefighters? They are at risk for physical injury every day, too—injuries that could likewise end their careers. But they sure aren’t earning millions of dollars a year.\n\nIt is also true that professional athletes may spend years and years practicing with farm teams for a fraction of the salary they receive once they make it to the top. But in every career path, we start off with lower wages and must pay our dues and work our way up. Besides, farm team salaries are not always so low.\n\nWe’re a sports-crazy country, a nation of fanatic sports fans and celebrity worshippers. We’re awed and entertained by the best of them—the Michael Jordans, the Alex Rodriguezes, the Emmitt Smiths.

{"prompt": "Is reading fiction a waste of time? Why or why not? Explain your answer using specific reasons and examples to support your position.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Remember the last book that captured your imagination, that transported you to another place and time? Remember a book that made you fall in love with its characters, made you feel their pain and joy? Remember a story that taught you an important lesson, that helped you better understand others, make sense of the human condition? If so, then you can understand why the question, “Is reading fiction a waste of time?” is such a silly question.\n\nFiction, unlike a user manual, a magazine article, or newspaper editorial, probably won’t offer you any practical knowledge that you can put to immediate use. It won’t inform you of current events or give you advice on how to cultivate a better garden. It probably won’t help you decide which candidate to vote for or which product to buy. But that certainly doesn’t mean it’s useless or impractical. Indeed, fiction serves three important functions for human beings: It helps us be more compassionate to others, it helps us better understand ourselves, and it cultivates our imaginations. It can also teach us about history, psychology, even biology and other sciences.\n\nCompassion for others is rooted in understanding and acceptance, and a good story brings us into the inner world of its characters so that we can understand them. In Toni Morrison’s novel The Bluest Eye, for example, Morrison peels away the layers of her characters’ histories piece by piece like an onion until we see into their core and understand what drives them. They may still do awful things to each other, but she shows us why they do the things that they do, and we learn that we shouldn’t judge others until we understand their pasts. Their stories are sad and painful, and we learn to love even the outcast Pecola. In fact, we learn that those outcasts are the ones who need our love the most.\n\nMany stories and novels also help us better understand ourselves. Joseph Conrad’s dark and powerful novel Heart of Darkness helps us see that all of us have a dark side, and that we need to acknowledge this dark side in order to control it. It makes us question just how civilized we are and indeed what it means to be civilized in the first place.\n\nGood fiction also cultivates our imagination, which is more important to us than some might think. Without imagination, we live a sad, empty life. Imagination is central to our emotional health and is a key factor in our level of intelligence. Facts are one thing; but facts can be of no real use unless coupled with imagination. Fiction can help us by keeping our imagination fresh and active. In a story like Franz Kafka’s “Metamorphosis,” for example, we are asked to imagine that Gregor, the main character, wakes up one morning and has turned into a giant bug. Crazy? Perhaps. But once we accept this premise and imagine Gregor as a five-foot long cockroach, we can feel his family’s horror and imagine his agony as he finds himself trapped in his room and abandoned by those he loves.\n\nIs reading fiction a waste of time? That’s like asking if laughing is a waste of time. We don’t need fiction to survive, but we do need it to be kinder, more understanding, and more creative human beings.###"}
{"prompt": "Some people think that school cafeterias should be required to provide low-fat and/or vegetarian lunch options to accommodate the eating habits of all students. Do you agree or disagree? Explain your position and use specific reasons and examples as support.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " It’s a fact: There are students across the United States who are vegetarian and/or health conscious, and school cafeterias should be required to provide low-fat and/or vegetarian lunch options for them. Even more importantly, many teenagers’ dietary decisions are not only based on health concerns but also religious and/or moral issues. In this day and age, an individual's eating habits often reflect his or her identity. For these reasons, it's imperative that each school's cafeteria menu be as diverse as its student body.\n\nJust by reading headlines in any of the major news magazines, it becomes clear that the United States is a nation that needs to slim down. In every town and city, there are an abundance of fast food restaurants that lure teenage customers with fast, inexpensive, and tasty food, but these foods are typically unhealthy. Unfortunately, school cafeterias, in an effort to provide food that is appetizing to young people, mimic fast food menus, often serving items such as burgers and fries, pizza, hot dogs, and fried chicken. While these foods do provide some nutritional value, they are relatively high in fat, and many of them, namely burgers, hot dogs, and fried chicken, are clearly not designed for vegetarians.\n\nMany of the lunch selections currently offered by most school cafeterias could be made vegetarian and/or more healthy with a few simple and inexpensive substitutions. Veggie burgers, for example, offered alongside beef burgers, would give both vegetarians and the health conscious more options. A salad bar woud also serve the dual purpose of providing both vegetarians and low-fat food eaters the opportunity for a satisfying meal. This is not to say that accommodating every desire or food preference is plausible, but students should have the right to be served foods that coincide with their life choices.###"}
{"prompt": "Many people feel that the use of surveillance cameras in public places such as parking lots is a good idea that can help ensure our safety. Others worry that too many cameras violate our right to privacy and give law enforcement officials too much power. In your opinion, should we install more surveillance cameras in public places? Why or why not? Support your position with specific reasons and examples.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Not long ago, the nation was gripped by the horrifying news that a baby had been stolen from a car in a parking lot while her mother, who was returning a shopping cart, was just a few feet away. Thanks to the description of the kidnapper captured by surveillance cameras in the parking lot and broadcast over radios, television, and highway overpass signs, the kidnapper was quickly caught and the baby returned, unharmed, to her mother. Had it not been for those surveillance cameras, that mother would probably never have seen her baby girl again.\n\nI can’t think of a much better argument for the use of surveillance cameras in public places. That baby’s life was saved by those parking lot cameras. Many people worry about the use of surveillance cameras in public places such as parking lots, stores, parks, and roadways. They don’t like the idea that they are being watched. They worry that the information captured on the surveillance tapes can somehow be used against them. But how? It seems to me that the only reason we should worry about being caught on surveillance cameras is if we are doing something wrong. If we are behaving lawfully in a public place, then why worry if it is captured on film?\n\nSurveillance cameras can provide two immensely important services. One, they can help us find those who commit crimes, including thieves, kidnappers, vandalizers, and even murderers. Two, they can serve as a powerful deterrent to crime. A thief who plans to steal a car may think twice if he knows he will be caught on video. A woman who hopes to kidnap a child may abandon her plans if she knows she will be captured on film.\n\nSurveillance cameras can also help us in less critical but nonetheless practical ways. In some towns in England, for example, radio deejays use information from surveillance cameras to announce the availability of parking spaces in crowded public parking lots. Problems of all shapes and sizes can also be noted and addressed through video surveillance. For example, imagine a video camera installed in a local town square. Reviewing the films, officials might realize that people who meet in the square move quickly into the shade of the one tree in the center of the square. This could move officials to plant more trees or provide tables with umbrellas so that people could meet and relax in the shade. Similarly, a video camera in a grocery store might reveal that Isle 7 is always overcrowded, prompting the manager to re-arrange items to more evenly distribute shoppers.\n\nOf course it’s possible to have too much of a good thing, and if surveillance cameras cross the line and start being installed on private property— that is, in our offices and homes—then we will have the “Big Brother is watching” scenario opponents fear. If that were the case, I would be against surveillance cameras, too. But as long as surveillance cameras are limited to public places, they can help ensure our safety.###"}

Alexander Smith said that a great person is someone who does a thing for the first time. He’s right, and the list of those great people is long and includes the likes of Neil Armstrong, Jackie Robinson, and Thomas Edison. But Smith’s definition isn’t broad enough to include many other people who I believe are also great. In my opinion, greatness can also be attained by doing something to improve the lives of others.\n\nMother Teresa is the first person to come to mind under this broadened definition. Mother Teresa, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, dedicated her life to helping the poor, the sick, and the hungry. She left her homeland of Yugoslavia to work with the impoverished people of India, where she selflessly served others for almost 70 years. She became a nun and founded the Missionaries of Charity sisterhood and the House for the Dying. She embraced those that many in society chose to disdain and ignore: the crippled and diseased, the homeless and helpless. She gave them food, shelter, medical care, and the compassion that so many others denied them. She was certainly not the first to dedicate her life to the care of others, but she was certainly a great woman.\n\nAnother great person who also won a Nobel Peace Prize was Dr. Albert Schweitzer, a German doctor who, like Mother Teresa, also selflessly served the poor and sick. Schweitzer dedicated himself to the people of Africa. There, he built a hospital and a leper colony, a refuge for those who had been rejected by society. Again, he was not the first to offer care and comfort for the sick and suffering. But he certainly was great.\n\nHarriet Tubman is also clearly a great woman. She led hundreds of American slaves to freedom along the underground railroad, risking her life over and over again to bring her fellow slaves to freedom. She gave them the greatest gift one can offer: freedom to live a better way of life. She wasn’t the first to escape, and she wasn’t the first to go back for others. But she was the one who kept going back. She knew that each time she returned for another, she was risking her life. But like Mother Teresa and Dr. Schweitzer, Harriet Tubman was utterly dedicated to improving the life of others.\n\nGreatness comes in many forms, and we are lucky to have many examples of greatness upon which to model our lives. Some great people are those who were able to be the first to accomplish something marvelous. Others, like Mother Teresa, Albert Schweitzer, and Harriet Tubman, are great because they worked tirelessly to ease the suffering of their fellow human beings.###"}
{"prompt": "Should people lease or buy new cars? Make a case for the option that you think is best. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Planning to lease a car because you don’t think you can afford to buy? Think again. Leasing can end up being just as expensive as buying—and you don’t even get to keep the car. Even if you decide to buy the car at the end of your lease, you may end up paying considerably more money than if you’d decided to buy from the beginning.\n\nMost people who are thinking about leasing are attracted to this option because they believe it will cost them less money. And they’re right—it is cheaper, but only in the short term. For example, if you were to lease a 2002 Subaru Forester, with $2,500 down, you might pay $250 per month for the car. If you were to buy the same car, with $2,500 down, you would pay closer to $350 per month. Over a three-year lease, that’s $3,600—a big savings. But after your lease is over, you have to give the car back. If you want to keep driving, you’ll either have to put another down-payment on another lease, or, if you have the option to buy the car, you’ll have to pay thousands of dollars to purchase the vehicle—dollars that won’t be spread out in more manageable monthly payments.\n\nMany people want to lease because they can then drive a nicer car than they might otherwise be able to afford. For example, if your monthly budget allowed you to spend $250 on your car, you might be able to lease a brand new Ford Explorer. For the same price, you might have to buy an Explorer that was two or three years old with 50,000 miles, or buy a new but considerably less expensive make and model. A lease therefore allows you to drive in the latest models of more expensive cars. But when your lease is over, you will have to return that Explorer. Whatever car you can afford to buy, you get to keep it, and it will always have a resell or trade-in value if you wanted to later upgrade to a newer car.\n\nFurthermore, people who lease cars are often shocked by how much they must pay when the lease is over. Most leases limit you to a certain number of miles, and if you go over that allotment, you must pay for each mile. As a result, at the end of your lease, you may end up paying thousands of dollars in mileage fees. For example, if your lease covers you for 25,000 miles over three years, but you drive 40,000, that’s an extra 15,000 miles. At $.11 per mile, that’s $1,650 you’ll have to pay. And you still won’t have a car.\n\nIn addition, when you lease, you still have to pay for regular maintenance and repairs to the vehicle. Since you must return the car when your lease expires, you are paying to repair someone else’s car. If you own the car, however, you would know that every dollar you spend maintaining or repairing the car is an investment in a real piece of property—your property, not someone else’s.\n\nBy now, the benefits of buying over leasing should be clear. But if you’re still not convinced, remember this fundamental fact: If you lease, when your lease is up, after you’ve made all of your monthly payments, paid for extra mileage, and paid for repairs, you must give the car back. It isn’t yours to keep, no matter how much the lease cost you. Whatever make or model you can afford to buy, it is yours to keep after you make your payments. There’s no giving it back, and that makes all the difference.###"}
{"prompt": "The inventor and statesman Benjamin Franklin said, “Money never made a man happy yet, nor will it. There is nothing in its nature to produce happiness.” Do you agree with this statement? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Benjamin Franklin is one of the greatest figures in American history, and I have a great deal of respect for this incredible inventor, politician, and writer. But I must respectfully disagree with his claim that, “Money never made a man happy yet, nor will it. There is nothing in its nature to produce happiness.” I agree that money in and of itself does not make a person happy; but I believe that money can help provide one thing that is essential to happiness: good health.\n\nWhile money can do nothing to change our genetic makeup and our physiological predisposition to illness and disease, it can give us access to better healthcare throughout our lives. This begins with prenatal care and childhood vaccinations. In impoverished third-world countries, infant mortality rates are three, four, even ten times higher than in the United States, and as many as one in four women still die in childbirth because they do not have access to modern medical care. Sadly, people who are too poor to afford vaccinations and routine healthcare for their children watch helplessly as many of those children succumb to illnesses and diseases that are rarely fatal here in the United States.\n\nMoney also enables us to afford better doctors and see specialists throughout our lives. If your child has difficulty hearing, for example, and you have insurance (which costs money) or cash, you can see a hearing specialist and pay for therapy. If you have migraines that make you miserable, you can see a headache specialist and afford medication and treatment. Having money also means being able to afford preventative measures, such as taking vitamins and getting regular check-ups. It means being able to afford products and services that can enhance our health, such as gym memberships, organic foods, and acupuncture.\n\nAnother important thing money can do is enable us to live in a healthy environment. Many of the world’s poorest people live in dirty, dangerous places—unsanitary slums crawling with diseases and health hazards of all sorts. In a particularly poor area of the Bronx, for example, children had an abnormally high rate of asthma because their families couldn’t afford to move away from the medical waste treatment plant that was poisoning the air.\n\nMoney can also help us be healthy by enabling us to afford proper heating and cooling measures. This includes being able to afford a warm winter coat and the opportunity to cool off at a pool or in the ocean. On a more basic level, it means being able to afford heat in the winter and air conditioning in the summer. During heat waves, victims of heat stroke are often those who are too poor to afford air conditioning in their apartments. In extreme cold, the same is true: people who freeze to death or become gravely ill from the cold are often those who are unable to afford high heating bills.\n\nHaving money may not make people happy, but it sure goes a long way toward keeping them healthy. And as they say, if you haven’t got your health, you haven’t got anything.###"}
{"prompt": "Some states have now made it illegal to drive while talking on a hand-held cellular phone. Do you think this is a good law that should be passed in other states as well? Why or why not? Explain your answer.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " No matter how careful a driver you may be, when you do something else while driving, whether it’s drinking coffee, changing the radio station, looking at a map, or making a call on your cell phone, you endanger yourself and others because you are distracted from your driving. Even a fraction of a second of distraction is enough to cause an accident. While no state can make it illegal to drink coffee or switch stations while driving, all states can, and should, make it illegal to drive while talking on a cellular phone.\n\nIn the past decade, as the popularity of cellular phones has risen, so have the number of accidents caused by people talking on their cell phones. Whether they were dialing a number, listening to a message, or simply in a heated conversation, they were momentarily distracted from the task of driving, and suddenly—crash! Fortunately, many of these accidents have been minor fender-benders. But all too many have been deadly accidents that could have been prevented by a stricter cell-phone use laws.\n\nCell phone proponents may argue that talking on a cell phone is no more dangerous than, for example, having a cup of coffee while on the road or talking to someone in the back seat. But unlike a cup of coffee, which you can put down between sips, you must keep the phone in your hand. That means that you have only one hand on the wheel while you’re driving. That makes cell phones doubly dangerous: not only are you distracted by dialing or by the conversation; you are also driving one-handed, which means you are less in control. If you suddenly need both hands on the wheel to prevent an accident or to keep your car from sliding, the extra second it takes to get your hand back on the wheel can make the difference between an accident and an accident narrowly averted, between a serious injury and a minor one.\n\nCell phones are also dangerous because when you are busy talking, especially if you really have to concentrate on the matter you are discussing, your mind is not fully focused on the road, and this has a significant effect on your reaction time. You will be slower to make important driving decisions such as how soon to brake and when to switch lanes, and you will be less able to respond to situations on the road.\n\nMany people use cell phones to report accidents and emergencies, to let loved ones know they’ll be late, and to stay in touch when they’re out of town. I’m not arguing that you shouldn’t have a cell phone in your car. What I am saying is that you shouldn’t be driving when you’re talking on that phone. Until your state outlaws hand-held cell phones in cars, pull over to the side of the road when you are ready to make a call. It may add a few extra minutes to your commute, but it just might save your life.###"}

{"prompt": "Explain the problems, both personal and societal, that result from obesity.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A single overweight person might not warrant much attention. But a nation whose population is increasingly obese is cause for concern. In the United States, 14% of children and teenagers are categorized as overweight. Why is this a serious problem instead of simply a matter of personal choice? What are the causes of this constantly increasing percentage of obese persons? What is to be done about this, and what organized steps should be taken to solve the problem?\n\nJust as there are ripples from a stone thrown into the water, there are farreaching and unending effects resulting from obesity. From a psychological perspective, most obese persons would prefer not to be overweight. Our society glorifies the ultra-thin, so if you are obese you do not fit in with acceptable modes of appearance. We know that children are often cruel about taunting their heavy classmates. All too often we hear friends say, “I’ve got to lose weight before that trip,” or “before the wedding.” However, there are more objective measures of the negative results of obesity. Type 2 (adult onset) diabetes, an illness with serious consequences, including damage to the heart, damage to the eyes and difficulty in healing infections is attributed to obesity. Public health agencies are dealing with the continual rise in this type of diabetes. Asthma is also on the rise as a result of the obesity epidemic as are sleep disorders such as sleep apnea. Recent research indicates a relationship between some types of cancer and obesity. Society pays the price when citizens are ill, are unable to work, and require constant medical care.\n\nQuestions arise: “What can be done about this?” “Who or what is to blame?” Discussing blame is a delicate problem. There are undoubtedly overweight individuals with inherited tendencies toward diabetes or heart disease, and there is evidence that a hormone that gives people a sense of fullness after eating may be lacking in some obese people. Yet, knowing that they are at risk would suggest that steps be taken to thwart the onset of the physical consequences of obesity.\n\nMost authorities agree that diet is key. The avoidance of foods high in sugars, carbohydrates, and saturated fats is recommended by most physicians as a way to ward off obesity and its dire consequences. But this is difficult in our society where fast food outlets are ubiquitous, where we are bombarded by advertising of unhealthy foods, and where we lead increasingly sedentary lives. Sugar-laden soft drinks are sold in schools and profits from these sales are high. An elementary school in Los Angeles received $50,000 for allowing Coca-Cola to install its vending machines. This company and Pepsico constitute the majority of the school soft drink market, and while they profit from the present sales, they are also building brand loyalty and creating future habitual soft drink consumers.\n\nLack of adequate exercise is a concomitant contributor to the rise in obesity. Children are often playing video games instead of engaging in sports. Adults watch television instead of exercising. People will drive around shopping centers to avoid walking a few extra steps. The quintessential “couch potato” invention has just been invented. Now you can get a universal remote with which, from your comfortable couch, you can not only control your television, but your oven, lights and, presumably, other things which we can only begin to imagine.\n\nSociety suffers when its population is increasingly unhealthy, has rising medical costs, notes absenteeism from work and school, and has social inequalities. This latter result, social inequalities, reflects the assertion recently made by a school administrator that 50% of children in poorer school districts are obese. Experts seem to believe that obesity is a problem that can, with diligence and desire, be eliminated or at least mitigated with two simple changes in lifestyle—eating more healthily and getting more exercise.###"}
{"prompt": "Describe the purposes of the Internet. Include various viewpoints, including that of users and providers.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In today’s world, the first place people turn to when there is a question to be answered, information to be located, or people to be contacted, is often the Internet. Yes, the Internet may have supplanted the traditional encyclopedia as well as a number of other sources of service and information. We can make reservations, plan vacations, play interactive games, learn a language, listen to music or radio programs, read the newspaper, and find out about a medical condition, without coming face to face with another person. There is no limit to the subject matter you can research on the Internet. Just go to a search engine such as Yahoo or Google, type in a few key words or a Web address, and presto, you will probably summon links to more sources than you could have imagined. The Internet allows you to remain at your computer and shop no matter what you wish to purchase. And if you are looking for a bargain or an unusual item, you can go to a popular auction site and either sell or buy.\n\nIf, however, you do wish to speak directly to a person, there are the chat rooms. On practically any given topic, groups of people converse with each other. They may be giving opinions about a perfect travel itinerary, a book, or even a political party. The most prevalent use of the Internet also involves directly writing to a person, and that is the sending of e-mail messages to friends and associates. It is possible to communicate instantly with anyone, anywhere, as long as there is an Internet connection. In a world where people frequently travel, where families do not necessarily live in the same neighborhoods, e-mail is a means of making simple, inexpensive, immediate contact. Not only do we send verbal messages, but also now digital cameras take pictures that can be stored and then instantly transmitted on the Internet.\n\nUnfortunately, there are individuals who subvert the opportunities offered by this technology. They are less than honest, disguise their identity, bilk people in financial scams, and entice unsuspecting people, including children, into giving them personal information. Caveats about these problems are currently being publicized so those Internet users will not be victimized.\n\nOf course, the Internet providers, such as AOL, hope to make a profit, and there is usually a monthly fee for the hookup. To increase the profits, the providers sell advertising, which may pop up on the subscriber’s screen and require the user to stop and respond, either positively or negatively, to the ads.\n\nWhen you consider that, among other things, you can hear a concert, read a book, visit a museum and view its contents, visit the websites of numerous individuals and organizations, play a game with one or more people, and pay your bills, you will realize that the uses of the Internet are too vast for a short list. Most would agree that much has been added to peoples’ lives by connecting them to the Internet, and that we probably cannot anticipate what new purposes will be explored in the future.###"}
{"prompt": "Describe various styles of shoes as well as reasons for their popularity.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " ###"}
{"prompt": "Visit the shoe department of a large department store and you will undoubtedly see a variety of shoe styles on display. This suggests that the store is satisfying the customers’ desire for an assortment of shoes.\n\nLogically, shoes should protect and support the feet. An example of such a shoe is the sneaker. Originally an inexpensive canvas, rubber soled version of a leather oxford (a shoe with laces), the sneaker has become increasing popular and has supplanted the oxford for regular everyday use for many students and some adults. Sneakers, like living things, have evolved and branched out. They are now mostly made of leather and have much cushioning to minimize stress on the wearer’s joints. They have become specialized into separate sneakers for walking, running, tennis, and basketball. There are sneakers for aerobic classes, and for the eclectic exerciser, there are cross trainers. There is justification for their popularity for they are comfortable and are engineered to properly support the foot during a particular activity. It has also become acceptable to wear sneakers with street clothes because they just plain feel good. An endorsement by a popular athlete spreads their appeal as well as increases their cost.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum is a shoe style that is uncomfortable, harmful, and impractical. These adjectives describe the women’s shoes with pointed toes and thin, high heels. Doctors say that the pointed toes cause deformities of the feet, and the three to four inch heels are unstable and can cause back problems. With so many negatives, why are these styles consistently popular? Wearers may admit that they are uncomfortable, but say that they are fashionable and that, in time, they get used to them. Historically, people follow fashion, and here again, advertising preys upon this need to keep up with the current trends.\n\nA shoe that can be totally practical, simply fashionable, or a combination of both, is the boot. For cold or inclement weather, no footwear is as desirable as an insulated, rubber-soled boot. Boots are popular because they are practical, long lasting, and a desirable fashion accessory. But there are boots whose entire function is fashion. Yes, these boots have the same pointed toes and spiked heels as the shoes described above, but they are boots because the leather continues high on the leg.\n\nHistorically, shoe styles change, but there are some shoes that are comfortable as well as fashionable, like sandals and sneakers. And, there are those styles some would consider fashionable but harmful to the feet, or worse. If the choice were between comfort or fashion, many people would probably risk discomfort in order to be fashionable.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " ###"}
{"prompt": "Math is a required subject. Explain why it is so important.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If you complain about the universality of math as a required subject, just try and spend one day without encountering some form of mathematics. From page numbers to prices to today’s date, math puts things in order and enables us to compare quantitatively. Figuring how much time is required, how much of an ingredient must be measured, how much carpet to buy, all of these everyday experiences require familiarity with math. To survive financially you must use math to allocate your resources. If you want to invest in a business or in the stock market you must know how to deal with the numbers. Understanding graphs and other analyses about the economy or politics or consumer confidence are enhanced by the applications of math. Mathematical applications in the study of science are essential. Tracking the orbits of planets and the locations of stars in the galaxy cannot be done without numerical comparisons. Every discipline, from archeology to zoology, benefits in some way from the use of mathematics.\n\nPractical reasons for the need for mathematics are omnipresent, but there are other, perhaps more esoteric reasons, for interest in this subject. The amazing coincidences found in numbers provide continual fascination. An example is the fact that the sum of the numbers in the products of the “9-times table” add up to nine. Nine times five equals forty-five, and four plus five equals nine. Similarly, the numbers in the product of seven times nine also equal nine. Mathematicians are also especially fascinated with unique geometric relationships. An example is the fact that three pyramids of the same height will exactly fit into a prism of equal height.\n\nA teacher of mathematics once told me, “Math is in everything,” and some people say, “Mathematics is the something for which the world was written.” These are reasons enough for requiring its study.###"}
{"prompt": "Describe a major environmental problem and what you believe should be done about it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A major environmental problem, the magnitude of which we are just beginning to realize, is global warming. When people say that the winters aren’t as cold as they used to be, or that there was definitely more snow in past years, they are correct. In addition to these personal testimonials, there is concrete visual evidence of global warming. Most noticeable is the depletion of the ice caps. In recent years, glaciers have been receding in greater amounts than in former years. One only has to visit a national park where this recession is marked with signs indicating where the glacier reached in a particular year. The visitor can see how much further away from a particular spot the ice is at the present moment.\n\nWhen the ice caps, made of fresh water, melt, they change the salinity of the oceans, change the currents, and change the conditions for survival for myriad species. Additionally, invasive species might move in, affecting the entire ecosystem. This has a domino effect, as all species are interdependent and survive according to predictable sources of food and living conditions. A specific example recently described on an environmental calendar told of the effect of global warming on polar bears. The bears cannot go out on the melted ice, which is how they get their food. This causes them to lose body fat and even to be unable to give birth to cubs.\n\nGlobal warming causes flooding, and because the warming of the earth causes dryness, fires increase.\n\nWhen speaking of the causes of global warming, some experts say that ice ages followed by warming have been cyclical throughout the eons and that there is not much that can be done about it. However, most scientists believe that the actions of humans have speeded up this process. They blame the increased burning of wood and fossil fuels—oil and coal—on an increasing population needing heat for warmth and cooking. More energy consumption places carbon dioxide and other pollutants in the atmosphere. Warm air trapped around the earth has been deemed the greenhouse effect.\n\nWhile we cannot stop the naturally occurring climate changes, we can try to mitigate the rapid warming by reducing our use of fossil fuels. Much publicity has been given to the love that Americans have for sports utility vehicles which burn an inordinate amount of fuel and which are not required for the kind of ordinary driving done by most owners. There are numerous additional ways in which we can reduce our dependence on these fuels, ranging from insulating our homes, to lowering the thermostat in winter, and raising it when we use air conditioning. Perhaps researchers can develop alternate sources of energy. Presently an automobile is being developed that uses gas initially and then automatically switches to electricity. Theoretically, this car will be able to run for fifty miles on one gallon of gasoline. Additionally, we can support the scientific study of the effects of global warming. Perhaps we can predict such things as where floods will occur or where crops will have difficulty surviving and take steps to overcome these problems.\n\nOne thing is certain. Global warming is a serious environmental problem with ramifications that affect almost every aspect of life.###"}
{"prompt": "Describe how communication has changed in the last twenty years.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Who could have predicted twenty years ago that communication would change as radically as it has? Today, communication is instantaneous. No longer do we have to use a pen, pencil, or typewriter to write a letter. No longer do we have to use a postal service to mail it. No longer do we have to wait for a response that takes several days. Nor do we have to stay near a telephone or search for a public phone while traveling. Things have speeded up exponentially.\n\nIn the last twenty years we have benefited from tremendous changes in telecommunication. The relatively simple change to portable phones enabled us to roam around the house while chatting, not limited by the length of the cord that attaches the receiver to the base of the telephone. Then came the beeper, allowing us to get a message when away from a telephone. Now, of course, there is the ubiquitous cell phone. Watch the crowds walking along a sidewalk, and you can’t help noticing people purposefully striding along while talking on their cell phones.\n\nWhat if we must write a message? We now have e-mail. We send these messages immediately after typing them on the computer keyboard and never have to go to the Post Office. No more “snail mail.” Perhaps we have a written copy that must be sent but cannot be conveniently sent via the computer. Simply dial a phone number, push a few buttons, send a FAX. The copy is transmitted to the receiver at once. The ability to telecommute is almost like handing the copy to the recipient. What a difference twenty years has made. Just as most of us could not imagine the speed and ease of communication in the twenty-first century, we probably cannot anticipate the changes that will occur in the next twenty years. Perhaps we will be able to send instant messages simply by thinking about them, from one brain to the brain of the intended recipient.###"}
{"prompt": "Discuss the events in the life of your favorite author, sports figure, or performer. Explain how these events relate to the person’s achievements.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Herman Melville was a 19th century writer whose works foreshadowed themes that would become prevalent in the 20th century. He wrote about his distaste for the prevalent oppression of underlings, of the need to accept different cultures and to appreciate the contributions of ordinary people. His novels probe into psychological reasons for characters’ actions in a way that would be relevant today.\n\nBorn into a New York family that was prominent, although in constant debt, Melville was forced to end his formal schooling at the age of twelve. He was nevertheless widely read and informed on numerous subjects, including, but not limited to, literature, art, science, biology, navigation, mythology, and geography. Thus, he was largely self-educated, as was Ishmael, the narrator of Moby Dick, Melville’s most acclaimed novel. Ishmael said, “A whale ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.”\n\nJust as Ishmael’s experiential education mirrored Melville’s own informal schooling, so were many other aspects of his life reflected in his writings. Signing up as a cabin boy on a ship going to Liverpool, England, when he was 20, provided Melville with material for the novel, Redburn. The novel was about a lonely 20-year old orphan wandering around Liverpool and is thought to be the writer’s most autobiographical.\n\nMotivated by the need to earn money, Melville signed up for a four-year voyage as a common seaman in spite of the fact that his family connections could have easily gotten him an officer’s commission. Melville had a progressive view about equality that was unusual for his time. He believed in the dignity of all work, which was reflected in his sympathetic, even admiring, excruciatingly detailed, descriptions of the jobs of the working people in his writings. He decried nationalistic prejudice and believed that all people are related. He wrote, “You cannot shed a drop of American blood without shedding blood of the whole world.”\n\nAmong the first white men to explore the South Sea Islands, Melville was surely the first literary artist to do so. Unable to bear the inhumane treatment on this long voyage, he deserted in the Marquesas Islands. He was ill and fortunately was cared for by a kindly native family. A grown son in the family was covered with tattoos, and Melville learned that these people were cannibals who feasted on their enemies. In order to leave, he had to escape, finding refuge on an Australian ship. He deserted from this ship also, landing in Tahiti. These experiences provided material for the novel Typee, about the South Sea Islands, the novel Omoo, based upon his experiences in Tahiti, and the novel White Jacket, which exposed the cruelty of navy flogging. The tattooed man who cared for Melville provided the prototype for Quequeg, one of the most memorable characters in literature.\n\nHerman Melville also was a crewmember of a whaling voyage where he learned the intricacies involved in this type of multi-year voyage that he used as the setting for Moby Dick. This novel, considered a literary masterpiece, provided a forum for Melville’s ideas about the necessity for connectedness. The savage, Quequeg, and the sailor, Ishmael, were mutually supportive of this theme. In addition, Melville was a great believer in democracy and the benefits of diversity, and these beliefs were reflected in his descriptions of the crew on the whaling voyage. The ship was a metaphor for the world, with its crew coming from every known location and background, all being necessary for success. A monomaniacal captain, devoid of empathy, driven by his selfish aims, and unable to connect with others, could only lead to disaster.\n\nThus, Herman Melville’s real-life experiences undoubtedly made possible his descriptive novels, but they would not have been possible without his independently drawn conclusions about the dignity of man and his place in the universe.###"}
{"prompt": "Explain the causes and effects of not voting in elections.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Voting is the privilege for which wars have been fought, protests have been organized, and editorials have been written. “No taxation without representation,” was a battle cry of the American Revolution. Women struggled for suffrage as did all minorities. Eighteen year olds clamored for the right to vote, saying that if they were old enough to go to war, they should be allowed to vote. Yet Americans have a deplorable voting history.\n\nInterviewing people about their voting habits is revealing. There are individuals who state, almost boastfully, that they have never voted. They somehow set themselves apart from the requirements of citizenship in a democracy. Many who avoid voting do so consciously. It is not as if they were ill or unavoidably detained on election day. Often they claim that their one vote doesn’t matter. “What’s one vote?” they ask. Perhaps one vote may not count in some elections, although there have been results determined by one or very few votes. In addition, the total of single votes that are not cast can add up to a significant difference in a particular race. Some people blame the fact that they do not know enough about the issues for their absence from the voting booth. Others say that they avoid learning about the news because it is too depressing. In a democracy, we can express our opinions to our elected leaders, but more than half of us sometimes avoid choosing these people who make the policies that affect our lives.\n\nOne of the effects of this statistic is that politicians will cater to the groups that do vote in large numbers, giving more weight to their needs than to those of other groups or of the general population. Since so many do not vote, elected officials can, with impunity, promote policies that benefit the special interests that contribute financially to the election campaigns. Another effect of not voting is the free rein given to those in office to disregard the expressed opinions of constituents. For if you do not vote, why should the candidate worry about you?\n\nIt seems ironic that in this most democratic of societies, we abrogate the privilege for which so many have struggled. How many countries do not have a choice of candidates, yet their citizens are forced to participate in sham elections? In the United States we have choices. We can vote to fire an officeholder who does not live up to our expectations by choosing an opponent at the next election, and we are free to choose someone whose ideas appeal to us.\n\nPerhaps a major reason for not voting is the failure to convey how precious and unique is the right to vote and how important is each and every vote. The major effect is that we are voluntarily giving up our rights as citizens to ascertain that our elected officials truly represent us. This is because we have not done our part in choosing them so in effect, we are telling these officials that we don’t care enough to bother to vote.###"}

Flexibility and the willingness to try different strategies are the hallmarks of winning coaches. All the talent in the world could be wasted without creative and shrewd coaching.\n\nA player with the ability to sprint, needed both for infield defense and for speedy base running, can be invaluable. A fast runner can steal bases and get to first base with a carefully placed bunt.\n\nGood pitching is essential for a winning baseball team. A pitcher who is “on” is the first line of defense in baseball. It is well known that the pitcher is often the poorest hitter, but it is the pitcher who keeps the opponents from scoring. The pitcher’s teammates accept this and acknowledge that it is their job to score the runs. Here again, a good coach decides who is the optimum pitcher for today’s game, and equally important, when to take a tired or poorly performing pitcher out of the game.\n\nRecruiting strong and consistent batters will be a factor in creating a winning baseball team. Having a home run hitter with several players who can be counted on to get base hits and pinch hits are needed because the best pitching and the best fielding will be for naught if runs aren’t scored.\n\nEven with a plethora of natural ability, to become a winning baseball team, the players must continually practice, not only to maintain their skills, but also to improve them. In fact, a motivated player who practices diligently may eventually surpass those with superior natural ability that is not developed. Along with this desire to continually improve one’s individual playing ability, there is the motivation to succeed because of loyalty to the group. This type of esprit de corps can make the difference between a good and a winning baseball team. Putting the team first, while striving to give one’s all, puts the finishing touches on the recipe \n\nA winning baseball team would need good hitters, fast runners, a skilled pitcher and catcher, and a knowledgable and patient coach. It would also need to have a group of players who got along without any jealousy or hostility and were capable of rooting for each other.\n\nGood hitters and runners are important because you have to get alot of hits and runs to win. You can’t win without scoring runs. Also, the runners need to be speedy, so they can get to the base before the ball gets there. You also have to have a skilled pitcher who can strike people out. The pitcher has to be good or else the other team will score more runs and you will lose. The catcher is important as well because if the catcher drops the ball when the pitcher throws it, that is an error.\n\nFinally, you also need to have a good coach who can help the players improve and who knows when to put certain players in the game and when to take them out. The coach should keep the team running smoothly and solve any fights or disagreements.###"}
{"prompt": "Explain how to choose the right college.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " One of the most important decisions young adults make is where to go to school. Your college education will affect the rest of your life, so you should weigh your options carefully. The “perfect” school may not exist, but I believe there are three factors that are integral to choosing the right college: location, size, and curriculum. You can narrow down your search based on these criteria.\n\nFirst, you should consider location. Some questions you should ask yourself include: Do I prefer to live in a city, the suburbs, or a rural area? Do I want to live in a temperate or colder climate? Do I prefer to be near my family, or in another part of the country? The answers to these questions will help you make the best choice.\n\nSecond, you should consider size. Perhaps your high school experience will affect your choice of colleges. If you attended a small high school with a low teacher-student ratio, you may be accustomed to small class sizes and knowing your fellow students extremely well. On the other hand, if you attended a large high school, you may be used to new faces and larger classes. Would you prefer a school such as UCSB with 50,000 students, or a smaller school with fewer than 5,000 students? Remember, the attention you receive will be affected by the size of the student population.\n\nFinally, in order to choose the right college, you should take the time to decide what you would like to study. Although most colleges offer a myriad of courses, some schools specialize in certain fields and subjects or offer a wider selection of classes. For example, if you are interested in studying the Classics, did you know that the University of Texas has one of the best Classics departments in the United States?\n\nChoosing the right college will require some effort. After you have decided the location, size, and curriculum you prefer, do some research. Learn about different colleges from your guidance counselor, the Internet, or from the colleges themselves. As with any important decision, make sure your choice is an educated one.###"}
{"prompt": "Your new job requires that you move to a different city. Describe the steps you will take to prepare for this move.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Although Americans move more than most people in the world, a move is acknowledged to be one of life’s more stressful experiences. There are, however, steps that can be taken and preparations that can be made which will mitigate the inevitable strain.\n\nIf I were to move to a different city because of a job change, I would find a sponsor in the new location, preferably someone who could give me insight into the kind of situation I could expect at the workplace and about the cultural and other differences in the new community. Different cities may be diverse in many ways: in ideas about appropriate behavior, in social expectations, and even in emotional reactions. If the city had special sites or events to generate civic pride, I would like to investigate those. Or there may be popular gathering places such as parks or cafés. This knowledge would be helpful in getting to understand the attitudes of the residents and to become part of the community.\n\nSpending time with a realtor would be a necessity, not only for finding a satisfactory residence, but also for gaining information about different neighborhoods, schools, libraries, and other community resources. In fact, it would be worthwhile to take the time to deliberately explore the community by walking or driving around.\n\nMy family members are interested in horses, sailing, and playing bridge. As a way to find out how we can pursue these interests and find people similarly inclined, we could visit stables, marinas, or social clubs. Striking up a conversation with people in these places and telling them that I am moving shortly would create a more knowledgeable transition. In addition to picking the brains of people, there may be published material, such as maps and guidebooks, that could be informative. The same is true of Internet sites.\n\nAll this preparation cannot eliminate the probability that leaving my friends, seeing my belongings picked up, packed, and moved to a different city, and facing new routines and new surroundings will be somewhat traumatic. However, visualizing daily life in the new city can help make the move easier and the transition smoother.###"}
{"prompt": "Many people spend a great deal of time with animals. Write about the relationships that people have with animals.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Since they were first domesticated, people have had relationships with animals that have enhanced their lives. Probably animals that were trained to hunt and to retrieve prey were among the first to become valuable to their owners. Useful animals include those used for transportation, for hauling loads, and, in recent times, to assist handicapped people. The latter are usually dogs trained to guide the blind and to care for paraplegics. Although these animals have specific functions, it is probable that a special bond inevitably arises between them and the humans they serve and this goes far beyond the dependency each has for the other.\n\nCan a relationship with an animal improve a person’s health? Many recent reports seem to suggest this possibility. Pets give us abundant and unconditional love. Always happy to see us, our pets allow us to be ourselves, to talk to them, and even to believe that they understand us. When we come home, we might feel reluctant to “talk to ourselves,” but it is perfectly all right to greet, chat, and interact with our dog, cat, bird, and even our fish. Some mental health workers are so insistent upon the beneficial influences of pets that they have an animal present during therapy sessions, claiming that this causes patients to be more relaxed and responsive. Studies have proven that relationships with animals reduce stress and actually can measurably lower blood pressure.\n\nFor people who are depressed or living alone, having a pet is not only therapeutic; it is a means of encouraging a healthier lifestyle. A pet owner must live according to a regular timetable so that the pet can be fed and cared for appropriately. For dog owners, there is an additional social benefit that accrues from having to go outdoors for a walk. Encountering other dog walkers often leads to further social interaction and, perhaps, friendship. For cat owners, there is the admiration for the cat’s characteristic independence, which makes any affection from the cat so much more meaningful. Keeping the bird feeders filled gives a sense of satisfying the needs of creatures that, in turn, delight us with their beauty and their antics.\n\nOther beneficial effects of relationships with animals continue to be discovered. A recent article suggests that kindness to people and animals may be interconnected. Role-playing that increases children’s empathy for animals helps them not only psychologically, but also physically and socially. Another discovery shows that riding horses, for reasons not completely understood, has been shown to benefit autistic children. Pet owners can now volunteer to take their pets to hospitals and nursing homes where residents seem to welcome them.\n\nIt is probable that continued research will shed additional light on what happens when people and animals form a bond. For the present, it is certain that almost anyone can benefit from the resulting security, understanding, fun, laughter, and love that come from having a pet.###"}
{"prompt": "Describe an especially memorable photo or picture.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You might think a memorable picture would have vivid color, an appealing or inspirational theme, or be something you might want to display and look at every day. That is not the case with the picture that is most memorable to me. This picture is really a large mural, painted in 1937 by the Spanish artist, Pablo Picasso, to protest the bombing of a small village in northern Spain.\n\nSurprisingly, there is no vivid red color to show the flowing blood. One must imagine this, for the mural is startlingly gray, black, and white. But there is no avoiding the horror of the images. The figures are not realistically drawn, but are cubist and abstract, and it is apparent that innocent civilians are being slaughtered. A mother screams with her mouth wide open, her head tipped back in heart-rending anguish, as she holds her dead baby. A soldier lies dead on the ground, clutching his broken sword, and three other people are shown in shock and agony. Animals, including a tortured horse and a crying bird, are also portrayed as innocent victims of a massacre. Some symbols are open to interpretation. What is the meaning of the bull, which seems simply to be observing, or of the light bulb emitting rays at the top of the mural? Does the bull symbolize brute force, and does the light bulb signify that there is hope? Yet there is no doubt that the distorted, horrible images are intended to shock the viewer. This depiction of human grief is a profound statement of the cruelty and senselessness of war. Limiting the pictures to black and white adds a funereal element to the shocking depiction of the catastrophe.\n\nThe memory of the picture cannot be forgotten; it is a metaphor for the senselessness and the horror of war. While it was painted to protest atrocities in a long ago war, it is as relevant today as the recollection of the horrors of September 11th. Perhaps it should be shown to all those who contemplate starting a war. Would it be worth it to have another Guernica?###"}

{"prompt": "You want to organize a family reunion. Describe the steps you will take to contact people and to organize the event.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " My family is united genetically but not by proximity. We live in far-flung locations, including three continents and both the northern and southern hemispheres. Some of us have kept in touch while others might as well be considered MIA. It would seem close to impossible to organize a family reunion for such a peripatetic group. Yet, that is what I decided to attempt.\n\nInitially I sent e-mails to all those I regularly heard from and requested any and all addresses of other relatives to be forwarded to me. South Africa was the farthest location and was the source of some previously unknown addresses. Internet searches yielded still more. How delighted I was that there seemed to be universal interest in the project. Several people volunteered to help. We generated a list and added to it as soon as we received further information.\n\nRelatives were located in Alaska, Canada, and six states. Thus the first big hurdle was overcome: the list of potential invitees. Then, with solicited input from all concerned, it was decided to choose a location near New York, the original point of origin of the family.\n\nIt then became necessary to choose a site for the get-together and then to find accommodations for approximately fifty-five people ranging in age from under one year to eighty-five. An all-suite hotel, which agreed to charge reduced rates if a minimum number of reservations were confirmed was selected. The hotel agreed to hold rooms for us until two weeks prior to the weekend of the get-together. A list of nearby motels and bed and breakfasts was also compiled. We now had the who, where, and when, the latter being the last weekend in September when the weather was still moderate and travel not likely to be a problem. Why we were getting together seemed obvious. There was curiosity to catch up, and even to meet relatives known only by reputation.\n\nNow we came to the question of how the weekend would be organized. Since most people would be arriving on Friday, that day was to be relaxed and unstructured. On Saturday, there would be games and an informal picnic lunch in a nearby county park, the permission for which was easily obtained. Saturday night would be the highlight, a catered dinner in a restaurant which could easily hold a group of this size. People had been asked to bring photos and anecdotes and a list of speakers was generated. The youngest members would be introduced and those traveling great distances would be recognized. The oldest members might wish to share their reminiscences. Sunday would again be an informal day, probably punctuated with hugs, the sharing of addresses, and promises to do this again. All of the activities would be recorded on videos and a digital camera so that they could easily be forwarded via e-mail. Thus the planning for a family reunion must begin well in advance of the date. Planners must seek out addresses of the relatives, must settle on a location, a date, and, of course, a place to stay. These would vary according to the size and needs of the group. Some groups might prefer to simply chat informally while others would appreciate planned activities. Once a family has done this, a second reunion would be much easier. The addresses are known, faces can be associated with names, and an evaluation of the previous schedule can be solicited. One caveat: have alternate plans in case of bad weather.###"}

// Narrative
{"prompt": "People often say “Don’t judge a book by its cover.” Describe a time when you misjudged someone based on his or her appearance or when someone misjudged you.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When Maria Mariella Panontin first showed up at our school, here’s what I thought: Look at that girl. She dresses like she’s some exotic gypsy or something. Looks like a real high-maintenance kind of girl. Not my type; I’m not going to bother trying to get to know her.” So I didn’t. Too late, I realized what a mistake I’d made.\n\nMaria Mariella (she went by both names) was a foreign exchange student from Italy who was staying with a friend of mine, Joanne. Joanne and I weren’t that close, but we hung out in the same general crowd, so when the extended clique got together, Maria Mariella was often part of the group. We were friendly to each other, but we never tried to become friends until Shanda’s party.\n\nI wasn’t planning on going to Shanda’s party because I had a big track meet the next day, but my friend Elaine convinced me to go for a little while. When I was saying goodbye, Joanne rushed up to me.\n\n“Hey, Jenine, can you do me a really big favor? Maria Mariella needs to go home, but I want to stay. Would you mind dropping her off at my house?” I didn’t really want to, but it was on the way, and I would have looked like a real jerk if I said no, so I said, “Sure, no problem.” Maria Mariella was right behind Joanne. I looked at her and said, “Let’s go.”\n\nWe hopped into my car. As I was pulling out of the driveway, I popped in a 10,000 Maniacs cassette and turned the radio up loud.\n\n“I love this song!” Maria Mariella shouted over the music.\n\n“Really?” Not even my American friends appreciated this band. “You like the 10,000 Maniacs?”\n\n“I love them,” she said with her heavy Italian accent.\n\nAfter that, it seemed like Maria Mariella and I couldn’t stop talking to one another and finding things in common. I loved that she was straightforward and honest, like me. She shared my taste in music and film. We both had crushes on the same movie stars. It felt like a friendship that was meant to be.\n\nThen, just two weeks later, Maria Mariella threw a party at Joanne’s house. It was a going away party. Her mother had developed a serious illness, and Maria Mariella was going home to be with her. At that party, a group of us were playing Truth or Dare, one of our favorite games. It was Maria Mariella’s turn.\n\n“Truth!” she said. “Name something you regret,” our friend Denise demanded.\n\nMaria Mariella pointed a long finger at me. “I wish I’d taken the time to get to know you sooner. I didn’t think you were worth my time.”\n\nA sad smile came across my face. “I thought the same thing, Maria Mariella,” I said. “That is something I’m always going to regret.”###"}
{"prompt": "It has been said that the truth is often stranger than fiction. Describe an experience you had that was so strange others might think you made it up.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " My friends still think I made this story up, even though they’ve never known me to be a liar. When it happened I couldn’t believe it myself, but it’s true. This really happened.\n\nMy best friend and I were working one summer as line chefs in the Marriott at the sprawling TanTara Resort on the Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri. One Tuesday morning, as I walked through the kitchen to get to the time clock, half a dozen people said to me, “Uh-oh, man, the executive chef wants to see you.” The executive chef? But I hadn’t done anything wrong. What could he want? Why was I in trouble?\n\nI clocked in and knocked on the executive chef’s door. “Listen,” he said angrily when I sat down, “I don’t know what you guys did or how you did it, but you and your buddy Jim have off on Friday.” Friday was our busiest night; no one gets off on Friday without a very good reason. “Just one thing,” he said sternly as I got up to go, “Don’t you guys tell anyone why you’re not coming in. Understand?”\n\n“Understand,” I replied, but I had no idea what he was talking about. I had to find Jim as soon as possible and figure out what was going on. But every time I asked Jim about it, he simply said, “I’ll tell you later. Just don’t worry about it.” No matter how much I begged, he wouldn’t tell me what was going on and why we had the day off. By Thursday night, he still hadn’t told me what was happening Friday. As we were watching TV in our apartment, he said, “Let’s hit the sack early tonight. We’re going to need lots of rest for tomorrow.” Jim never went to bed early. What on earth was going on?\n\nIn the morning, Jim woke me up (another anomaly) and told me to get a quick shower, put on my bathing suit, and pack a change of clothes. A few minutes later, a dark SUV with tinted windows pulled up in front of our building. “There’s our ride,” Jim said with a secretive smile. We walked out to the car, but I wasn’t getting in without an explanation. So Jim shoved me in. Inside, I looked up, and there in the passenger seat was Hugh Jackman.\n\nNow Jim had no choice but to explain. It turns out that a friend of a friend of Jim’s knew Hugh Jackman and knew that Hugh wanted to get away for a totally private vacation between films. This friend said that he knew two guys at a large secluded lake in Missouri who would “take care of him.” So ____ called the executive chef and asked for me and Jim to have the day off.\n\nWe spent the day out on the lake with Hugh, water-skiing, fishing, eating, drinking, and telling stories. We did our best to treat him like just another guy spending the day with a couple of new friends. We didn’t ask him anything about Hollywood or his latest high-profile romance; we just let him relax and be himself for a day without cameras or fans.\n\nAt the end of the day, as we pulled back into the dock, he said, “Listen, guys, I had a really good time today. It was just what I needed. I appreciate it, man.” He shook our hands. “One favor, though?” he asked. “Don’t tell anybody about this. If people find out I’m here, I won’t get any peace and quiet. I need some time alone.”\n\n“No problem,” we said, and headed home. The next day, everyone kept asking what was so special that we had to have Friday off. The night was a disaster for the kitchen, and they were all upset that we hadn’t been there. All we could say was, “Nothing, man, nothing. We were just hanging out.” We had a great time, too, and we kept our promise.###"}

Tell about a time when you had to face one of your greatest fears.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Every kid in the neighborhood knew the Robinson house and avoided it like a bowl of Brussels sprouts. Mr. Robinson was a notorious crank, the house was always dark and creepy, and his dog was a terror—a mean, fang-toothed creature that looked like she would love to tear you apart.\n\nThe dog’s name was Angel, but she scared the devil out of us. She was half pit bull, half Doberman pinscher. Mr. Robinson kept her out on the front lawn, chained to a thin pole stuck in the ground near his front door. It was a long chain, and when I walked past the house to the bus stop, Angel always bounded toward me, barking furiously. One of these times that chain will break, I thought, and I’ll be Angel’s dinner. When I got to the Robinson house, I always walked past it as quickly as I could. Sometimes I could see Mr. Robinson watching from the window, laughing.\n\nThen it happened. We had gotten our report cards in school that day, and I was so proud of my marks and my teachers’ comments that I just had to look at them again on my way home from the bus stop. I was so wrapped up in that report card that I didn’t realize how close I was to Mr. Robinson’s house, and Angel startled me when she started barking. I dropped my report card, and just then, a big gust of wind took the paper up into the air. It landed right smack in the middle of Mr. Robinson’s lawn, about two feet away from Angel.\n\nAngel, growling ferociously, was straining her chain, trying to get closer to me. I could see her long canines. I could even smell her from where I was standing. I think I was shaking. But I needed to get that report card back. My mom had to sign it. Besides, she had to see those fantastic grades.\n\nI thought about yelling for Mr. Robinson, but I was just as afraid of him as of the dog. So I decided to see if maybe, just maybe, Angel would let me get close enough to get that piece of paper.\n\nI remembered my uncle telling me that dogs can sense your fear, and that most dogs will be friendly if you approach them in the right manner. So I did my best not to look scared. I straightened up, softened my face, and walked slowly toward Angel. She kept barking and growling. Saliva was dripping from her chin. I closed my eyes and gulped. I was about six feet away from Angel, and I put my fist out in front of me for her to smell, saying, “Here, girl. Nice girl. Good girl,” as calmly as I could. But she was barking so loudly and angrily that I’m sure she didn’t hear a word.\n\nInside, I had never been more frightened. This dog is going to tear me to pieces, I thought. But I kept going, slowly. I had never earned such good marks before. I wasn’t going to let a crazy old dog keep me from showing that report card to my parents.\n\nI was about three steps away from Angel when the wind blew again, this time sending my report card just out of Angel’s reach. I didn’t have to confront that dog after all. It was a good thing, too—Mr. Robinson later told my folks that Angel surely would have bitten me badly. I realized that what I’d planned to do was dangerous and that I was simply being stubborn. But part of me was proud, because I was brave enough to try to get close to Angel.###"}
{"prompt": "Moving can be a very exciting but also difficult time in one’s life. Tell about a time you moved and how it affected you.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As the new kid in town, I was eager—ok, desperate—to make new friends, and fast. My dad had just accepted a promotion that required a transfer, and we moved from Chicago to Oakland, California, just a few days before I was to begin the sixth grade. I didn’t even have a chance to get to know any of the kids in the neighborhood.\n\nAfter the first day of school, I could tell that Charlie Jenkins was the one who would make me or break me. He was a bully for sure, but he was so good-looking and charming that everyone seemed to like him. He was clearly the center of power in that classroom, and I knew I would have to win his approval. I just wasn’t sure what I’d have to do to get it.\n\nMy answer came at the end of the third week of school, when Ms. Harcourt gave us our second writing assignment. We’d been reading and discussing fables, and now it was our turn to write our own. That afternoon, Charlie cornered me on the playground.\n\nHe teased me about being a new kid, yet he seemed interested in the fact that I was a good writer. Our teacher, Ms. Harcourt had read aloud one of my poems in class just yesterday, and obviously he was paying attention. I admitted that I had a flair for writing, and at first I was flattered that he noticed. But, he had an ulterior motive.\n\n“Hey, new kid, hold on a second,” he said, standing between the gate and me. “You seem to be pretty good with writing.”\n\n“Yeah, you do alright, alright,” he replied. “I’ll tell you what,” he said, moving closer, until his face was just a few inches from mine. “Why don’t you just write an extra fable, one for you, one for me? Let me see what you can do.”\n\nSo that was it. I was going to do Charlie’s English homework for him. That was the price I was going to pay to be accepted.\n\nCharlie didn’t wait for an answer. “Bring two fables to school on Monday,” he said. That would give him time to copy it over into his own handwriting to submit to Ms. Harcourt on Tuesday.\n\nOver the weekend, I wrote two fables, both of them quite good, I thought, but one was definitely better than the other. On Monday morning, I met Charlie in the schoolyard as planned.\n\n“Here’s your fable,” I said to Charlie, handing him a piece of paper. I gave Charlie the fable that I thought was inferior, keeping the better fable for myself, and turned to walk away.\n\nHe questioned me about the quality of the paper, read it quickly, and decided that it passed muster. Without saying thank you or goodbye, he swaggered off into the building.\n\nA few days later, Ms. Harcourt returned our fables. I looked at my paper, expecting to see an A or A+, but my grade was an A-. Then I looked over at Charlie. He was holding his paper up high so I could see his grade: A+. I knew the fable I’d kept for myself was better. Perhaps Charlie’s charm was factored into his grade.\n\nFortunately, I only had to do one more assignment for Charlie before he and his family abruptly moved to another town. Now Charlie was going to be the new kid in the classroom. I often wondered what he had to do there to be accepted.###"}
{"prompt": "As the saying goes, “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” Describe a time when you persisted until you achieved your goal.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In seventh grade, I had a best friend who was an incredible athlete. I was pretty coordinated myself, but because I was so insecure, I never seemed to be any good at sports. I was so afraid of missing the ball that I would be sure to swing and miss, even if it was right over the plate. But Katie was my best friend, and if she joined a team, I did, too. Or at least I tried. Katie was a starter for the junior varsity field hockey team; I sat on the bench all season. Katie played regularly in JV basketball; I was cut during tryouts. I figured I was headed for a similar fate with lacrosse. But Katie was my best friend, so I signed up anyway.\n\nKatie was a natural, and she picked up the new sport quickly. I, on the other hand, couldn’t seem to hold the lacrosse stick comfortably. I caught one out of ten throws, if I was lucky, and my tosses were always way off their mark. I was clumsy and feeling clumsier, and I thought maybe it was time to give it up. But that would create an even wider gulf between Katie and me. Already she was spending more and more time with the girls who, like her, excelled at sports. I was beginning to be left behind.\n\nDetermined to stick it out and save our friendship, I begged my mom to take me to a sporting goods store and buy me an early birthday present: my own lacrosse stick and ball so I could practice at home. Katie was impressed with my stick, but I could tell that she thought it was a waste of money. She figured I would never get to use that stick in a game.\n\nI was hurt by her reaction, and again I felt the distance between us. If I was going to keep Katie as a friend, I thought, I simply had to get the hang of this sport. It was my last chance. Somehow, someway, I had to learn how to throw and catch the ball in that net and be respectable on the playing field.\n\nSo I practiced, and I practiced, and I practiced some more. I often felt like there was no hope, and I broke two windows in the garage, but I kept at it.\n\nThen, one day, just after the first official game of the season (during which I sat on the bench), something happened. I paired off with Suzie, who had become my partner since Katie had quickly proven to be too good to play with me. That day, when Suzi sent me her first throw, I caught it. When I threw the ball back to her, I hit her stick dead on. I caught her next throw, and the next. Something was happening. I was getting it. The stick was actually feeling good in my hands. The movements were becoming natural. I was catching and throwing the ball accurately.\n\nI still don’t know what exactly happened that day, but I will always be grateful for it. By the end of the season, I was starting for the JV team. I scored 12 goals that year, and the next year I was playing varsity. My success on the field gave me confidence that I desperately needed. Katie and I continued to drift apart, but Suzie turned out to be a great friend. She quit after the first year, but she came to every game to cheer me on.###"}

My parents were very active in their church, and they had arranged to deliver clothing and food donations to a church in a deeply impoverished area on the edge of the Appalachian Mountains, a four-hour drive from our home.\n\nI’d seen pictures of poverty before, of course. But seeing a picture of a shack with seven malnourished children and actually walking into such a shack are two entirely different things. The pastor of the church took us into a few homes so we could deliver some of the items (a crib, a box of linens, canned goods) personally. I had never felt so uncomfortable before. These people had so little! Eight family members living in two rooms . . . no electricity or running water . . . no couches or microwaves or cable television . . . soon I began to realize just how lucky I was. True, I didn’t have as much as my friends. But I had so much more than the people we visited that day. I felt greedy and guilty for having so many things.\n\nWhen we got back home, I got on the Internet and found a soup kitchen not too far from our home.

{"prompt": "We are often surprised, even awed, by the experiences of our ancestors. Describe a time when you learned something important about your family history.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " My dad wasn’t the type to talk much about anything, and he was especially quiet about his past. There were a few things I knew: He’d come over from Hungary in 1956, after the Revolution. He’d fought with the rebels in Budapest. He was a toolmaker in Hungary, and he was a toolmaker here. He left behind his parents and 11 brothers and sisters, who still lived in the countryside. They exchanged letters once or twice a year. That was about all I knew.\n\nThe summer that I was fourteen, my dad received one of those letters. In it was the news that one of his brothers had died. Maybe it was the realization that he was so out of touch with his family. Maybe it was his own mortality he was facing. In any case, a few days after the letter came, he told me about his role in the Hungarian Revolution and his escape from Hungary.\n\nThe Hungarian Revolution began with a massive student protest on October 23, 1956, and ended just a few weeks later in November after the city was invaded by Soviet tanks and the rebellion crushed. My dad, just 22 years old, had decided to join the students who were protesting the Communist regime, and soon he was not just a protester but a soldier, and not just a soldier but an officer in the rebel army. “Wait a minute,” he said, and he returned with a tattered copy of LIFE magazine’s special issue devoted to the Hungarian Revolution. He flipped through the pages, showing me image after image of buildings demolished by bombs, rebels fighting on foot against tanks, bodies lying in the street. Then he found the picture he was looking for. “There,” he said, pointing to a window in an abandoned, bullet-ridden building. “I was hiding in there, throwing Malotov cocktails at the Russian tanks.”\n\nIt’s a long and fascinating story, and I wanted to know all the details. How did he get involved? How did he escape? How close was he to being captured or killed? I had so many questions. But the question I wanted answered most was this: Why did he fight? At that age, I was just starting to find my footing in the swampy ground of ethics and moral stances. I was having a tough time figuring out what I believed in, and I wanted desperately to understand how someone could believe in something so strongly that he would be willing to die for it.\n\nWhy did he do it? There were a lot of reasons, he said. For one thing, the Communist regime was ruining the economy. As a toolmaker with several years of experience, he had a better salary than most, but still, he said, “I couldn’t afford both clothes and food.” If he respected the government, he would have been able to live with that. “But what I couldn’t live with,” he said, “was not being able to say what I wanted. The Communists, they had all kinds of restrictions on everything. You couldn’t go to the next town without the proper permissions and papers. And you couldn’t say anything, not anything, against the government, or else they’d put you in jail, or worse. They’d come and get you late at night and no one in your family would ever see you again.” That’s what happened to his best friend, Attila. He disappeared the night of September 22, and no one ever heard from him again.\n\nMy dad often complains about America. The politicians are crooks, criminals have too many rights, schools and parents aren’t strict enough with children, and the taxes are “an abomination.” But I don’t need to remind him that at least in this country, he can complain as loudly as he pleases.###"}

It was the standard small-town fair: a ferris wheel, a fun house, a giant slide, and dozens of booths where you could buy greasy food and try to win cheap stuffed animals for your date.\n\nThat’s where I was, with my date—sort of. We weren’t actually in the fairgrounds. We were in his car in the parking lot, stealing some time together. I was 16, but I wasn’t allowed to date, and I had the sort of father who just might come to the fair to check up on me to make sure I wasn’t hanging out with any boys.\n\nKeith had borrowed his mom’s Buick Skylark, as usual. REO Speedwagon’s “I Can’t Fight This Feeling” was playing on the radio when Keith rather abruptly ended a kiss, interrupting what I thought had been a perfectly nice romantic moment.\n\n“I have something to tell you,” he said. He wouldn’t look me in the eye. My heart dropped to the floor. He’s going to break up with me, I thought in horror.\n\nBut that’s not what happened. In fact, I never could have guessed at what Keith was about to tell me.\n\nHe took a deep breath and looked straight ahead at the windshield. “Your mom was married to someone else before she married your dad,” he said softly. “You have an older brother. He lives in North Carolina.”\n\nI know what you’re thinking, because it’s exactly what I was wondering, too: How on Earth did Keith know this? He guessed what I was thinking, and said:\n\n“My mom told me.” Then, before I could ask, he added: “Edie told her.” Edie was his mother’s hairdresser.\n\nFinding out that I had an older brother was a shock enough. To find out from my boyfriend, who found out from his mother, who found out from her hairdresser—that was just too much. I was too overwhelmed to respond.\n\nAfter a few minutes of silence during which Keith held my hand, what Keith told me about how he found out began to make sense. Edie was the daughter of my dad’s best friend, Samuel. Though our families were no longer close, when I was young, we spent a lot of time together. Edie and her older sister used to babysit my sister and me. It wouldn’t be so unlikely for her to pick up a family secret or two.\n\nKeith’s mom had told him what Edie told her because she believed it was proof that I wasn’t good enough to be his girlfriend. He wanted me to know about my brother, of course, but he also wanted me to know that he was going to have to cool it for a while until his mom got over it.\n\nThe next day, I told my mom that I knew about my brother. At first, she looked shocked; then she looked relieved, as if a tremendous burden had been lifted. She was glad I knew, although she was sorry about the way in which I’d found out. She gave me my brother’s phone number and told me I could call whenever I was ready.\n\nToday, my brother and I talk regularly, and he is one of my closest friends. One of these days, I have to thank Edie for being such a gossip.###"}

We were going to have a party in school and a party at my house after school. My relatives from Ohio were coming, my mom was going to bake my favorite cake, and my brother and his friends were going to DJ. I spent weeks making up the play list, though I might as well have just handed over my pile of Beach Boys albums, because just about every song I chose was a Beach Boys tune. I was the biggest Beach Boys fan on the East coast.\n\nThe day before my birthday, however, I came down with the chicken pox. Everything for the next day was cancelled, and I stayed home from school, itchy and cranky. I refused to get out of my pajamas or be civil to anyone. I just sat in my room, playing my Beach Boys albums and feeling miserable. The next day, my birthday, I was still itchy and cranky as can be, a total wretch. Until HE called.\n\nJust after lunch and my third “Three Stooges” episode, the phone rang. It was my dad telling me I had to believe his next statement. I rolled my eyes but agreed.\n\n“In a few minutes, Brian Wilson is going to call you,” he said.\n\n“That’s not funny, Dad,” I replied.\n\nHe assured me that it would happen and hung up. He told me I had to believe him and to answer the phone when it rang.\n\nWas he playing a joke on me? No, he couldn’t be. My dad knew how much I loved the Beach Boys, and to play a joke of this sort would be too cruel. He must be serious, I thought, but I couldn’t believe it.\n\n“Okay,” I said to myself as I placed the receiver down. The Brian Wilson was going to call me? I sat in a daze. Then, before I had a chance to digest what my father said, the phone rang. I thought it was my dad calling back to say he was just teasing. It wasn’t.\n\nAt the other end of the line was none other than the Brian Wilson. I don’t really remember what he said beyond that; once I realized it really was Brian Wilson, I went into a mild state of shock. He must have thought I was a terrible conversationalist because I could only say “yeah” or “no” to most of his questions. After a few minutes, he said goodbye. I hung up the phone, screamed, and cried.###"}

In the fall, we sewed duffel bags and pillows shaped like animals. In the spring, we learned how to cook.\n\nFor our final cooking class project, we had to cook a dish at home and bring it to class. I knew right away what I was going to make: my Aunt Rosie’s famous chocolate cake.\n\nMy aunt Rosie made the best chocolate cake in the world. It was a recipe she had gotten from her grandmother, who swore her grandmother had personally made that chocolate cake for the Prince of Wales. When I started the cooking class, I had asked Aunt Rosie what made her chocolate cake so special. She told me the secret ingredient was coffee.\n\nI had never tried to bake a cake from scratch before, and since the chocolate cake was Aunt Rosie’s specialty, I thought for sure she would help me make it.\n\n“But that would be cheating,” she said as a she handed me the recipe. “You go home and you make it yourself. Make sure you save a piece for me!” she hollered as I headed out the door.\n\nAt home, I got out my ingredients: eggs, butter, milk, sugar, fine powdered chocolate, cinnamon, baking powder, and coffee. The recipe looked easy enough, and I followed each step carefully. When I had mixed everything together, I carefully poured the batter into the pan. I put the cake into the oven, which I had preheated as directed, and set a timer for 50 minutes. When the buzzer went off, I stuck a toothpick into the middle of the cake to make sure it was done. It was perfect.\n\nWhen the cake cooled, I opened up a can of Betty Crocker’s chocolate frosting, spread a thick layer on top of the cake, and covered it with plastic wrap. It was a masterpiece, and I couldn’t wait for my classmates to taste it.\n\nThe next morning, I carried my cake carefully to school. I passed out pieces to my classmates, beaming with pride. But when I saw the look on their faces, I knew something was terribly wrong. I took a bite and nearly burst into tears. No wonder they looked disgusted! Aunt Rosie’s cake was never crunchy, and the crunchy things were bitter. The cake tasted awful. My heart sank as I watched Mrs. Wilson take a bite. She crunched, paused, crunched again, paused again, and looked at me thoughtfully.\n\n“Sarah,” she said gently, “does the recipe for this cake call for coffee?”\n\n“Yes,” I replied.\n\n“Hmmm. I thought so.”\n\nWhen I questioned her about my mistake, she said, “You used coffee grounds. You were supposed to use liquid coffee,” she said, and she laughed gently.\n\nI was mortified. I vowed to correct my mistake and make a new cake for tomorrow.\n\nThis time, with a real cup of coffee, I baked a cake that would have made Aunt Rosie proud.###"}

Whether it was a miracle, or fate, or just plain luck, I’m still here to tell this story.\n\nIt was a Monday morning, just about 8:15. I was actually a little early for once and was glad I didn’t have to race to work. It was my second week as a bank teller at Harrison Savings and Loan.\n\nThere had been some freezing rain earlier that morning, but the roads seemed clear as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned left at the light, right at the Dunkin Donuts, and then left again onto the onramp for Route 61. I sped up to merge with the oncoming rush-hour traffic when suddenly I felt my car, a brand new Durango, lose control. I’d hit a patch of ice.\n\nWhat happened next probably lasted no more than fifteen seconds, but if felt like hours. I spun around like a top, turning two full revolutions as I crossed the two southbound lanes. Then I hit the median strip and the car flipped over as it crossed into the northbound traffic. I skidded across the highway and the car stopped in the right-hand lane. There I was, upsidedown and backwards, after crashing across four lanes, and somehow I was alive. Somehow I hadn’t hit a single car.\n\nBut I had no time to appreciate that miracle, because when I looked out the shattered windshield, I saw an 18-wheeler was bearing down upon me at about 65 miles an hour. There was no time to get out of the car.\n\nI screamed and braced myself for the impact. But instead of hearing the crunch of metal crashing into metal, I heard the screeching of brakes as the truck swerved around me, just in time to avoid a head-on collision. The truck skidded to a stop on the shoulder about a hundred feet away from me. Then the driver jumped out and ran over to see if I was okay.\n\nThat night at home, I eased my aching body into bed. But I was climbing into my own bed, in my own room, not in the hospital. Somehow, the only injuries I sustained were a few cuts on my face and hands, a bruised right shoulder, and two bruised calf muscles. My new car was totaled, but I didn’t care.

My bike was a beauty: pink all over, with a stylish banana seat, iridescent fringes hanging off the handle bars, and a white woven basket with big, pink flowers on the front.\n\nIt was a Monday afternoon and I was alone, riding my bike in circles in the driveway. I was exalting in my freedom: no more training wheels, no more big brother or father pushing me from behind and holding me steady. Now I could start, stop, and ride all by myself, and I went around and around our circular driveway in complete bliss.\n\nThe sun shone on my face and made the black pavement hot, even though it was already late September. Emboldened by the warmth of the sun and the excitement of my success—eight laps around and I hadn’t fallen yet—I decided it was time to leave the safety of the circle and ride down the steep hill that led to the road on which we lived: Route 309, a four-lane, heavily-traveled highway. I warmed up with another two or three turns around the circle and then eased to my right and down the slope.\n\nFrom the start of the circle to the edge of the highway, the driveway ran about 200 feet at an even 45 degrees. I began to pick up a lot of speed at 50 feet, more at 75, and by 100 feet I was flying. The road was getting closer; I could see the faces of the people driving by at 50, 60, 70 miles an hour. It was time to slow down, but I couldn’t. I kept going faster, and faster, and I couldn’t stop. In my panic, I forgot how to use the brakes.\n\nIn an instant I was out on the highway, a little pink streak that zoomed across all four lanes and somehow, someway, ended up on the other side, up on the Zeigler’s lawn, in one piece. In the seconds that it took me to cross the road, there had not been a single car. An instant later, they were back, and I had to wait several minutes before I slowly, shakily, walked my bike back across the street and up the driveway.\n\nI never told anyone about what happened, and it was a long, long time before I ventured down that slope again. When I did, I used my brakes the whole way down. This time, I wasn’t going to forget.###"}
{"prompt": "We all need help from others from time to time. Tell about a time you helped someone in need.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " It was the hottest day of the summer, a record-breaking 102 degrees, hot and humid, sweltering even in the shade. I was driving back from visiting my older brother and his new baby. In the blistering heat, I could see the blacktop bubbling. I’d never been so grateful for air conditioning before.\n\nI cruised happily along County Route 2, which wound through the northern tip of the Sonoran Desert. Then I saw that a car had broken down up ahead. It was the first car I’d seen in about half an hour. In the distance, a few hundred feet ahead of the car, I saw a stooped figure walking with a gas can in his hands. There was nothing around for miles. There was no way this person was going to make it to the nearest town, which was a good twenty miles away, in this desert heat.\n\nI’d always been told to stay away from strangers, but I thought if there ever was a time to do a good deed, this was it. Besides, as I neared the figure, I could tell that it was an elderly man, and I thought there was little chance he’d do me any harm. So I slowed down and pulled over. “Need a lift?” I asked.\n\nNow that I could see him clearly, it was obvious the old man was already in trouble. He’d only walked a hundred yards or so, and he looked as if he was going to pass out any moment. “I’d be most grateful, young lady, if you could help me get to a gas station,” he said slowly. “I seem to be out of petroleum.”\n\n“No problem,” I replied. “I’m headed that way.”\n\nHe climbed slowly into the car and I pulled back out onto the road. “Not a good day for car trouble, huh?” I asked.\n\n“Indeed,” he replied. He was silent for a few minutes while his body temperature normalized. I offered him a soda from the cooler I’d packed for my four-hour ride. He accepted it gratefully. We made a little small talk then, but just a little. He seemed to prefer the silence.\n\nAs we neared the gas station, I asked him if he would like a ride back to his car. “I don’t have to be home until late this afternoon,” I told him. “It’s no trouble.”\n\n“I know it is quite out of your way,” he replied. “I would be most grateful.” He paused. “And just where is home, young lady?”\n\n“Elmwood,” I replied. I introduced myself as Emily Hampton and found out that he was Edward Gilliam. “By the way, my name is Emily. Emily Hampton.”\n\n“You’re a very kind lady, Ms. Hampton. My name is Edward Gilliam.” Edward filled up his gas can and I drove him back to his car. We filled up his tank, and I followed him back into town just to make sure he was ok. At the gas station, I beeped and waved and continued north towards home. Edward waved and nodded his thanks.\n\nThe next morning, the doorbell rang. My mom answered. “Emily!” she hollered. “Get down here!” I came down the stairs and saw a giant bouquet of flowers. They were stunning. A small note was attached:\n\n“Dearest Emily, thank you for your incredible kindness yesterday. You just might have saved my life, and I am eternally grateful. You reminded an old man of how much beauty there is in this world. Yours, Edward Gilliam.”###"}

// Literary Response Prompts
{"prompt": "Tone is the mood or feeling the author intends the reader to experience. Using a specific piece of literature, explain how tone enhances the work.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Writers for TV sitcoms or movies are fortunate. Visuals often convey tone much more conveniently than words. Writers have to be very skillful in word choice in order to evoke emotions. While I began to explore Edgar Allan Poe’s works, I was intrigued with the way Poe carefully chose language and with the way it evoked a very certain mood or tone.\n\nIn Poe’s “The Tell-Tale Heart”, I was amazed with the way the main character could grow to hate someone’s physical appearance so much so that he could stare at him for hours on end. The plot of this story revolves around a young man who rents a room from an elderly man in a large, dark mansion. This is how Poe begins to create the tone or mood. If the setting were in a house with a white picket fence in Pleasantville, the setting might not be as effective for suspense or horror. However, Poe begins to masterfully build suspense in “The Tell-Tale Heart”. For example, the deranged tenant slowly opens the elderly man’s bedroom door at night and stares at his glass eye for hours in a seething rage. He does this numerous times, to where the reader begins to understand that this man is far from normal. His obsession leads him to commit a horrible crime.\n\nThe rage this man feels about the eye finally comes to a point wherein he attacks the man and suffocates him in his bed. Afterwards, he dismembers his corpse and hides the pieces under the floorboards. By now, the reader is in complete disbelief and awe at such a heinous, non-provoked attack, that we must continue reading. The tone becomes very eerie, and will soon turn suspenseful.\n\nFinally, the police investigate the home after a neighbor reported hearing screams coming from the house. The deranged man invites the police in, and invites them to sit with him in the room where the corpse lies. Poe now adds to the tone with more suspense and a feeling of anxiety to whether the man will confess to the murder. While speaking with the police, the man begins to hear a faint heartbeat that continues to grow in volume. However, he is the only one who hears the noise. The man attempted to cunningly fool the police officers while sitting on the corpse, only to now mentally break down from the noise inside his mind to where he confesses. The torture this man evokes on himself adds tremendously to the tone of the story.\n\nJust as Poe creates an eerie, intense, and twisted tone to his fiction, authors can lead their readers to feel certain emotions through their writing.###"}
{"prompt": "In the novel, The Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, a group of boys are stranded on a remote island to fend for themselves. Compare/contrast this novel to the popular television show Survivor. Use specific details in your answer.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " William Golding’s novel The Lord of the Flies explores many themes such as the dark side of human nature, allegiances, and how these boys mirror larger society. I feel as if the producers of the popular television show “Survivor” used this novel as the framework of their show. Both Golding’s novel and the show have many similarities.\n\nWhen the show “Survivor” premiered, I immediately thought of the novel The Lord of the Flies. The novel is about a group of schoolboys who are shipwrecked on a deserted island. The boys attempt to create a “civilization,” but ultimately transform into mere savages. This is an important novel for the psychological study Golding presents. One can’t help but draw parallels to adult society. There is a true need for structure and control in any society, but the means of that control makes this novel all the more interesting.\n\nOne of the boys, Jack, is power-hungry and represents dictatorship. Some of the other boys such as Simon and Piggy try to do what is safe and conservative. The character of Ralph is symbolic of democracy and fairness. Throughout the novel, the boys engage in a power struggle and end up destroying one another. Golding’s use of symbolism forces the reader to see characters and situations as larger ideas. The boys realize that they must create some type of order.\n\nSimilar to the television show “Survivor”, the boys hold council meetings, use objects as a symbol of strength, and use fire as a symbol of hope. I remember watching the show and observing a contestant who won a physical contest against the other players. This person was given a pillow to use, whereas the other contestants had nothing. The pillow symbolizes power, as did the conch in the novel. Also, whenever the show’s council met on Sunday nights, they all brought their torches. When someone was voted off the island (seen as a liability or risk to the welfare of the group), that person’s torch was extinguished, thus eliminating hope. Alliances were formed and these alliances pitted the contestants against each other. Ultimately the winner was the most cunning player who could convince the other members to follow them. This is exactly the situation that occurred between Ralph and Jack in the novel.\n\nWilliam Golding’s novel allows the reader to explore human nature and mankind. Often, we do not like to face the psychological aspects of our being. “Survivor” emulates the same underlying motives that form our nature.###"}
{"prompt": "Using a specific literary work, explain how a novel might influence change in society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Have you ever read a story that ultimately changed the way in which you thought about the world?\n\nSo often we form our opinions and lifestyles from our families and what we observe around us. Could it be possible that a novel might change the way in people’s thinking? After reading Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mockingbird, I realized for the first time how complex racism was, and the necessity for societal change.\n\nI have always been aware of cultural and racial differences in others. I was raised to accept people for their differences and judge people solely on their character.\n\nHowever, I wasn’t aware of the problems encountered by black people in the Deep South during the 1940s. In her novel, Lee makes it apparent that the color of skin was a determinant of social stature, no matter your character. I felt that having a first person narrator, told from the perspective of a young girl in the South was a brilliant way to tell this story. Scout is at the age where she is only beginning to understand how society handles diversity and cultural differences. A black man, Tom Robinson, is accused of raping a white woman, even though none of the evidence points to him. For example, the narrator is a young girl named Scout. Her father, Atticus Finch, is a well-respected, highly moral lawyer who is defending Tom. Even though Atticus finds evidence contrary to the accusations, he has no hope of winning this trial. Scout fights a boy in her class who tells her that her father is defending a “(racial slur)”. Scout now begins to come to terms with her assumptions about people.\n\nAn interesting point is made in this novel. While the white people of this small town in Alabama discuss the horrors of Hitler persecuting Jewish people, Scout wonders how the same people could not understand that the white people of her town were doing the same to the blacks. This sends a powerful message to the reader through such a vivid analogy.\n\nThis novel elicits the reader to think about race relations and social bigotry. There are decent, moral black characters in this novel that are doomed because of their skin color. However, Lee portrays low class white families, such as Bob’s, undeserving of respect, but able to live on a much higher social stature than the blacks. When Tom Robinson is killed escaping from prison, the town barely takes notice.\n\nThrough Lee’s novel, society is faced with the vulgarities of race and social class, along with the racism of this Southern town. Her message that neither race nor class, but actions, define someone’s character leave the reader with important social issues to be re-examined.###"}
{"prompt": "The theme of a literary piece is the central idea or message that it delivers. Cite a specific literary work and discuss the theme.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Theme is the underlying message an author presents to his or her audience. Many times the theme of a work is apparent. Often we ask ourselves upon completing a novel, “What did that character learn at the end?” We base our judgment of characters on our cultural beliefs and emotions we experience in our lives. In Herman Hesse’s Siddartha, the theme seems apparent—fulfillment in life through spiritual peace.\n\nThe main character, Siddartha, takes the reader on his life’s journey to find truth and meaning in life. He decides to leave home with his childhood friend, Govinda. The setting of this story is India, with the social caste system as the motivation for his journey. Siddartha realizes that he yearns for more knowledge and understanding; far more that his father can provide him with. He seeks spiritual fulfillment and wisdom. Even though this story is set in India, the theme is universal. Just as many of us decide to go on to college to learn more about the world, and ourselves; Siddartha does the same.\n\nAt different stages of his journey he acquires wisdom, learns as much as he can, and forges on to new experiences. Siddartha is not unlike a person today in our culture. Many of us challenge ourselves with new ideas and experiences. Sometimes we fail, other times we succeed. However, what unifies us is the desire to explore the unknown. The trade-off is we may discover we are much happier after taking those risks, than if we never ventured out. This is the theme in Siddartha. It is the message that is universal. In fact, there is a very popular book out now about moving cheese. It is a metaphor for the same theme as in Siddartha. Moving out of our comfort zones into a new, unfamiliar arena, hoping to find what it is we are looking for.\n\nSiddartha goes through both pleasant and unpleasant experiences in this novel. At one point, he acquires incredible wealth and has every material possession he could ever dream of. However, at this point in his life, he contemplates suicide! He has become so gluttonous that he sickens himself. He realizes material possessions cannot bring him peace. From this scene, the theme of attaining spiritual peace is strengthened. How many times have we come across people with enormous wealth, but little peace and fulfillment in their lives?\n\nSiddartha is a great novel and its theme is apparent. The quest for spiritual peace, wisdom, and self-understanding is unpredictable, but attainable through the trials of life and what it has to offer.###"}

With this heightened security comes the forfeiture of some civil liberties that George Orwell wrote about in his novel 1984.\n\nIn his novel, Orwell was writing from the perspective of nation that recently endured a world war. Orwell wrote his novel in 1948, and simply rotated the last two digits in the year to explore what the world might be like in the future. In this world that Orwell writes about, the government has surveillance in every imaginable public space. There is also a law enforcement collaborative called the “thought police.” In this society, no one could have anti-governmental sentiment whether vocalized or internalized. If you violated this law, “Big Brother” took you away. This government, (Big Brother), supposedly gave the citizens what they needed in order to survive. In this cold, mundane society, there was always a camera somewhere watching you. I think it is appropriate to assume that this society was under Communist rule, and Orwell was indeed frightening his readers to the thought of such a threat. This threat was very significant in the times this novel was written. Orwell was conveying the themes of manipulation of the truth and loss of identity. In our present day society, there are many parallels to Orwell’s novel.\n\nSince September 11th, our government has taken steps in order to tighten security and minimize terrorist attacks. By the same token, members of our society must forfeit certain civil liberties. For example, if you travel by air now, you must arrive extremely early before departure, your belongings are scrutinized more closely, and you may have to be patted down or asked to remove your shoes. These actions seem to be intrusive, but most people will accept them to ensure safety.\n\nFurthermore, it is becoming commonplace to find video cameras in many public arenas. Many airports, stores, and offices install cameras for surveillance. Technology has produced cameras that are so small, they can be installed in a shirt or jacket button. Many parents install cameras in their homes to monitor activity if they must leave and hire a sitter. Many police vehicles are equipped with video recorders so that the tape might yield evidence in court. There are even popular television shows that air actual surveillance tapes. This is eerily reminiscent of what occurs in Orwell’s 1984.\n\nAlthough we have no thought police, nor do we live under totalitarian rule, our society has definitely surrendered its privacy in order to protect its freedom. Orwell seemed to understand how technology can influence society and its freedoms.###"}
{"prompt": "Personification is the technique wherein a non-human character is given human thoughts, feelings, and dialogue. Illustrate how this technique is used in your favorite novel or short story.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Personification is a clever technique wherein non-human characters are given human characteristics. Using this technique, the reader is able to understand how an animal feels, or what a tree is thinking, or even the most intimate thoughts of an old pair of sneakers! Rudyard Kipling’s “RikkiTikki-Tavi” is one of my favorite short stories. In it, all of the animals are personified, which is crucial because the protagonist is a mongoose.\n\nRikki-Tikki-Tavi is a small mongoose who nearly drowns after a flood sweeps him away from his home. A boy named Teddy finds the mongoose, and he and his mother nurse the animal back to health. Rikki never converses in English with his human family, however he does interact with the other animals in the garden, speaking in English. I find this technique to be helpful in formulating the plot. For example, a mongoose’s natural enemy is the cobra. Kipling uses these two enemies in the wild and makes them the protagonist and antagonist of the short story. Throughout the story, RikkiTikki finds himself battling adversaries in the garden in an effort to save Teddy’s family.\n\nThis story follows the archetype of the battle between good and evil. If we look closely at the plot, biblical themes are apparent. Snakes in the garden may remind some of the biblical story of Adam and Eve. Without personification in this biblical story, Eve might not have been tempted if the serpent didn’t have the ability to speak. Although Rikki-Tikki cannot converse with the humans in the story, the reader is able to understand his character and his thoughts. For example, before he battles Nag, the male antagonist serpent, he is cautious and a bit nervous. However, he won’t show his fear to his enemy. Only the reader understands Rikki’s character from this point of view.\n\nRudyard Kipling was clever enough to observe what occurs in nature, blending it with personification, and creating a timeless story of good versus evil.###"}
{"prompt": "Many times in Shakespeare’s plays, the setting changes from rural or pastoral to urban. Compare and contrast these settings. Explain the reason for the shift of scenery, using support from specific plays.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Many times in Shakespeare’s works, the setting changes from a city to a pastoral venue. Although change in setting is expected, there is an underlying reason why he chooses these specific areas. In his play A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the setting changes from the city of Athens to a forest near the city. The characters behave very differently in each setting.\n\nThe play deals with marriages, love, family, and non-conformity. The Duke of Athens is about to be married to a woman who he recently defeated in war. Another element of the plot deals with a young woman whose father is demanding she marry a man she is not in love with. The woman decides to run away to the forest with the man she does love. There are two distinct settings here and I believe Shakespeare was mirroring human nature in the change of scenery. Often when someone is faced with a pressing problem or decision, they will retreat either physically to a quiet place to meditate, or they might go out with friends in order to take release from the issue or problem. Similarly in this play, the forest is viewed as a place of “nonreality,” or a dream world. Fairies and supernatural beings inhabit the forest. This is a place of refuge that contrasts the conformity of the city. There are, however, similarities in both settings.\n\nJust as the Duke of Athens is marrying Hippolyta, there is King Oberon and his queen in the forest. Both couples are learning about the trials of love. There are colorful characters in both venues that keep the audience entertained also. One such character who lives in the forest is Puck. Puck is a fairy-type character who plays tricks on the characters and ultimately tries to teach them lessons throughout the play. One of the more famous lines from Shakespeare is found in this work when Puck states, “Oh what fools these mortals be.” There are lessons to be learned in both the city and the forest, but the forest is more of a dream world or an escape from reality.\n\nShakespeare cleverly changes the setting in this play to expose human folly and lends keen insight into human nature.###"}
{"prompt": "A third type of conflict is called character vs. him/herself. This is also referred to as internal conflict, because the character must face self-inflicted fears and problems. Write about this type of conflict, using a piece of literature that you have read.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In many literary works there is a central conflict. Conflict can occur in many ways. There is character versus another character, character versus an outside force like nature, and internal conflict, where a character must battle themselves mentally and emotionally. Often these types of conflicts can occur simultaneously in a literary work. I have chosen to discuss my favorite type of conflict in one of my favorite plays by Shakespeare; Hamlet.\n\nInternal conflict is the most intricate of all the types of conflict. We may read about a character that must physically defend themselves against another character. Also, there are many characters that have to brave the elements and survive in life-threatening situations. For example, Ishmael, the narrator and sole survivor in Herman Melville’s Moby Dick tells the story of the giant white whale. But the most intense is internal conflict. In Shakespeare’s Hamlet, a young prince must battle his conscience.\n\nHamlet, the main character, has recently lost his father. While he is still mourning, his mother marries his father’s brother, Claudius. However, Hamlet’s father’s ghost appears to him and shows him the foul play that surrounded his death. Hamlet learns that his uncle actually murdered his father! This is where internal conflict is most present. In one of the most famous Shakespearian lines, Hamlet ponders, “To be, or not to be . . . ”. Hamlet must now decide whether to take action and avenge his father’s death, or to remain passive. This decision weighs so heavily on his conscience, that others notice a drastic change in his behavior. Hamlet must decide if being passive is the equivalent of being a coward. Eventually, this play comes to a tragic end, and Hamlet decides to avenge his father’s murder.\n\nI believe that internal conflict works ideally in literature. Of course, Shakespeare presents Hamlet’s internal conflict through soliloquy, and this was performed on stage, but when you are able to read what a person is struggling through, you can more closely relate to the character. Internal conflict conjures up the fears that many of us have in everyday life. Hopefully ours are not as tragic as Hamlets were!###"}
{"prompt": "Discuss a piece of literature in which the author is also the narrator. Describe the way he or she uses actual events from his or her life in his or her writing.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In literature, there are varying points of view in relaying the events. If the narrator was actually part of the events, this is called first-person narration. When the narrator is merely telling a story, but was not part of the events, this is third-person narration. At times, a reader might be thankful that the narrator is only telling a story as the events unfold, especially if the main characters are in some sort of danger. I personally enjoy first-person narration because you are allowed into the mind of the main character. This was especially enjoyable while reading J.D. Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye.\n\nThe main character, Holden Caufield, is the narrator as well. He is a very complex character who doesn’t seem to fit in socially. Salinger creates the world from Holden’s point of view. Although Holden seems apathetic towards many things in his life such as his schoolwork and friends, he is a deeply sensitive character marred by his view of the world. For example, in the beginning of the novel, Holden questions why his roommates are so popular and can converse so well, especially with members of the opposite sex. His insecurities are revealed so that the reader can explore his character and perhaps identify with him. If Salinger had written this as a third-person narration, the reader might not understand Holden’s character as well.\n\nEven though Holden Caufield is a tragic character, and many of his actions are not the most beneficial, Salinger allows us to identify with Holden’s insecurities and private dealings, many of which the reader might identify with.###"}
{"prompt": "The coming of age theme is very popular in literature. This term refers to a pre-adolescent boy or girl going through many difficult, life altering experiences in order to reach young adulthood. Using a novel you are familiar with, discuss this theme. Be sure to use supporting details and evidence in your essay.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The theme “coming of age” is a common one, where an adolescent boy or girl is faced with decisions that ultimately lead them into adulthood. Barn Burning, by William Faulkner, embodies this theme with messages of family loyalty and morality.\n\nThe story is set in the South, roughly thirty years after the Civil War. The main character who comes of age is Sarty Snopes, an adolescent whose father, Ab Snopes is a poor sharecropper frustrated by the post-Civil War Aristocracy. Sarty’s father is a very destructive, immoral character. In the South at this time, if a person wanted to deliver the most potent form of revenge against their neighbor, they would have someone burn their barn down. This crude assault makes perfect sense considering the main income providing lot was agriculture and livestock. If a person lost their barn where these things were stored, their lives would ultimately be ruined. Ab and his son drift from place to place, and Ab makes money as a hired “hit” for barns. His son is deeply troubled by his father’s destructiveness, but follows along out of “blood,” or the loyalty of family regardless of the activities.\n\nThroughout the novel, Sarty is faced with internal conflict. He knows that his father is doing something highly illegal and immoral; however, he wishes to remain loyal to family. Faulkner explores this coming of age theme with real depth and conviction, as the boy struggles with his conscience.\n\nThe climax of this novel comes when the boy and his father are taken in by a warm, friendly man who provides the two with meals, lodging, and conversation. Sarty takes a genuine liking to the man; however, he knows that his father plans to burn the man’s barn down. Although he tries to convince his father not to commit this heinous act, Ab takes the boy in the middle of the night towards the barn. Sarty makes the hardest decision of his life and warns the man. In the closing scene, a gunshot is heard and the reader can assume that the father has been caught and killed. Sarty has crossed the threshold of pre-adolescence and has deceived “blood” in order to preserve his morality.\n\nWilliam Faulkner’s Barn Burning is a remarkable story of coming of age, where a boy must make the ultimate decision and thus becomes a man.###"}
{"prompt": "Discuss how the reader might sympathize with the main character in Christopher Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus, even though he sells his soul to the Devil.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The familiar adage about selling one’s soul to the devil conjures up two distinct images—dabbling with the occult and being granted magical gifts.\n\nAlthough most people would not want to or would not dare to cross into such dangerous territory, Dr. John Faustus, the renowned scholar in this Elizabethan tragedy, could not resist.\n\nChristopher Marlowe, author of Dr. Faustus, created a complex character in the play of the same name. This character is tragic, foolish, ambitious, intelligent, and pitied. For all the good and bad traits he has, the audience cannot help but share in Faustus’ regret at the end of the play.\n\nFaustus has mastered many disciplines and is a well-known scholar. However, he yearns for more knowledge beyond the realm of what is offered. Faustus summons the occult and encounters a demon named Mephistopheles, a servant to Lucifer. Faustus makes an offer to give his soul to the devil in exchange for twenty-four years of magic. Mephistopheles tries to dissuade Faustus from such a fate, but Faustus persists until the deal has been made. Once this occurs, Faustus is ready to satisfy his ambitions.\n\nAt this point in the play, the audience—although apprehensive about Faustus’ choice—is just as curious as he was about magic and infinite knowledge. Faustus wants to learn the secrets of the universe. He also wants a wife. Basically, he desires the things that most humans desire, and this is where Marlowe captures the audience’s empathy. We know that what Faustus has done is immoral and tragic, but we want to share in this display of power as he entertains courts by summoning historical spirits. The audience has pity for Faustus when he has bouts with his conscience. For example, at one point he prays desperately to God for forgiveness, but the audience realizes that no matter how desperate or how much he pleads, the devil will make sure the contract is honored. What is particularly powerful at the end of the play is the torment and desperation Faustus experiences as he fights the clock and tries to hold back time. But, the hours and minutes close in on his fate. Colleagues find his body the next day, and the audience realizes that he has been dragged down to hell.\n\nAlthough the audience can blame Faustus for summoning the occult and bringing this tragedy on himself, Marlowe creates such a complex character that he is to be pitied for his choices.###"}
{"prompt": "Discuss a hero in a literary piece that you have read.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In her autobiographical novel, I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, Maya Angelou relates her story as a poor black girl living in racially segregated Stamps, Arkansas. As the story unfolds, she describes relationships with her family and members of the community, her love of reading, her feeling of inequality, the racial prejudice she suffers, and her experiences as a single mother. What makes Angelou heroic, I think, is her perseverance over a multitude of odds.\n\nIn the beginning of the novel, the reader learns that Angelou is living with her grandmother because her birth mother abandoned her. With no direction or positive influence in her life, a white woman introduced her to “her first white love” – William Shakespeare –who befriended Angelou. Reading became an escape from her reality. In real life, she weathered many hardships on her path to adulthood. What then makes Angelou a hero?\n\nThe archetype of a hero usually involves hardship, struggle, and an arduous journey. When this hero reaches a certain breaking point or climactic scene, a turn of events usually brings about resolution, self-awareness, and peace. This is true in Angelou’s autobiography.\n\nThroughout the novel, racial prejudice is an overriding factor in her life. Even though Angelou documents her struggles against prejudice, lack of a formal education, and personal failure, she comes full circle when her son is born. She embarks on a new self-awareness and peace. There is a heroic quality about a woman who has overcome so many odds.\n\nAlthough Angelou is both author and subject, she embodies the spirit of a heroic character who ultimately prevailed against the odds.###"}
{"prompt": "Write a literary analysis of a Robert Frost poem. Include theme and symbolism in your discussion.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Frost’s comforting, sad, and often poignant poetry is usually filled with metaphors and vivid imagery. Perhaps my favorite Frost poem is “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.” The imagery creates a memorable portrait of the beauty and power of nature.\n\nNear the beginning, the narrator is introduced as a working man, who has stopped to rest: “My little horse must think it queer / To stop without a farmhouse near.” The narrator suggests that his days are mostly spent in labor, moving from place to place. On a whim, he stops riding to watch the “woods fill up with snow.” During this brief moment, the narrator achieves spiritual transcendence and peace as he connects with nature.\n\nThroughout the poem, the narrator’s horse is a symbol of daily labor and the constant struggle of civilization. Taken from the wilds of nature, domesticated, and trained to obey orders, the horse no longer has any appreciation of nature. While the narrator relaxes in the woods, his horse “gives his harness bells a shake / To ask if there is some mistake.” The irony here is that the man becomes even more connected to nature than the once-wild beast he rides.\n\nIt’s important that this event takes place during “The darkest evening of the year” because the darkness allows the narrator to be hidden from the civilized and unnatural world he lives in every day. At the same time, the darkness of the evening is ironic because the narrator can’t really see the beauty of the woods very clearly. In this way, Frost suggests that nature’s beauty is more than just visual. It’s spiritual too. In the “lovely, dark and deep” woods, the narrator is able to fully appreciate the beauty of nature without seeing it.\n\nAfter his brief moment of peace, the narrator must return to the working world. The line, “And miles to go before I sleep” is repeated at the end to show how weary and tired the narrator has become. Here, the “miles” represent long spans of time. He has a long time to wait before he gets home that night, and he also has a long time to wait before he reaches the ultimate sleep of death. But in this poem, the idea of death isn’t negative because when the narrator dies, he will finally be permanently reunited with the beauty of nature.###"}
{"prompt": "Compare the society of The Scarlet Letter to our society today. Compare and contrast how Hester Prynne would have been treated today with how she was treated in the novel.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Hester Prynne, from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, would not necessarily have fared much better today than in her own time. Some of the Puritanical influences in Salem, Massachusetts at that time still exist in modern society. Public ridicule remains an integral part of our culture, infidelity is still deplored, and unfortunately, women are still often seen as the more guilty party of any extramarital affair.\n\nIn The Scarlet Letter, Reverend Dimmsdale is a spiritual leader of the community. However, he impregnates a young woman named Hester Prynne, who believes her husband has died at sea. As a result of their affair, Hester is forced to wear a scarlet “A” on her chest and stand in the midst of the town on a scaffold. Meanwhile, Dimmsdale keeps his distance and remains silent out of fear. In modern times, it would be hard to imagine anyone who has had an affair being forced to wear a red letter on his or her clothes for all to see, but, at the same time, public ridicule has become a part of modern culture as well. Celebrities are publically ridiculed on the covers of tabloid magazines every day, and the details of their private lives are frequently broadcast on shows like Access Hollywood. In our society, extramarital affairs have become public knowledge. From celebrities to politicians, one way or another, affairs make news and sell papers.\n\nAlso, in the book, Hester Prynne is unfairly singled out as the guilty one as a result of Dimmesdale’s silence. Even now, it is often the woman who is viewed as the immoral one with poor judgment. Although Dimmesdale finally delivers a powerful sermon toward the end of the novel, confessing to the affair before his congregation, he dies—rather conveniently—shortly after, thereby escaping any punishment or public ridicule. So, in the end, Hester Prynne may not have been treated much better in our times. For its portrayal of this timeless situation, The Scarlet Letter remains a viable novel.###"}
