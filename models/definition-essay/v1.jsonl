{"prompt": "What are the main sources of gluten?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Gluten is often the scare of dieters. It is recommended almost universally to cut back on gluten and sugars when trying to lose weight. What is so fattening about them and what exactly is gluten anyway? Gluten is a type of protein found in many types of foods, but mostly those in grains. This substance makes sure these grains maintain their shape and holds food together. Glutens commonly are present in wheat, barley, rye, tritacle, and oats. In the following paragraphs, more detail will be given about the exact foods that has gluten and the components of this material.\n\nGluten in fact contains two types of proteins. According to Medical News Today, “The two main proteins in gluten are glutenin and gliadin. Gliadin is responsible for most of the negative health effects” (Adda Bjarnadottir, MS). Glutenin is responsible for dough elasticity, and is characterized by being of both high molecular weight and low molecular weight units (Anjum, F M, et al). Giladin, on the other hand, “…defines a group of proteins extracted from gluten by 70% ethanol. All fractions have remarkably low solubility in aqueous solution except at extreme pH (Elzoghby et al., 2012b). This low water solubility has been attributed to the presence of disulfide bonds and to the cooperative hydrophobic interactions, which cause the protein chains to assume a folded shape” (“Advances in Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology”). In other words, gliadin is the main component of gluten that makes bread rise.\n\nThe main food gluten is found in is wheat. This refers to foods such as breads, baked goods, soups, pasta, cereals, sauces, salad dressings, and roux (“What Is Gluten?”). Finding a way to avoid these is not easy, but it can be done. Wheat is a traditional food in most cultures, and getting away from these traditions takes the careful checking of food labels and vying for special choices.\n\nThe next most common place to find gluten is in barley. Barley is in malt (malted barley flour, malted milk and milkshakes, malt extract, malt syrup, malt flavoring, malt vinegar), food coloring, soups, beer, and Brewer’s Yeast (“What Is Gluten?”). These are a bit easier to avoid than types of wheat. However, variations of barley are found in many foods as well.\n\nThe third most common food that has gluten proteins is rye. Rye bread (for example, pumpernickel), rye beer, and cereals are usual choices for this substance  (“What Is Gluten?”). Some countries eat more rye than others, but it is still a common group of gluten containers.\n\nYou may not have heard of triticale, but it is also another source of gluten. According to the Celiac Disease Foundation, “Triticale is a newer grain, specifically grown to have a similar quality as wheat, while being tolerant to a variety of growing conditions like rye. It can potentially be found in: breads, pasta, cereals” (“What Is Gluten?”). Basically, it is a laboratory-made hybrid of wheat and rye.\n\nLastly, oats have a presence of gluten. Pure oats are gluten-free, but in these modern times, they are usually in contact with gluten or contaminated in someway. Commonly, oats are grown side by side with wheat and rye. This proximity allows oats that we buy at supermarkets and grocery stores to contain gluten. When purchasing oats, you have to check whether they are gluten-free or not in order to be sure of their pure nature (“The Oat Conundrum: Are Oats Gluten-Free?”).\n\nGluten is a term that refers to an element in many foods that comprises two proteins: glutenin and gliadin. These proteins are linked to weight gain if consumed enough. However, they determine the elasticity and rising of grain, such as wheat, barley, rye, and more. Eating a gluten-free diet is difficult to achieve, so it is usually recommended to only cut down on eating foods with gluten in order to maintain a healthy weight.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the most important type of love?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This is the question that has boggled the minds of philosophers, theologians, scientists, and many more types of people—including the everyday man or woman. Why is this question so difficult to answer? Well, not only are there so many different types of love, defining love is notoriously complex. This essay will focus first on a universal definition of love, and then spread out into the variety of facets this phenomenon entails.\n\nThe word “love” has gone through various dictionary definitions throughout the eons. According to the Harvard Crimson, “The roots of the word “love” can be traced back to the Indo-European root leubh, meaning “to care” or “to desire,” approximated from words including the Latin lubet, “it pleases” and the Sanskrit lubhyati, “he desires.” Along with “love,” related English words like “libido” and “belief” also descend from *lebuh. According to The Bloomsbury Dictionary of Words, while the word “love” initially meant “find pleasing,” it later took on associations with “praise,” “trust” and “belief”’ (Cocola, Jim). This follows a common pattern in romantic relationships that begins with pleasure, progresses to admiration, and finally becomes about trust. We can look at history to see that humanity has considered love to be, in essence, a variety of virtues and feelings. To say one sentence about love is seemingly impossible. That is why is important to differentiate between the types of love we humans experience.\n\nWhat constitutes “pure love” is highly debatable. Religious or spiritual people will say “pure love” is that love which is divinely inspired or related to the divine. Other people will say friendship is the truest love of all. While others will say unconditional love is the only pure form of love. There is no consensus on what constitutes “pure love,” however there are similarities between the definitions. Most ideas about what “pure love” is circles around the concept of something transcendent. This variety of love is commonly above attachment, hate, codependency, and other forms of limitations.\n\nPerhaps the most famous depictions of love in the western world are discussed by Plato, Aristotle, and other historical sources. We can say there are seven flavors of love: romantic love, friendship, familial love, universal love, uncommitted love, practical love, and self-love. Romantic love is marked by passion and sometimes lust between people to create a bond. Love based on friendship, on the other hand, can be said to be shared goodwill, companionship, trust, and more. In a similar vein, familial love is carved out of dependency and familiarity, and is almost automatic. Another type of love that is commonly inbuilt is universal love. This slice of love is based on feeling care for God, strangers, nature, and other encompassing factors. It can also relate to altruism, where we want to help others in need, even if we do not know them well, or do not expect something in return. A more baser type of love is uncommitted love, which involves teasing, flirting, seducing, and sex without attachments. The opposite comes in the form of shared interests and duties with practical love. Often, people are drawn towards each other based on activities, hobbies, professions, and other factors. This can form a strong bond between two or more people at a time. Lastly, self-love is controversial. It can be said to be healthy with self-affirmation and self-confidence, but unhealthy with narcissism and vanity (“These Are the 7 Types of Love”).\n\nAll of these types of loves intermix in our lives. It is difficult to find someone who does not have all these flavors of love present in his or her experience of reality. However, it is up to us to determine the most significant type of love and to search for it. Commonly, figuring out what this most important flavor of love is will indicate what we need to do with our lives, how we need to act, and how we want to construct our family and work lives. Therefore, knowing what love is to you is not only a philosophical pursuit but also a practical one.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the religious significance of Diwali?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As one of the most searched-for questions on Google in 2018, “What is Diwali?” has a simple and not-so-simple answer. Diwali is primarily a Hindu five-day festival that celebrates good triumphing over evil. I say “primarily” because diwali is celebrated in other religions as well, such as Jainism, Sikhism, and Buddhism in some degree. Anyway, in this essay, we will touch upon the holiday’s history, religious significance, and traditions.\n\nThe word itself stems from the Sanskrit word “dīpāvali,” which means “a row of lights.” Diwali is observed every year at the beginning of autumn after the summer harvest, and happens at the same time as the new moon appears and the darkest night in the Hindu lunisolar calendar. The festival begins two days before the new moon, and also goes two after it. The most important day is on the third day, and is the main day referred to as Diwali. This celebration is observed as an official holiday in about 12 countries, with people getting days off from work and other responsibilities (National Portal of India).\n\nThe exact origin of Diwali is not certain, but most scholars say it is a fusion of harvest festivals. The earliest mention of the festival was in Sanskrit texts such as the Padma Purana and the Skanda Purana. Both of these volumes were composed around 700-1000 AD. In addition, the 7th century Sanskrit play Nagananda refers to Diwali, and the 9th century play Kavyamimamsa by Rajasekhara mentions Diwali as well. Besides these texts, this festival of lights has been described by many travelers to India throughout history (Davey, Steve).\n\nIn many countries, Diwali is celebrated as something as important as Christmas to westerners. Mainly observed in India, it has many traditions there. According to National Geographic, “Hindus interpret the Diwali story based upon where they live: In northern India they celebrate the story of King Rama’s return to Ayodhya after he defeated Ravana by lighting rows of clay lamps; southern India celebrates it as the day that Lord Krishna defeated the demon Narakasura; in western India the festival marks the day that Lord Vishnu, the Preserver (one of the main gods of the Hindu trinity) sent the demon King Bali to rule the nether world” (Allen, Calee, et al.). Yet, the common theme among these regional differences is that it celebrates the victory of good over evil.\n\nIn terms of other religions, in Jainism, it marks the enlightenment of the great Mahavira, which happened on October 15, 527 B.C. In terms of Sikhism, Diwali is a celebration of the sixth Sikh guru, Guru Hargobind Ji, who was freed from prison. Also, with a few Buddhists, Diwali is observed as a worship of the goddess Lakshmi. These Buddhists, Newar Buddhists, do not see this as a combination of beliefs, but rather their freedom to worship any deity they desire for their spiritual benefit according to the flexibility of Mahayana Buddhism (Lewis, Todd T.).\n\nAccording to the main practices, there are special things a devotee should do each day of the festival. On the first day, Dhanteras, images of Lakshmi are worshipped. According to the BBC, on this day, “Money is ceremonially purified by washing it in milk, to symbolise the renewal of good intentions towards it and the motivation to use it to benefit family and the greater good. It is also a time for sharing wealth with those one considers deserving and to replace feelings of greed with generosity. This spiritual reinvigoration makes it an auspicious day for buying gold and silver, often jewellery, so this day is also a major shopping day” (BBC News). On the second day, Naraka Chaturdasi, Hindus celebrate Lord Krishna killing the demon Narakasura and rescuing 16,000 princesses. Also, rice is used to make rangoli art. On the third and main day, fireworks are set off and is the last day of the Hindu calendar in many parts of India and abroad. It is said that on this day, Lord Rama slayed the demon Ravana, and rescued his wife, Sita. On this night, lights are lit in windows and around the house. On the fourth day, food is piled high to symbolize the mountain Krisha lifted as a child to protect a village from rain by using the mountain as cover. It also symbolizes the new year. On the final day of Diwali, brothers give gifts to their sisters in order to ensure their well-being and safety (BBC News).\n\nAs Diwali is one of the most popular holidays in the world, it is important to know more about it. It is a day of celebrating the triumph of good over evil, especially in the sense of Lord Krishna and Rama defeating evil doers and securing peace. It is also a festival of fortune, whether it be in terms of finance or spirituality. Practiced by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists, Diwali is observed by over a billion people every year.###"}
{"prompt": "How did Good Friday come to be celebrated?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A holiday observed by many Christian denominations, such as Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Reformed traditions, Good Friday is a day that commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death, and is the Friday before Easter. There are many traditions associated with this holiday, spanning through various denominations. However, in this essay, we will explore the history and culture of this auspicious but somber day.\n\nThough the day has been historically referred to as “good,” meaning “pious,” it is often a time marked with sadness and introspection. Despite misunderstanding, the name is not a variation of “God Friday,” but plainly refers to auspiciousness and righteousness. There are many holidays that contain the adjective “good,” and it refers to days that are holy according to the church (“Who, What, Why: Why Is Good Friday Called Good Friday?”). According to Britannica, “From the early days of Christianity, Good Friday was observed as a day of sorrow, penance, and fasting, a characteristic that finds expression in the German word Karfreitag (“Sorrowful Friday”)” (Hillerbrand, Hans J.). However, the question of when to commemorate Jesus’ crucifixion has been hotly debated for centuries. As Britannica states, “Until the 4th century, Jesus’ Last Supper, his death, and his Resurrection were observed in one single commemoration on the evening before Easter. Since then, those three events have been observed separately—Easter, as the commemoration of Jesus’ Resurrection, being considered the pivotal event” (Hillerbrand, Hans J.). With these variances, the way people celebrated the holiday has also been widely different. However, since Good Friday is not particularly secular in nature, it has not become so widespread as Christmas and Easter.\n\nThough Good Friday is less intense in the modern era in many ways, back in the 4th century, when the commemoration began, it had a more intense nature. It was first recorded by a Spanish nun named Egeria. According to Slate, “Egeria’s description of Holy Week in Jerusalem also includes the first eyewitness account of the practice of venerating the cross—in her case, the “true cross” recently discovered by St. Helena—on Good Friday. Awed by being present for worship on the spot where Jesus had been crucified, Egeria wrote in painstaking detail to her community back home all that she saw going on in what is now the Church of the Holy Sepulchre” (Breyer, Chloe). These diary entries by Egeria became the foundation how Good Friday celebrations. Fasting and even self-harm became traditions following this initial practice.\n\nAs mentioned before, the way Christians observe Good Friday has changed over the years according to each denomination. For instance, the Roman Catholic Church does not observe mass on Good Friday, but public worship is conducted. This liturgy consists of reading the  Passion narrative, adoring the cross, and Holy Communion (though lay people could only partake in Communion since 1955). In addition, from the 17th century, Catholics adopted the Jesuit practice of the Three Hour Service, which is a meditation on “Seven Last Words on the Cross.” In turn, Eastern Orthodox members observe similar traditions but without Communion on Good Friday. More traditions are included, as according to Britannica, “In the Anglican Communion, The Book of Common Prayer similarly provides for a Good Friday reception of the “reserved sacrament,” the consumption of bread and wine that was consecrated the previous day. The Three Hour Service has become common in North American churches, and a variety of liturgical services are held on Good Friday in other Protestant churches. With the revival of a liturgical emphasis in Protestantism in the second half of the 20th century, a distinct trend of adopting Catholic ritual (no use of the organ in the service, draping of the cross, baring of the altar, etc.) developed” (Hillerbrand, Hans J.). As you can see, the melding and mixing of traditions across Christian denominations have taken place, though there are certain differences between each flavor of practice in regard to Good Friday.\n\nGood Friday began to be celebrated in the 4th century, and was first recorded in a diary by a Spanish nun named Egeria. From that early time, from worshipping the cross on the day of the crucifixion of Jesus, it has turned into much more, with fasting, meditation, prayers, Holy Communion, reading of certain Biblical passages, and other liturgy. Despite its worldwide practice, due to its intense religious nature, it has not become as popular to observe as Christmas and Easter, which are more secular in nature.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the definition of green space?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Green space is a term that can mean a vast amount of things. Various disciplines and individuals define it to be various focus points. However, six definitions of green space has been identified through research. The six definitions relate to what is accepted as greenness, examples of green space, ecosystem services, green areas, land use, and vegetated areas.\n\nFirstly, we can look at what is known as “greeness.” In this modern age, this term has acquired such a number of meanings, that is almost impossible to keep track of how it is used (Defining greenspace: Multiple uses across multiple disciplines). According to Almanza et. al., “Greenness describes level of vegetation, ranging from sparsely-landscaped streets to tree-lined walk-ways to playfields and forested parks” (2012). In this sense, one can say which cities or urban areas are more “green” than others. Such cities as Seattle and Kyiv, for example, are often referred to as green cities and sometimes are given special names to this effect like “the evergreen city.”\n\nOftentimes, a definition of something is seen through the lens of examples. Illustrations of what is being meant is commonly the most effective way to understand a concept. As stated by Tavernia et. al, examples of green space are, “combined areas of open land, cropland, urban open land, pasture, forest, and woody perennial” (2009). So, basically, any area that can be given as an example of green space can be become one. The word “combined” is important though, as it creates a holistic view of what green space is.\n\nMore straightforward is that green space comprises ecosystem services. These services usually pertain to how ecological systems can aid human life. According to Aydin et. al., green spaces can be defined as “a type of land use which has notable contributions to urban environments in terms of ecology, aesthetics or public health, but which basically serves human needs and uses” (2012). This can be seen as human-centric green thinking. It is does not have anything to do with environmental conservation.\n\nIn a more general context, green spaces are simply places that look green. That greenness can hark back to a natural sense of living. Stated by S. Gentin in a study on urban forestry and urban greening, “the area investigated included substantial green elements” (2001) when talking about a green space. This cancels out our over-intellectualizing about what we know of as green spaces. Yet, most prefer a more direct definition.\n\nMaybe in reference to Thoreau and other famous wanderers of nature, another way to look at green spaces is that they are generic pieces of land. This pertains more to wild spaces. So, as Boone-Heinonen et. al. say, green space can be described as “recreational or undeveloped land” (2010).\n\nFinally, some specialists in green space say it means a place that features vegetation strongly. This rules out the sense of just something appearing natural or the color itself of green (Heckert, M.).\n\nAs we can see, “green space” means various things to a multitude of specialists. These definitions range from what is perceived as greenness, illustrations of green space, ecosystem services, green areas, untamed land, and places that significantly have the presence of vegetation. So, comprehending what green space is is a messy process, as it depends on which expert you are talking to.###"}
{"prompt": "How has the definition of \"holiday\" changed over time?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The word “holiday” is always pleasant to hear, whether we are participating in one or we are hearing about one from something else. We might think of the term originating from “holy” and “day,” and that is not far from the mark. Below, we will explore the etymology, definitions, and uses of this common word that everyone loves.\n\nThe origin of the term came from Old English when describing the Sabbath. The Sabbath is a period of time of worshiping and remembering God. For the Jewish people, the Sabbath lasts from Friday evening to Saturday evening, whereas it is only on Sunday for Christians. The word is the equivalent of “holy” plus “day,” but in Old English it was written as “hāliġdæġ.” This ancient word is cognate (comes from the same linguistic derivation) with “West Frisian hjeldei (“holiday”), Danish helligdag (“holiday”), Norwegian helligdag (“holiday”), Swedish helgdag (“holiday, feast”)” (Wiktionary). From Old English, it traveled to Middle English in a variety of forms:  halyday, holyday, halidei, haliȝdei. Luckily, in Modern English, we have chosen just one spelling of it.\n\nNow let us move onto the definitions of “holiday.” I always trust Oxford Dictionaries to give me the correct definitions of terms. According to this resource, British people use this noun as “An extended period of leisure and recreation, especially one spent away from home or in travelling.” In America, we usually replace “holiday” with “vacation.” A more specific definition is, “A day of festivity or recreation when no work is done.” It can also be used as a modifier:  “Characteristic of a holiday; festive.” For example, “this is quite the holiday atmosphere.” In its turn, it can also be used with a modifier: “A short period during which the payment of installments, tax, etc. may be suspended.” For instance, “It seems the workers are taking a tax holiday.” In Britain, it can be employed as a verb on occasion: “Spend a holiday in a specified place.” For a look at this slang: “he is holidaying in Cambodia right now” (Oxford Dictionaries). As you can see, over time, the word was associated with the Sabbath, but later turned into a more secular term that is commonly used in work environments.\n\nThere are so many different types of holidays and holidays themselves that it would be difficult to count them all. However, holidays can be broken down into winter holidays, national holidays, international secular observances, unofficial holidays, and religious holidays. For examples of winter holidays, one can name Thanksgiving and New Year’s Eve. In fact, from the period of November until the new year, it is known to be the holiday season. In terms of national holidays, each country, republic, and nation has its own holidays based on what its government proclaims as a day of celebration. Independence days are commonly celebrated in every country, for instance. Some examples of international secular observances are days marked on the United Nations Calendar of Observances, such as commemorating World War II veterans and International Women’s Day. Unofficial holidays have become increasingly popular as well. Arbitrary holidays seem to pop up on social media all the time. There might be holidays celebrating monkeys, cucumbers, guns, and what have you. It all depends on organizations, groups, and other platforms that want to make their own holidays. Some holidays such as April Fool’s Day are popular forms of unofficial holidays that have caught on through the generations. But perhaps the most prominent number of holidays come from religious organizations. There are so many religious holidays within each faction of spiritual belief that it would take lifetimes to count them all and to understand them. Though Christian holidays are some of the most famous (Christmas, for instance), there are also plenty of Islamic, Judaist, Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu holidays that could fill encyclopedias. The Hindu religion alone has hundreds of holiday traditions, based on each of their hundreds of gods. This is not to mention the many minor religious groups and spiritual practices that have their own holidays and observances. Even more mind boggling is when people are from interfaith organizations, and they will celebrate holidays from multiple religions at a time.\n\nTaking all this information in, we can say succinctly that “holiday” derives from Old English and moved onto Middle English, until it landed into modern usage. The definition of the term transferred from being associated with the Sabbath and became connected with vacations from work and school. Additionally, there are thousands of national, international, unofficial, and religious holidays one can talk about. All this discussion has led me to one thing: I think it is time for me to take my own holiday.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the origins and definitions of the word \"philosophy\"?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Philosophy is usually used in a grandiose sense. To philosophize is something that sets us apart from other animals, it seems. If we wonder about our place in the universe, why we exist, and other conundrums, we can be said to be delving into philosophy. Anyone can be a philosopher—especially nowadays with a vast amount of online information at our disposal and our ever-growing inclination as a species to be inquisitive. This is all well and good, but what are the exact origins of the word, the precise definitions of the term, and its many categories? We will explore this question in the following paragraphs.\n\nWell, in English, the word we have today stems from Ancient Greek. The ancient Greek word φιλοσοφία (philosophía) comes from φίλος (phílos, “loving”) plus σοφία (sophía, “wisdom”). The basis of western philosophy originates from Greek philosopher Socrates, so this should not be such a surprise. This Greek term could infer that you love wisdom, or there is a loving wisdom. The word eventually was grabbed by Latin as “philosophia.” From Latin, it moved onto Old French as “philosophie,” and Middle English used it as well with the same spelling. Modern English adapted the spelling, but not much else (Wiktionary).\n\nNow, let us take a look at the various definitions “philosophy” has obtained over the eons. The most trustworthy dictionary out there is the Oxford Dictionary, so we will use it for this essay. “Philosophy” is employed only as a noun. As a mass noun, it means, “The study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, especially when considered as an academic discipline.” When it is in its form as a count noun, it denotes, “A particular system of philosophical thought.” In a more general sense, it is, “The study of the theoretical basis of a particular branch of knowledge or experience.” In a more social and casual context, it is defined as, “A theory or attitude that acts as a guiding principle for behaviour” (Oxford Dictionaries). As you can see, the definitions are fairly clear cut for something that is notably difficult to talk about.\n\nHowever, looking at the origins and definitions of “philosophy” is only touching the surface of understanding this term. In order to fully grasp what philosophy is about, we need to look at how this discipline is categorized. There are five major branches of philosophy: metaphysics and epistemology, value theory, science/logic/mathematics, the history of western philosophy, and philosophical traditions. I will give a rundown of these five branches. With metaphysics, people study the basics of existence, like time, objects, causation, and more. This is linked to epistemology, as it is the study of knowledge itself. Moving onto value theory, it is the discussion of values such as beauty, goodness, and justice, which incorporates ethics, aesthetics, the philosophy of law, and so on. In relation to science, logic, and mathematics, Richard Feynman, a prominent American theoretical physicist, said that the “philosophy of science is as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds.” In this respect, philosophy is often the basis and the result of many disciplines (Carnap, Rudolf). Philosophy is also intertwined with history. In fact, most philosophers specialize in studying in one time period and its relation to philosophy. Also, there are tons of philosophical schools and traditions within varying religions, spiritual sects, and even educational institutions. Philosophy is such a wide topic that it might take a philosopher to understand its reach.\n\nTaking all of this information in, we can say with certainty that defining “philosophy” is kind of philosophical in itself. Though the origins of the word are clear, and the official definitions of the term are not obscure, the ways in which philosophy is viewed by various disciplines and how it interacts with different studies is incredible in its reach. In fact, we can say that philosophy is in every study—if not just a bit.###"}
{"prompt": "How has the definition of \"heat\" changed over time?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " “Heat” is a loaded word. It crosses with physics, slang, everyday language, and more. As a term, “heat” is fairly old and diverse across different languages. In the following paragraphs, we will explore its many definitions, its etymology, and some of the everyday phrases it is used in.\n\nThe word “heat” can be used as a noun or a verb. In its form as a noun, it can mean, “The quality of being hot; high temperature” (Oxford Dictionaries). However, this meaning can be broken down into different areas of interest. In physics, “Heat seen as a form of energy arising from the random motion of the molecules of bodies, which may be transferred by conduction, convection, or radiation,” in meteorology as “Hot weather conditions,” in a culinary sense with “A source or level of heat for cooking,” in terms of spice as “A spicy quality in food that produces a burning sensation in the mouth,” a technical explanation like “The amount of heat that is needed to cause a specific process or is evolved in such a process” and “A single operation of heating something, especially metal in a furnace,” and even emotion: “Intensity of feeling, especially of anger or excitement” (Oxford Dictionaries). The word “heat” does not give up there in the definition department. As a verb, it stands as, “Make or become hot or warm.” This verb can be separated into three categories as well: “(heat up) [no object] (of a person) become excited or impassioned,” “(heat up) [no object] Become more intense and exciting,” and “(archaic) [with object] Inflame; excite” (Oxford Dictionaries). As you can see, though we think of “heat” as a simple word, it can be perceived in a variety of ways.\n\nNow that we know the holistic view of its definition, let us look at where the word came from. The linguistic genealogy of “heat” began with the Proto-Indo European word “kayd,” which is a derived form of the word “kay.” It also meant heat or hot. “Kayd” travelled to Proto-Germanic as “hait,” which meant simply heat. But it became more complicated when it landed in Old English as hǣte, as it had the meaning of heat, warmth, fervor, and ardor. A word with the same definition transferred to Middle English as “hete” (Wiktionary). From “kayd” to “hete,” you can see how the sound was somewhat retained, but the definitions aligned with it started off being fairly simple, got simpler, but along the way became complicated as Old English tagged more meanings onto it.\n\n“Heat” is not just a technical word, but it is also used in common phrases often. One such phrase is, “If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.” Basically, it is saying that if you cannot stand the pressures of a situation, it is better that you don’t take it on. It is usually used when someone is complaining about a circumstance. Another popular phrase involving “heat” is, “in the heat of the moment.” It denotes doing something when angry, upset, or engrossed. It can refer to violence, something spoken, or a sexual act. Also, there is “on heat” or “in heat.” The first is the British way of going about it, and the second is the American style of saying it. It refers to when a female mammal is in the receptive period of her sexual cycle. Dipping into the ebonics dictionary, “heat” commonly means a weapon, especially a gun. Finally, “heat” can mean the intenseness or power of something; an example sentence of this concept is, “Matt is taking the heat for what David did.” The word “heat” is often used in hip hop and rap songs, and its definition in terms of slang is constantly evolving.\n\nThe term “heat” has many definitions as a noun and verb in its present form, and has gone through an arch of evolution. It began as a Proto-Indo European word, and gradually moved into Middle English, with most of its complexity being integrated into its definition within Old English. In terms of its common uses and slang, there are several main phrases “heat” is used in, and in slang, “heat” is employed in a variety of ways, especially in popular music.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the definition of a student?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The word “student” is common not only in English, but also in Afrikaans, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Latin, Lower Sorbian, Norwegian Bokmål, Norwegian Nynorsk, Polish, Romanian, Serbo-Croatian, Swedish, and Tatar. As you can see, this word has a rich history all over the world. For the purpose of this essay, however, we will focus on its English definitions, etymology and concepts aligned with it. Let us say that we will become a student of the word “student.”\n\nOxford Dictionary is usually the go-to resource for definitions. Therefore, let us look at what this esteemed dictionary says about “student.” As a noun, it means, “A person who is studying at a university or other place of higher education,” with some variations such as “A school pupil” and “A person who takes an interest in a particular subject” (Oxford Dictionaries). As a modifier, the word is “Denoting someone who is studying in order to enter a particular profession” (Oxford Dictionaries). As you might have noticed, the term is broad, and becoming a student is a rather easy thing to do. All we need to do is say that we are studying a certain subject.\n\nNow, we will start digging into how the word was formed. It all began with the Latin word  studens, which was a present participle of the word studere (to study). This term eventually moved onto Old French in the form of estudiant, which literally means “student” in the way we know it now. So, basically, it began as a present participle, and became a noun all of its own (Wiktionary).\n\nThe term “student” has been notoriously hard to define even though it is such a commonly used word. This is because no one can actually master a subject, so we are continuously students. We cannot reach the limit of any subject, as knowledge is not only expanding, but it is also seemingly infinite—even computers cannot process all the information available at any present time. This means we can never claim to be outside of “studenthood,” despite our accolades, degrees, and status within a certain discipline. This makes even the most highly recognized person within a particular field a student. They are on equal terms with people learning within educational institutions. However, it may be said they have achieved a certain level of knowledge—though mastery cannot be accurately claimed. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “Do you know the secret of the true scholar? In every man there is something wherein I may learn of him; and in that I am his pupil.”\n\nAlso, being a student implies a certain humility. If you have a large ego, it would be difficult for you to be considered a student. In order to study and to learn, you have to be able to accept, absorb, and integrate new information in your brain. The know-it-alls of this world are often not seen as students, even if they are enrolled in a university.\n\nEven teachers can be considered students. Teachers often say they learn from their students in the subject they know best. In addition, teachers are known to continually study and innovate within their discipline. This means they are in a sense students too.\n\nThe act of curiosity is sometimes cited as a way of being a student. As American author Og Mandino said, “Take the attitude of a student, never be too big to ask questions, never know too much to learn something new.” Many issues arise in this world because of narrow mindedness, and being a student is seen as being beneficial for one’s character and society as a whole. What is a student if not someone who is curious about life and how it works?\n\nThe term “student” is usually defined as someone who studies in any shape or form. The word can be employed as a noun or a modifier, but began as a present participle in Latin, where it moved onto Old French as a noun. However, “student” can also be used as a philosophical term denoting curiosity, humbleness, and the acceptance of the vastness of knowledge.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the different implications of the word \"fashion\"?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The fashion industry has been “fashionable” since the Industrial Revolution, but clothing fashion has been around since humans have existed. Technically, fashion can be used as a noun or a verb. As a noun, we can see it all around us in the choices people make with their clothing and the ideas they inject into their clothing designs. As a verb, we can witness objects, ideas, and other phenomena being fashioned, or created. Not surprisingly, the word “fashion” does have a link to the French language, but it is more complicated than that. In the following paragraphs, I will explain about the etymology of “fashion” and also the different implications of the word.\n\nInitially, we can look at the etymology of “fashion.” The progression of the word “fashion” stretches fairly far back in time. Its first variant was in Latin with “factiō” (“a making”), which was originally derived from “faciō” (to make). So, it was first a verb, then a noun in Latin. Eventually, it moved onto Old French as three variants: faceon, fazon, façon. These three words have various meanings, such as fashion, form, make, and outward appearance. However, it got simplified in Old Northern French when it became just “fechoun” which means a fashion or a way. The same word travelled to Anglo-Norman, and eventually ended up in Middle English as “facioun.” At present, “fashion” is an internationally accepted word that most languages integrate into their system (Wiktionary).\n\nAs mentioned before, “fashion” is employed as a noun and as a verb. It has two meanings as a noun: “A popular or the latest style of clothing, hair, decoration, or behaviour,” and “A manner of doing something” (Oxford Dictionaries). In its verbal form, it has one meaning, “Make into a particular form,” but also it being used as phrase, “fashion something into” (Oxford Dictionaries). Yet, these are only the technical definitions of “fashion,” and the word relates to many different areas of life.\n\nFashion consequently relates to trends. These trends are often connected to the fashion industry, clothing fashions, political influences, technological influences, social influences, economic influences, and consumers’ needs. Clothing fashions have developed from necessity and traditions, whereas the fashion industry was built on novelty. Relating to this, PBS states that, “One certain thing in the fashion world is change. We are constantly being bombarded with new fashion ideas from music, videos, books, and television. Movies also have a big impact on what people wear. Ray-Ban sold more sunglasses after the movie Men In Black. Sometimes a trend is world-wide. Back in the 1950s, teenagers everywhere dressed like Elvis Presley” (PBS). The fashion industry grew out of the Industrial Revolution in France, but clothing fashion has existed for as long as humankind has been around. Fashion trends are often connected to politics. For example, whatever public figures wear, especially governmental public figures, is often reported in the news and commented on by fashion analysts. In addition, technology plays a part in fashion by producing countless wearable gadgets, and also the way fashion shows are presented. The social influence on fashion is enormous, with famous people in the media constantly affecting how fashion trends turn. Economics can also affect fashion, as downturns and upturns in an economy can sway what people wear and what clothing they purchase. Finally consumer’s needs affect fashion, as not only is the consumer the driving force behind innovation in fashion (since they buy clothes from designers and allow the designer’s careers to stay afloat), the consumer also usually vies for comfort and practicality when purchasing clothing. There are exceptions when people buy certain clothing for style, but the vast majority of clothing is bought on the basis of it being suitable for everyday situations (Suttle, Rick).\n\nFashion as a word began to form in Latin, went to Old French, Old Northern French, Anglo-Norman, and came conclusively to Middle English. It is seen now as both a noun and a verb, and is affected by politics, economics, society, technology, and consumer’s needs. The meaning of fashion has been firmly planted since the Industrial Revolution, and it looks like it will not change its meaning anytime soon.###"}
{"prompt": "How has the definition of \"health\" changed over time?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The word “health” seems to be straightforward. However, each word has a history and nuances in definition, and the word “health” is no exception. Health can be spoken about in terms of biology, wellbeing, and personal satisfaction. In the following paragraphs, we will explore the etymology of the word “health” and how the word relates to various disciplines.\n\nThere are two theories of the progression of this word. Firstly, it is thought that “health” as a term derives from the Proto-Germanic word “haliþaz,” man or hero. Later, with Old English, the word transformed into “hæleþ,”  with the meaning of man, hero, or fighter. Finally, in Middle English, the word became “haleth,” which has the same definition as in Old English. According to another form of etymology for “health,” the word came from the Proto-Germanic term “haliaz,” which is defined as whole or hale. This transferred to the West Proto-Germanic language as “hailiþō,” “hǣlþ” in Old English, and “healthe” in Middle English—all with the same meaning. According to the first theory, “health” is “Cognate with West Frisian held (“hero”), Dutch held (“hero”), German Held (“hero”), Danish helt (“hero”), Swedish hjälte (“hero”), Norwegian hold (“hero”) (Wiktionary). As you can see, the progression of the word “health” is a bit muddled, and not exactly linear in meaning.\n\nHowever, in modern English, it is understood to be a mass noun referring to “The state of being free from illness or injury,” figuratively as “A person’s mental or physical condition,” and as a saying, with it being “Used to express friendly feelings towards one’s companions before drinking” (Oxford Dictionaries). This is far from the definitions and the contexts it was used in some of etymological theories of its Proto-Germanic, Old English, and Middle English origins.\n\nThough these are standard definitions of “health,” the word also correlates to many disciples. For instance, The World Health Organization in 1948 proposed that health relates to “physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity” (World Health Organization). However, later the Organization revised its definition as, “The extent to which an individual or group is able to realize aspirations and satisfy needs and to change or cope with the environment. Health is a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living; it is a positive concept, emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities” (WHO Regional Office for Europe). It is easily noticed that this pivotal Organization changed its definition to a more holistic statement as time went on.\n\nIn relation to psychology, which focuses more on mental health (which also interacts with our physical system), the word “health” is prominent. According to Psych Central, “Mental health and wellness is the state at which one feels, thinks, and behaves. Mental health can be viewed on a continuum, starting with an individual who is mentally well and free of any impairment in his or her daily life, while someone else might have mild concerns and distress, and another might have a severe mental illness. Mental health is just as vital as physical health” (Psych Central). As you might have noticed, mental health is not so black and white. It is difficult to determine the exact sanity or insanity of a person; however, we can generalize about how a person stands in terms of mental health.\n\n“Health” is a fairly old word, deriving from the Proto-Germanic language, which continued on in Old English and in Middle English. There are two versions of its etymology, but at present there is usually one generalized definition of the word by the World Health Organization. Health encompasses physical, psychological, and social wellbeing.###"}
{"prompt": "How has sexism evolved over time?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " There are many “isms,” and sexisim is one of the most vile ones. It is often talked about in relation to the workplace, positions of power, societal status, and rights. It pertains to prejudice towards a gender for any reason. However, these reasons are usually fueled by ignorance, conditioning of the mind from an early age, or being a part of hate groups. Like racism, it does not look like sexism will go away soon, but hopefully it has declined since ancient times. To understand sexism to a greater degree, let us look at its definitions and history.\n\nThe term “sexism” was coined on November 18, 1965 by Pauline M. Leet at Franklin and Marshall College during a student-teacher forum. Leet gave a speech called “Women and the Undergraduate” in which she compared prejudice against sexes to racism. The key part of the speech by Leet was that, “When you argue … that since fewer women write good poetry this justifies their total exclusion, you are taking a position analogous to that of the racist—I might call you in this case a ‘sexist’ … Both the racist and the sexist are acting as if all that has happened had never happened, and both of them are making decisions and coming to conclusions about someone’s value by referring to factors which are in both cases irrelevant” (Finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com). However, it was not until three years later, on November 15, 1968, that the word “sexism” was seen in print. It was another speech, put in print in Vital Speeches of the Day, called “On Being Born Female” Caroline Bird. Another definition was given of sexism by Bird: “There is recognition abroad that we are in many ways a sexist country. Sexism is judging people by their sex when sex doesn’t matter. Sexism is intended to rhyme with racism” (Finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com).\n\nSexism is a broad term, and has been defined based on various disciplines. Generally, sexism is nowadays defined as the belief that one gender is superior to another. It is also stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination based on gender. Most often, sexism is referring to thinking of women and girls as lesser than their male counterparts (Schaefer, Richard T.).  Within sociology, sexisim is delienated into an individual and institutional levels. Besides at the usual one-to-one level of sexism between people, sexism is said to be perpetuated by social institutions such as colleges, government services, and customs (Schaefer, Richard T.). On the other hand, within psychology, sexisim is seen as negative attitudes and values about certain genders. Psychology also recognizes that there is negative and benevolent stereotypes about different genders (Crawford, Mary). Turning to feminism, sexisim is commonly defined as being a systematic oppression of women that ends in women being disadvantaged. In addition, feminism states that sexism is a complex of male supremacy, misogyny, and chauvinism (Marilyn., Frye). According to ThoughtCo, “Some feminists have argued that sexism is the primal, or first, form of oppression in humanity, and that other oppressions are built on the foundation of oppression of women. Andrea Dworkin, a radical feminist, argued that position: “Sexism is the foundation on which all tyranny is built. Every social form of hierarchy and abuse is modeled on male-over-female domination”’ (Napikoski, Linda). However, feminism is often cited as having a more extreme view on sexism than from sociological and psychological points of perspective.\n\nSexism is a hot topic in many international forums and between people in their day-to-day lives. And there is a good reason for this: sexism has permeated our societal, psychological, and intellectual understanding of genders. Though sexism is generally defined as prejudice against a certain gender, it has many other implications in terms of history, societal impact, and psychological peculiarities.###"}
{"prompt": "How has the definition of terrorism changed since it was first used during the French Revolution?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Terrorism is affecting countless countries in the world right now. The topic is hotly debated and a part of the collective fear of our global society. However, do common people understand exactly what terrorism is and implies? In order to educate readers, we will have a breakdown of what the term “terrorism” means, from the origins of the word and the types of terrorism.\n\nThe word “terrorist,” or terroriste in French, was invented during the French revolution in 1794. Accordingly, the first meaning of the word meantyou were a supporter of the Jacobins (The Guardian). Encyclopedia.com states that, “Jacobins (jăk´əbĬnz), political club of the French Revolution. Formed in 1789 by the Breton deputies to the States-General, it was reconstituted as the Society of Friends of the Constitution after the revolutionary National Assembly moved (Oct., 1789) to Paris. The club derived its popular name from the monastery of the Jacobins (Parisian name of Dominicans), where the members met” (Biodiversity Data Journal). This group of people are often cited for the repressive and violent acts during the Reign of Terror between 1794 and 1794. Oxford Dictionary notes that the word “terrorist” was used a derogatory term for an individual’s character, rather than a word in the context of specific actions (The Guardian).\n\nHowever, there are supposedly 109 definitions of terrorism (Current Directions in Psychological Science). Each nation has different definitions of terrorism according to laws, and the international community rarely finds ways to agree upon a definitive description of terrorism. However, the modern use of the term “terrorism” is different than when it was used in the French Revolution, when it was employed as a derogatory word for those who were oppressive and violent. French historian Sophie Wahnich says this about the difference between French Revolution “terrorists” and those who attacked the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001: “Revolutionary terror is not terrorism. To make a moral equivalence between the Revolution’s year II and September 2001 is historical and philosophical nonsense . . . The violence exercised on 11 September 2001 aimed neither at equality nor liberty” (Wahnich, Sophie). In light of this, modern terrorism can be said to be mass violence, often to enact revenge, or to follow an extremist decree or ideal.\n\nBesides the countless definitions of terrorism, there are also varying types of terrorism. There is civil disorder, political terrorism, non-political terrorism, quasi-terrorism, limited political terrorism, official or state terrorism, domestic terrorism, and international terrorism (Purpura, Phillip).  Civil disorder is collective violence which disturbs the functioning of a community; political terrorism refers to mass violence to a community to achieve political means; non-political terrorism is collective violence by an individual or mass gain; quasi-terrorism is an act that is similar to terrorism, but reaches for different ends, such as a hostage situation started by a felon; limited political terrorism is not aligned with a revolutionary approach, but is still acted upon by ideological motives; official or state terrorism is delineated by governments as committing terror acts in order to pursue political and financial goals; domestic terrorism is terrorism within a country’s boundaries, whereas international terrorism refers to mass violent acts outside of a country’s boundaries. As you can see, there are many different flavors, if you will, of terrorism, besides the 109 definitions of terrorism. This means that not only is terrorism difficult to define, terrorism is seen within the context of a country’s laws.\n\nTerrorism is occurring worldwide, and it is a highly debated issue currently. Though the term “terrorist” began in the French Revolution as a kind of swear word, it became known as an individual who engages in mass violence for a particular end—especially ideological and political ends. However, the definition of terrorism varies within each country based on legislation, and there are also many types of terrorism to consider.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the different types of opinions?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " With so many opinions used in the news, in our personal conversations, and in debates, it is worth knowing more about this word. Though we might think that “opinion” is a one-dimensional word, it has several facets. A opinion can be a judgement, viewpoint, or statement. Commonly, an opinion is not conclusive, and reflects a person’s perception. Therefore, they are windows into a person’s mind. Below, we will delve into some of word’s epistemology, its origins, and different types of opinions, which comprise the word’s varying definitions.\n\nWithin economics, social sciences, and philosophy, there is normative analysis and positive analysis. Normative analysis is based on one’s own opinion, whereas positive analysis is founded on scientific observation. Ancient Greek philosophers, especially Plato, demonstrated the divide between knowledge and opinion. It was shown that opinions can be persuasive, but the assertions that opinions are based on can be duly examined scientifically (Plato’s Analogy of the Divided Line).\n\nNow that we have looked at how the word “opinion” is used in various disciplines, let us look at the history of “opinion.” The word began to be used in Old French around the year 1300. It was spelled the same, and had roughly the same meaning. This word from Old French originated from the Latin word “opinionem,” which meant, “opinion, conjecture, fancy, belief, what one thinks; appreciation, esteem,” from [the] stem of opinari “think, judge, suppose, opine,” from PIE *op- (2) “to choose” (www.etymonline.com).\n\nIn casual use, an opinion means an individual’s perception, desire, and belief. Also, the word “opinion” can be used casually as a way of pointing out that evidence has not substantiated a certain point, but the person would like to express a viewpoint regardless. Sometimes, the word is used as a polite way of saying that one does not know much about a certain subject.\n\nWith public opinion, an opinion becomes an aggregate of many people’s thoughts. It usually reflects what a majority of people in a certain society believe or think. Gathering public opinion is a valuable exercise for politicians, marketers, and researchers.\n\nThere is a term “group opinion” that is used in political science and psychology. A certain group’s opinion is researched in order to ascertain answers to certain questions within particular disciplines. Researchers often want to know how an organizational body thinks and believes as a collective.\n\nScientific opinion is similar to public opinion, but focuses on scientific organizations and institutions. When someone says, “the current scientific opinion on this subject,” he or she is meaning what the general consensus is about a certain topic within the scientific community. However, scientific opinion is often shaky, as a scientific issue can be almost equally divided in perception between organizations (Science). But overall, the scientific community tries to come to a consensus on certain issues so that a formed opinion can be presented to the public.\n\nIf you have watched TV shows about lawyers, you might have heard of a legal opinion. It is an opinion given by an attorney to a client. But these opinions are not given in a casual sense, but more for business transactions. This type of opinion expresses the attorney’s professional view on a legal matter. Though a legal opinion is not a guarantee of any result, a mistaken or incomplete legal opinion can become the grounds for malpractice.\n\nIn the same vein, a judicial opinion is the opinion of a judge or a group of judges. This flavor of opinion explains and/or discusses an order or ruling in court that is controversial. The opinion is given based on facts and principles rather than personal belief. The goal of giving such an opinion is to show the rationale behind the court’s decision (O.S. Kerr).\n\nAn “editorial opinion” is a term employed to state an evaluation of a topic by a newspaper on an editorial page. Like other professional opinions, they are based facts and logic rather than intuitive perceptions.\n\nAs you can see, there are many types of opinions, and many uses for them. Next time you give your opinion about a certain subject, now you can process your thoughts more diligently. Just make sure you use solid logic when forming an opinion that could last with you your entire life.###"}
{"prompt": "How has the meaning of \"zombie\" changed since it was first introduced into English?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The word “zombie” is not as clear cut as one might think. It can infer a fictional, undead creature, a state of stupor, or an act of mindless devotion. The term has been a part of popular culture the world over for over a century. Not only is a zombie an appealing character for horror films, it is often seen as a metaphor for our way of living. In the following paragraphs, I will flesh out the word “zombie” in its intricacies in order for readers to comprehend what this word means to us on a more profound level.\n\nThe English language usage of the word “zombie” first appeared in writing in 1819 when poet Robert Southey was putting together a history of Brazil. He wrote about “zombi,” and was referring to Zumbi, an Afro-Brazilian rebel leader (Radford, Benjamin). Essentially, it is a misprint, but the Oxford English Dictionary tells that the origin of the word “zombie” derives from the Kongo words “nzambi” (god) and “zumbi” (fetish). Also, in Haitian folklore, a zombie or “zonbi” is a corpse raised from the dead, usually by witchcraft (Oxford English Dictionary). How the word “zombie” started to be used in popular western culture is difficult to trace, however with the film Night of the Living Dead (1968), the director George Romero described the creatures in his film as “zombies” in interviews, though there is no direct mention of this term in the film. But with Dawn of the Dead (1978), Romero exclusively used the term “zombie” in the script. These zombies were disconnected from their African roots, unlike the zombies portrayed as early in films such as White Zombie (1932). It is said that with Night of the Living Dead, though, that the word “zombie” became mainstream and “western” (Maçek III, J.C.).\n\nAn informal usage of the word “zombie” in English corresponds to a state of stupor. If you want to say you are extremely tired, you can say, “I feel like a zombie,” or “I’m a zombie right now,” and other such phrases. Whether or not this is tied to the term’s West African roots is unclear, but it is most likely connected to the western interpretation of a zombie devoid of its voodoo history. Often, when someone wants to refer to themselves as a zombie, he or she even puts on an act as if he or she is an actual zombie. Though this infers extreme tiredness, the word “zombie” can mean a mindless devotion as well.\n\nWhen we want to express that people are following the status quo without a bat of an eye, we often use the term “zombie” for these type of individuals. In fact, there are even protest marches or demonstrations where people dress up as zombies. Called “zombie walks,” these events parody political extremism or apathy (Colley, Jenna). The term being used as a metaphor for a citizen’s lifeless state within a government’s clutches is more popular than ever. According to Vox, “For 80 years, the undead have been used by filmmakers and writers as a metaphor for much deeper fears: racial sublimation, atomic destruction, communism, mass contagion, globalism — and, more than anything, each other. Fear, which once compelled us to appropriate the zombie, has also governed the new symbology we’ve given it over the years. This makes the zombie not only a fascinating study of our country’s historical fears but also a window into how foreign ideas adopt new meaning when stripped of their original context over time” (Zarracina, Zachary Crockett and Javier). Like most metaphors, the term “zombie” has transcended its roots, and has become a portrayal of our deepest fears and regrets.\n\nThough the term “zombie” is commonly associated with a fictional creature displayed in films and included in literature, the term “zombie” most likely came from Haitian folklore, and was later appropriated by western culture. Besides a zombie being a fictional creature, people often employ the term to describe themselves as tired, and also as a person who blindly follows authority. I do not know if Haitian witch doctors would be rolling in their graves if they saw what would be happening to their zombies, but it is for definite that zombies have infiltrated western cinema, literature, and language.###"}
{"prompt": "What was the smoking gun that proved atoms were more than mathematical abstractions?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " How would one find out what types of atoms there were? Today, it does not seem like it should have been difficult to work out an experimental program to classify the types of atoms. For each type of atom, there should be a corresponding element, i.e., a pure substance made out of nothing but that type of atom. Atoms are supposed to be unsplittable, so a substance like milk could not possibly be elemental, since churning it vigorously causes it to split up into two separate substances: butter and whey. Similarly, rust could not be an element, because it can be made by combining two substances: iron and oxygen. Despite its apparent reasonableness, no such program was carried out until the eighteenth century.\n\nBy 1900, however, chemists had done a reasonably good job of finding out what the elements were. They also had determined the ratios of the different atoms’ masses fairly accurately. A typical technique would be to measure how many grams of sodium (Na) would combine with one gram of chlorine (Cl) to make salt (NaCl) (this assumes you have already decided, based on other evidence, that salt consisted of equal numbers of Na and Cl atoms). The masses of individual atoms, as opposed to the mass ratios, were known only within a few orders of magnitude based on indirect evidence, and plenty of physicists and chemists denied that individual atoms were anything more than convenient symbols.\n\nThe following table gives the atomic masses of all the elements on a standard scale in which the mass of hydrogen is very close to 1.0. The absolute calibration of the whole scale was only very roughly known for a long time, but was eventually tied down, with the mass of a hydrogen atom being determined to be about 1.7×10−271.7×10−27 kg.\n\nAg	107.9	Eu	152.0	Mo	95.9	Sc	45.0\nAl	27.0	F	19.0	N	14.0	Se	79.0\nAr	39.9	Fe	55.8	Na	23.0	Si	28.1\nAs	74.9	Ga	69.7	Nb	92.9	Sn	118.7\nAu	197.0	Gd	157.2	Nd	144.2	Sr	87.6\nB	10.8	Ge	72.6	Ne	20.2	Ta	180.9\nBa	137.3	H	1.0	Ni	58.7	Tb	158.9\nBe	9.0	He	4.0	O	16.0	Te	127.6\nBi	209.0	Hf	178.5	Os	190.2	Ti	47.9\nBr	79.9	Hg	200.6	P	31.0	Tl	204.4\nC	12.0	Ho	164.9	Pb	207.2	Tm	168.9\nCa	40.1	In	114.8	Pd	106.4	U	238\nCe	140.1	Ir	192.2	Pt	195.1	V	50.9\nCl	35.5	K	39.1	Pr	140.9	W	183.8\nCo	58.9	Kr	83.8	Rb	85.5	Xe	131.3\nCr	52.0	La	138.9	Re	186.2	Y	88.9\nCs	132.9	Li	6.9	Rh	102.9	Yb	173.0\nCu	63.5	Lu	175.0	Ru	101.1	Zn	65.4\nDy	162.5	Mg	24.3	S	32.1	Zr	91.2\nEr	167.3	Mn	54.9	Sb	121.8\n\nAs the information accumulated, the challenge was to find a way of systematizing it; the modern scientist’s aesthetic sense rebels against complication. This hodgepodge of elements was an embarrassment. One contemporary observer, William Crookes, described the elements as extending “before us as stretched the wide Atlantic before the gaze of Columbus, mocking, taunting and murmuring strange riddles, which no man has yet been able to solve.” It was not long before people started recognizing that many atoms’ masses were nearly integer multiples of the mass of hydrogen, the lightest element. A few excitable types began speculating that hydrogen was the basic building block, and that the heavier elements were made of clusters of hydrogen. It was not long, however, before their parade was rained on by more accurate measurements, which showed that not all of the elements had atomic masses that were near integer multiples of hydrogen, and even the ones that were close to being integer multiples were off by one percent or so.\n\nChemistry professor Dmitri Mendeleev, preparing his lectures in 1869, wanted to find some way to organize his knowledge for his students to make it more understandable. He wrote the names of all the elements on cards and began arranging them in different ways on his desk, trying to find an arrangement that would make sense of the muddle. The row-and-column scheme he came up with is essentially our modern periodic table. The columns of the modern version represent groups of elements with similar chemical properties, and each row is more massive than the one above it. Going across each row, this almost always resulted in placing the atoms in sequence by weight as well. What made the system significant was its predictive value. There were three places where Mendeleev had to leave gaps in his checkerboard to keep chemically similar elements in the same column. He predicted that elements would exist to fill these gaps, and extrapolated or interpolated from other elements in the same column to predict their numerical properties, such as masses, boiling points, and densities. Mendeleev’s professional stock skyrocketed when his three elements (later named gallium, scandium, and germanium) were discovered and found to have very nearly the properties he had predicted.\n\nOne thing that Mendeleev’s table made clear was that mass was not the basic property that distinguished atoms of different elements. To make his table work, he had to deviate from ordering the elements strictly by mass. For instance, iodine atoms are lighter than tellurium, but Mendeleev had to put iodine after tellurium so that it would lie in a column with chemically-similar elements.\n\nThe success of the kinetic theory of heat was taken as strong evidence that, in addition to the motion of any object as a whole, there is an invisible type of motion all around us: the random motion of atoms within each object. But many conservatives were not convinced that atoms really existed. Nobody had ever seen one, after all. It was not until generations after the kinetic theory of heat was developed that it was demonstrated conclusively that atoms really existed and that they participated in continuous motion that never died out.\n\nThe smoking gun to prove atoms were more than mathematical abstractions came when some old, obscure observations were reexamined by an unknown Swiss patent clerk named Albert Einstein. A botanist named Brown, using a microscope that was state of the art in 1827, observed tiny grains of pollen in a drop of water on a microscope slide, and found that they jumped around randomly for no apparent reason. Wondering at first if the pollen he had assumed to be dead was actually alive, he tried looking at particles of soot, and found that the soot particles also moved around. The same results would occur with any small grain or particle suspended in a liquid. The phenomenon came to be referred to as Brownian motion, and its existence was filed away as a quaint and thoroughly unimportant fact, really just a nuisance for the microscopist.\n\nIt was not until 1906 that Einstein found the correct interpretation for Brown’s observation: the water molecules were in continuous random motion, and were colliding with the particle all the time, kicking it in random directions. After all the millennia of speculation about atoms, at last there was solid proof. Einstein’s calculations dispelled all doubt, since he was able to make accurate predictions of things like the average distance traveled by the particle in a certain amount of time. Einstein received the Nobel Prize not for his theory of relativity but for his papers on Brownian motion and the photoelectric effect, in fact.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the three most important points about fields of force?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Given that fields of force are real, how do we define, measure, and calculate them? A fruitful metaphor will be the wind patterns experienced by a sailing ship. Wherever the ship goes, it will feel a certain amount of force from the wind, and that force will be in a certain direction. The weather is ever-changing, of course, but for now let us just imagine steady wind patterns. Definitions in physics are operational, i.e., they describe how to measure the thing being defined. The ship’s captain can measure the wind’s “field of force” by going to the location of interest and determining both the direction of the wind and the strength with which it is blowing. Charting all these measurements on a map leads to a depiction of the field of wind force. This is known as the “sea of arrows” method of visualizing a field.\n\nNow let us see how these concepts are applied to the fundamental force fields of the universe. We will start with the gravitational field, which is the easiest to understand. As with the wind patterns, we will start by imagining gravity as a static field, even though the existence of the tides proves there are continual changes in the gravity field in our region of space. Defining the direction of the gravitational field is easy enough: we simply go to the location of interest and measure the direction of the gravitational force on an object, such as a weight tied to the end of a string.\n\nBut how should we define the strength of the gravitational field? Gravitational forces are weaker on the Moon than on Earth, but we cannot specify the strength of gravity by giving a certain number of newtons. The number of newtons of gravitational force depends not just on the strength of the local gravitational field, but also on the mass of the object on which we are testing gravity, our “test mass.” A boulder on the Moon feels a stronger gravitational force than a pebble on Earth. We can get around this problem by defining the strength of the gravitational field as the force acting on an object, divided by the object’s mass.\n\nThe gravitational field vector, gg, at any location in space is found by placing a test mass mtmt at that point. The field vector is then given by g=F/mtg=F/mt, where FF is the gravitational force on the test mass.\n\nThe magnitude of the gravitational field near the surface of Earth is about 9.8 N/kg, and it is no coincidence that this number looks familiar, or that the symbol gg is the same as the one for gravitational acceleration. The force of gravity on a test mass will equal mtgmtg, where gg is the gravitational acceleration. Dividing by mtmt simply gives the gravitational acceleration, though. Why define a new name and new units for the same old quantity? The main reason is that it prepares us with the right approach for defining other fields.\n\nThe most subtle point about all this is that the gravitational field tells us about what forces would be exerted on a test mass by Earth, Sun, Moon, and the rest of the universe, if we inserted a test mass at the point in question. The field still exists at all the places where we did not measure it.\n\nIf we make a sea-of-arrows picture of the gravitational fields surrounding Earth, f, the result is evocative of water going down a drain. For this reason, anything that creates an inward-pointing field around itself is called a sink. Earth is a gravitational sink. The term “source” can refer specifically to things that make outward fields, or it can be used as a more general term for both “outies” and “innies.” However confusing the terminology, we know that gravitational fields are only attractive, so we will never find a region of space with an outward-pointing field pattern.\n\nKnowledge of the field is interchangeable with knowledge of its sources (at least in the case of a static, unchanging field). If aliens saw Earth’s gravitational field pattern they could immediately infer the existence of the planet, and conversely if they knew the mass of Earth, they could predict its influence on the surrounding gravitational field.\n\nAn important fact about all fields of force is that when there is more than one source (or sink), the fields add according to the rules of vector addition. The gravitational field certainly will have this property, since it is defined in terms of the force on a test mass, and forces add like vectors. Superposition is an important characteristics of waves, so the superposition property of fields is consistent with the idea that disturbances can propagate outward as waves in a field.\n\nIn reference to the argument for the existence of energy-bearing ripples in the electric field, we see that nowhere is it necessary to appeal to any specific properties of electrical interaction. We therefore expect energy-carrying gravitational waves to exist, and Einstein’s general theory of relativity does describe such waves and their properties. J.H. Taylor and R.A. Hulse were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1993 for giving indirect evidence to confirm Einstein’s prediction. They discovered a pair of exotic, ultra-dense stars called neutron stars orbiting one another very closely, and showed they were losing orbital energy at the rate predicted by general relativity.\n\nA Caltech-MIT collaboration has built a pair of gravitational wave detectors called LIGO to search for more direct evidence of gravitational waves. Since they are essentially the most sensitive vibration detectors ever made, they are located in quiet rural areas, and signals will be compared between them to make sure that they were not due to passing trucks. The project began operating at full sensitivity in 2005, and is now able to detect a vibration that causes a change of 10−1810−18 m in the distance between the mirrors at the ends of the 4-km vacuum tunnels. This is a thousand times less than the size of an atomic nucleus! There is only enough funding to keep the detectors operating for a few more years, so the physicists can only hope that during that time, somewhere in the universe, a sufficiently violent cataclysm will occur to make a detectable gravitational wave (more accurately, they want the wave to arrive in our solar system during that time, although it will have been produced millions of years before).###"}
{"prompt": "How does voltage relate to the flow of charge in an electrical circuit?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Electrical circuits can be used for sending signals, storing information, or doing calculations, but their most common purpose by far is to manipulate energy. We know that light bulbs are rated in units of watts, i.e., how many joules per second of energy they can convert into heat and light, but how would this relate to the flow of charge as measured in amperes? By way of analogy, suppose your friend, who did not take physics, cannot find any job better than pitching bales of hay. The number of calories he burns per hour will certainly depend on how many bales he pitches per minute, but it will also be proportional to how much mechanical work he has to do on each bale. If his job is to toss them up into a hayloft, he will get tired a lot more quickly than someone who merely tips bales off a loading dock into trucks. In metric units,\n\njoulessecond=haybalessecond×jouleshaybale.\n\nSimilarly, the rate of energy transformation by a battery will not just depend on how many coulombs per second it pushes through a circuit, but also on how much mechanical work it has to do on each coulomb of charge:\n\njoulessecond=coulombssecond×joulescoulomb\n\nor\n\npower=current×work per unit charge.\n\nUnits of joules per coulomb are abbreviated as volts, 1 V=1 J/C, named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta. Everyone knows that batteries are rated in units of volts, but the voltage concept is more general than that; it turns out that voltage is a property of every point in space. To gain more insight, let us think more carefully about what goes on in the battery and bulb circuit.\n\nTo do work on a charged particle, the battery apparently must be exerting forces on it. How does it do this? Well, the only thing that can exert an electrical force on a charged particle is another charged particle. It is as though the haybales were pushing and pulling each other into the hayloft! This is potentially a horribly complicated situation. Even if we knew how much excess positive or negative charge there was at every point in the circuit (which realistically we do not) we would have to calculate zillions of forces using Coulomb’s law, perform all the vector additions, and finally calculate how much work was being done on the charges as they moved along. To make things even more scary, there is more than one type of charged particle that moves: electrons are what move in the wires and the bulb’s filament, but ions are the moving charge carriers inside the battery. Luckily, there are two ways we can simplify things:\n\nThe situation is unchanging. Unlike the imaginary setup in which we attempted to light a bulb using a rubber rod and a piece of fur, this circuit maintains itself in a steady state (after perhaps a microsecond-long period of settling down after the circuit is first assembled). The current is steady, and as charge flows out of any area of the circuit, it is replaced by the same amount of charge flowing in. The amount of excess positive or negative charge in any part of the circuit therefore stays constant. Similarly, when we watch a river flowing, the water goes by but the river does not disappear.\n\nForce depends only on position. Since the charge distribution is not changing, the total electrical force on a charged particle depends only on its own charge and on its location. If another charged particle of the same type visits the same location later on, it will feel exactly the same force.\n\nThe second observation tells us that there is nothing all that different about the experience of one charged particle as compared to another. If we single out one particle to pay attention to, and figure out the amount of work done on it by electrical forces as it goes from point A to point B along a certain path, then this is the same amount of work that will be done on any other charged particles of the same type as it follows the same path. For the sake of visualization, let us think about the path that starts at one terminal of the battery, goes through the light bulb’s filament, and ends at the other terminal. When an object experiences a force that depends only on its position (and when certain other, technical conditions are satisfied), we can define an electrical energy associated with the position of that object—the amount of work done on the particle by electrical forces as it moves from A to B equals the drop in electrical energy between A and B. This electrical energy is what is being converted into other forms of energy such as heat and light. We therefore define voltage in general as electrical energy per unit charge.\n\nThe difference in voltage between two points in space is defined as\n\nΔV=ΔPEelec/q,\n\nwhere ΔPEelecΔPEelec is the change in the electrical energy of a particle with charge qq as it moves from the initial point to the final point.\n\nThe amount of power dissipated (i.e., rate at which energy is transformed by the flow of electricity) is then given by the equation\n\nP=IΔV.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the Big Bang theory?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Imagine the wave pattern made by the tip of a vibrating rod which is moving across water. If the rod had been vibrating in one place, we would have seen the familiar pattern of concentric circles, all centered on the same point. But since the source of the waves is moving, the wavelength is shortened on one side and lengthened on the other. This is known as the Doppler effect.\n\nNote that the velocity of the waves is a fixed property of the medium, so for example, the forward-going waves do not get an extra boost in speed as would a material object like a bullet being shot forward from an airplane.\n\nWe can also infer a change in frequency. Since the velocity is constant, the equation v=fλv=fλ tells us that the change in wavelength must be matched by an opposite change in frequency: higher frequency for the waves emitted forward, and lower for the ones emitted backward. The frequency Doppler effect is the reason for the familiar dropping-pitch sound of a race car going by. As the car approaches us, we hear a higher pitch, but after it passes us we hear a frequency that is lower than normal.\n\nThe Doppler effect will also occur if the observer is moving but the source is stationary. For instance, an observer moving toward a stationary source will perceive one crest of the wave, and will then be surrounded by the next crest sooner than she otherwise would have, because she has moved toward it and hastened her encounter with it. Roughly speaking, the Doppler effect depends only on the relative motion of the source and the observer, not on their absolute state of motion (which is not a well-defined notion in physics) or on their velocity relative to the medium.\n\nRestricting ourselves to the case of a moving source, and to waves emitted either directly along or directly against the direction of motion, we can easily calculate the wavelength, or equivalently the frequency, of the Doppler-shifted waves. Let vv be the velocity of the waves, and vsvs the velocity of the source. The wavelength of the forward-emitted waves is shortened by an amount vsTvsT equal to the distance traveled by the source over the course of one period. Using the definition f=1/Tf=1/T and the equation v=fλv=fλ, we find for the wavelength of the Doppler-shifted wave the equation\n\nλ′=(1−vsv)λ.\n\nA similar equation can be used for the backward-emitted waves, but with a plus sign rather than a minus sign.\n\nIf Doppler shifts depend only on the relative motion of the source and receiver, then there is no way for a person moving with the source and another person moving with the receiver to determine who is moving and who is not. Either can blame the Doppler shift entirely on the other’s motion and claim to be at rest herself. This is entirely in agreement with the principle stated originally by Galileo that all motion is relative.\n\nOn the other hand, a careful analysis of the Doppler shifts of water or sound waves shows that it is only approximately true, at low speeds, that the shifts just depend on the relative motion of the source and observer. For instance, it is possible for a jet plane to keep up with its own sound waves, so that the sound waves appear to stand still to the pilot of the plane. The pilot then knows she is moving at exactly the speed of sound. The reason this does not disprove the relativity of motion is that the pilot is not really determining her absolute motion, but rather her motion relative to the air, which is the medium of the sound waves.\n\nEinstein realized that this solved the problem for sound or water waves, but would not salvage the principle of relative motion in the case of light waves, since light is not a vibration of any physical medium such as water or air. Beginning by imagining what a beam of light would look like to a person riding a motorcycle alongside it, Einstein eventually came up with a radical new way of describing the universe, in which space and time are distorted as measured by observers in different states of motion. As a consequence of this theory of relativity, he showed that light waves would have Doppler shifts that would exactly, not just approximately, depend only on the relative motion of the source and receiver.\n\nAs soon as astronomers began looking at the sky through telescopes, they began noticing certain objects that looked like clouds in deep space. The fact that they looked the same night after night meant that they were beyond Earth’s atmosphere. Not knowing what they really were, but wanting to sound official, they called them “nebulae,” a Latin word meaning “clouds” but sounding more impressive. In the early 20th century, astronomers realized that although some really were clouds of gas (e.g., the middle “star” of Orion’s sword, which is visibly fuzzy even to the naked eye when conditions are good), others were what we now call galaxies: virtual island universes consisting of trillions of stars (for example the Andromeda Galaxy, which is visible as a fuzzy patch through binoculars). Three hundred years after Galileo had resolved the Milky Way into individual stars through his telescope, astronomers realized the universe is made of galaxies of stars, and the Milky Way is simply the visible part of the flat disk of our own galaxy, seen from inside.\n\nThis opened up the scientific study of cosmology, the structure and history of the universe as a whole, a field that had not been seriously attacked since the days of Newton. Newton had realized that if gravity was always attractive, never repulsive, the universe would have a tendency to collapse. His solution to the problem was to posit a universe that was infinite and uniformly populated with matter, so that it would have no geometrical center. The gravitational forces in such a universe would always tend to cancel out by symmetry, so there would be no collapse. By the 20th century, the belief in an unchanging and infinite universe had become conventional wisdom in science, partly as a reaction against the time that had been wasted trying to find explanations of ancient geological phenomena based on catastrophes suggested by biblical events like Noah’s flood.\n\nIn the 1920s, astronomer Edwin Hubble began studying the Doppler shifts of the light emitted by galaxies. A former college football player with a serious nicotine addiction, Hubble did not set out to change our image of the beginning of the universe. His autobiography seldom even mentions the cosmological discovery for which he is now remembered. When astronomers began to study the Doppler shifts of galaxies, they expected that each galaxy’s direction and velocity of motion would be essentially random. Some would be approaching us, and their light would therefore be Doppler-shifted to the blue end of the spectrum, while an equal number would be expected to have red shifts. What Hubble discovered instead was that except for a few very nearby ones, all the galaxies had red shifts, indicating that they were receding from us at a hefty fraction of the speed of light. Not only that, but the ones farther away were receding more quickly. The speeds were directly proportional to their distance from us.\n\nDid this mean that Earth (or at least our galaxy) was the center of the universe? No, because Doppler shifts of light only depend on the relative motion of the source and the observer. If we see a distant galaxy moving away from us at 10% of the speed of light, we can be assured that the astronomers who live in that galaxy will see ours receding from them at the same speed in the opposite direction. The whole universe can be envisioned as a rising loaf of raisin bread. As the bread expands, there is more and more space between the raisins. The farther apart two raisins are, the greater the speed with which they move apart.\n\nExtrapolating backward in time using the known laws of physics, the universe must have been denser and denser at earlier and earlier times. At some point, it must have been extremely dense and hot, and we can even detect the radiation from this early fireball, in the form of microwave radiation that permeates space. The phrase Big Bang was originally coined by the doubters of the theory to make it sound ridiculous, but it stuck, and today essentially all astronomers accept the Big Bang theory based on the very direct evidence of the red shifts and the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nFinally, it should be noted what the Big Bang theory is not. It is not an explanation of why the universe exists. Such questions belong to the realm of religion, not science. Science can find ever simpler and ever more fundamental explanations for a variety of phenomena, but ultimately science takes the universe as it is according to observations.\n\nFurthermore, there is an unfortunate tendency, even among many scientists, to speak of the Big Bang theory as a description of the very first event in the universe, which caused everything after it. Although it is true that time may have had a beginning (Einstein’s theory of general relativity admits such a possibility), the methods of science can only work within a certain range of conditions, such as temperature and density. Beyond a temperature of about 109,109 degrees C, the random thermal motion of subatomic particles becomes so rapid that its velocity is comparable to the speed of light. Early enough in the history of the universe, when these temperatures existed, Newtonian physics becomes less accurate, and we must describe nature using the more general description given by Einstein’s theory of relativity, which encompasses Newtonian physics as a special case. At even higher temperatures, beyond about 103,310,33 degrees, physicists know that Einstein’s theory as well begins to fall apart, but we do not know how to construct the even more general theory of nature that would work at those temperatures. No matter how far physics progresses, we will never be able to describe nature at infinitely-high temperatures, since there is a limit to the temperatures we can explore by experiment and observation in order to guide us to the right theory. We are confident that we understand the basic physics involved in the evolution of the universe starting a few minutes after the Big Bang, and we may be able to push back to milliseconds or microseconds after it, but we cannot use the methods of science to deal with the beginning of time itself.###"}
{"prompt": "How is temperature defined?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " We use the term temperature casually, but what is it exactly? Roughly speaking, temperature is a measure of how concentrated the heat energy is in an object. A large, massive object with very little heat energy in it has a low temperature.\n\nBut physics deals with operational definitions, i.e., definitions of how to measure the thing in question. How do we measure temperature? One common feature of all temperature-measuring devices is that they must be left for a while in contact with the thing whose temperature is being measured. When you take your temperature with a fever thermometer, you wait for the mercury inside to come up to the same temperature as your body. The thermometer actually tells you the temperature of its own working fluid (in this case, the mercury). In general, the idea of temperature depends on the concept of thermal equilibrium. When you mix cold eggs from the refrigerator with flour that has been at room temperature, they rapidly reach a compromise temperature. What determines this compromise temperature is conservation of energy, and the amount of energy required to heat or cool each substance by one degree. But without even having constructed a temperature scale, we can see that the important point is the phenomenon of thermal equilibrium itself: two objects left in contact will approach the same temperature. We also assume that if object A is at the same temperature as object B, and B is at the same temperature as C, then A is at the same temperature as C. This statement is sometimes known as the zeroth law of thermodynamics, so called because after the first, second, and third laws had been developed, it was realized that there was another law that was even more fundamental.\n\nThe familiar mercury thermometer operates on the principle that the mercury, its working fluid, expands when heated and contracts when cooled. In general, all substances expand and contract with changes in temperature. The zeroth law of thermodynamics guarantees that we can construct a comparative scale of temperatures that is independent of what type of thermometer we use. If a thermometer gives a certain reading when it is in thermal equilibrium with object A, and also gives the same reading for object B, then A and B must be the same temperature, regardless of the details of how the thermometers works.\n\nWhat about constructing a temperature scale in which every degree represents an equal step in temperature? The Celsius scale has 0 as the freezing point of water and 100 as its boiling point. The hidden assumption behind all this is that since two points define a line, any two thermometers that agree at two points must agree at all other points. In reality, if we calibrate a mercury thermometer and an alcohol thermometer in this way, we will find that a graph of one thermometer’s reading versus the other is not a perfectly straight y=xy=x line. The subtle inconsistency becomes a drastic one when we try to extend the temperature scale through the points where mercury and alcohol boil or freeze. Gases, however, are much more consistent among themselves in their thermal expansion than solids or liquids, and the noble gases like helium and neon are more consistent with each other than gases in general. Continuing to search for consistency, we find that noble gases are more consistent with each other when their pressure is very low.\n\nAs an idealization, we imagine a gas in which the atoms interact only with the sides of the container, not with each other. Such a gas is perfectly nonreactive (as the noble gases very nearly are), and never condenses to a liquid (as the noble gases do only at extremely low temperatures). Its atoms take up a negligible fraction of the available volume. Any gas can be made to behave much like this if the pressure is extremely low, so that the atoms hardly ever encounter each other. Such a gas is called an ideal gas, and we define the Celsius scale in terms of the volume of the gas in a thermometer whose working substance is an ideal gas maintained at a fixed (very low) pressure, and which is calibrated at 0 and 100 degrees according to the melting and boiling points of water. The Celsius scale is not just a comparative scale, but an additive one as well: every step in temperature is equal, and it makes sense to say that the difference in temperature between 18 and 28°C28°C is the same as the difference between 48 and 58.\n\nWe find that if we extrapolate a graph of volume versus temperature, the volume becomes zero at nearly the same temperature for all gases: -273°C. Real gases will all condense into liquids at some temperature above this, but an ideal gas would achieve zero volume at this temperature, known as absolute zero. The most useful temperature scale in scientific work is one whose zero is defined by absolute zero, rather than by some arbitrary standard like the melting point of water. The ideal temperature scale for scientific work, called the Kelvin scale, is the same as the Celsius scale, but shifted by 273 degrees to make its zero coincide with absolute zero. Scientists use the Celsius scale only for comparisons or when a change in temperature is all that is required for a calculation. Only on the Kelvin scale does it make sense to discuss ratios of temperatures, e.g., to say that one temperature is twice as hot as another.###"}
{"prompt": "How do we define \"nothing\" if it is impossible to do so?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " One of the trickiest things to define is “nothing.” Why is it difficult to define? Once you try to define “nothing,” it becomes something. Even if you think of “nothing” as an abstract concept, it still would not be nothing, as then it would be an abstract concept.\n\nThen how do we define “nothing” if it is impossible to do so? We can try to define it by saying that we can say nothing about it. At least that avoids it being concretely related to the word “undefined,” which is more about not being able to set limits on something or set a meaning to something. In the case of “nothing,” we cannot say anything about it.\n\nThough Oxford dictionaries defines “nothing” as “1. not anything; no single thing” and “2. something that is not at all important or interesting” this is still saying something about it (Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries). But I guess you might as well say “nothing” is something that cannot be discussed. However, we used the word “something” and now we have come to another dead end.\n\nIn physics, we understand there cannot be truly nothing, as even in a total vacuum—where there is no gravity, particles, or energy—quantum fluctuations appear and disappear constantly, (Cain, Fraser). Creating a space where there are no quantum fluctuations requires an enormous amount of energy, and there would be a remnant of that energy in that space after the fluctuations have been flushed out, plus an unstable environment (1veritasium). So even on a physical level, “nothing” cannot be present.\n\nIn defining nothing, it is best to keep our mouths shut, as it cannot be defined by any means. “Nothing,” in fact, does not exist; as if it did, it would not be nothing. In this perspective, we might say the best definition of “nothing” is that it is something that is not something, which is quite a contradiction. We have a word for “nothing,” but that does not mean there is such a thing as “nothing.”###"}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between torque and force?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Force can be interpreted as the rate of transfer of momentum. The equivalent in the case of angular momentum is called torque. Where force tells us how hard we are pushing or pulling on something, torque indicates how hard we are twisting on it. Torque is represented by the Greek letter tau, ττ, and the rate of change of an object’s angular momentum equals the total torque acting on it:\n\nτtotal=ΔLΔt.\n\n(If the angular momentum does not change at a constant rate, the total torque equals the slope of the tangent line on a graph of LL versus tt.)\n\nAs with force and momentum, it often happens that angular momentum recedes into the background and we focus our interest on the torques. The torque-focused point of view is exemplified by the fact that many scientifically-untrained but mechanically-apt people know all about torque, but none of them have heard of angular momentum. Car enthusiasts eagerly compare engines’ torques, and there is a tool called a torque wrench that allows one to apply a desired amount of torque to a screw and avoid overtightening it.\n\nOf course a force is necessary in order to create a torque—you cannot twist a screw without pushing on the wrench—but force and torque are two different things. One distinction between them is direction. We use positive and negative signs to represent forces in the two possible directions along a line. The direction of a torque, however, is clockwise or counterclockwise, not a linear direction.\n\nThe other difference between torque and force is a matter of leverage. A given force applied at a door’s knob will change the door’s angular momentum twice as rapidly as the same force applied halfway between the knob and the hinge. The same amount of force produces different amounts of torque in these two cases.\n\nIt is possible to have a zero total torque with a nonzero total force. An airplane with four jet engines, o, would be designed so that their forces are balanced on the left and right. Their forces are all in the same direction, but the clockwise torques of two of the engines are canceled by the counterclockwise torques of the other two, giving zero total torque.\n\nConversely we can have zero total force and nonzero total torque. A merry-go-round’s engine needs to supply a nonzero torque on it to bring it up to speed, but there is zero total force on it. If there was not zero total force on it, its center of mass would accelerate!\n\nHow do we calculate the amount of torque produced by a given force? Since it depends on leverage, we should expect it to depend on the distance between the axis and the point of application of the force. We will derive an equation relating torque to force for a particular, simple situation, and state without proof that the equation applies to all situations.\n\nTo try to pin down this relationship more precisely, let us imagine hitting a tetherball. The boy applies a force FF to the ball for a short time ΔtΔt, accelerating the ball from rest to a velocity vv. Since force is the rate of transfer of momentum, we have:\n\nSince the initial velocity is zero, Δv is the same as the final velocity v. Multiplying both sides by r givesFr=mΔvΔt.=mvrΔt.\n\nSince the initial velocity is zero, Δv is the same as the final velocity v. Multiplying both sides by r givesFr=mvrΔt.\n\nBut mvrmvr is simply the amount of angular momentum he has given the ball, so mvr/Δtmvr/Δt also equals the amount of torque he applied. The result of this example is:\n\nτ=Fr.\n\nIf the boy had applied a force parallel to the radius line, either directly inward or outward, then the ball would not have picked up any clockwise or counterclockwise angular momentum.\n\nIf a force acts at an angle other than 0 or 90° with respect to the line joining the object and the axis, it would be only the component of the force perpendicular to the line that would produce a torque:\n\nτ=F⊥r.\n\nAlthough this result was proved under a simplified set of circumstances, it is more generally valid.\n\nThe rate at which a force transfers angular momentum to an object, i.e., the torque produced by the force, is given by:\n\n|τ|=r|F⊥|,\n\nwhere rr is the distance from the axis to the point of application of the force, and F⊥F⊥ is the component of the force that is perpendicular to the line joining the axis to the point of application.\n\nThe equation is stated with absolute value signs because the positive and negative signs of force and torque indicate different things, so there is no useful relationship between them. The sign of the torque must be found by physical inspection of the case at hand.\n\nFrom the equation, we see that the units of torque can be written as newtons multiplied by meters. Metric torque wrenches are calibrated in N⋅mN⋅m, but American ones use foot-pounds, which is also a unit of distance multiplied by a unit of force. Newtons multiplied by meters equal joules, but torque is a completely different quantity from work, and nobody writes torques with units of joules, even though it would be technically correct.\n\nSometimes torque can be more neatly visualized in terms of the quantity r⊥r⊥, which gives us a third way of expressing the relationship between torque and force:\n\n|τ|=r⊥|F|.\n\nOf course, you would not want to go and memorize all three equations for torque. Starting from any one of them, you could easily derive the other two using trigonometry. Familiarizing yourself with them can however clue you in to easier avenues of attack on certain problems.\n\nUp until now, we have been thinking in terms of a force that acts at a single point on an object, such as the force of your hand on the wrench. This is of course an approximation, and for an extremely realistic calculation of your hand’s torque on the wrench, you might need to add up the torques exerted by each square millimeter where your skin touches the wrench. This is seldom necessary. But in the case of a gravitational force, there is never any single point at which the force is applied. Our planet is exerting a separate tug on every brick in the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and the total gravitational torque on the tower is the sum of the torques contributed by all the little forces. Luckily there is a trick that allows us to avoid such a massive calculation. It turns out that for purposes of computing the total gravitational torque on an object, you can get the right answer by pretending that the whole gravitational force acts at the object’s center of mass.###"}
{"prompt": "How does the kinetic theory of heat explain the true nature of temperature?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is heat? Is it an invisible fluid your bare feet soak up from a hot sidewalk? Can one ever remove all the heat from an object? Is there a maximum to the temperature scale?\n\nThe theory of heat as a fluid seemed to explain why colder objects absorbed heat from hotter ones, but once it became clear that heat was a form of energy, it began to seem unlikely that a material substance could transform itself into and out of all those other forms of energy, like motion or light. For instance, a compost pile gets hot, and we describe this as a case where, through the action of bacteria, chemical energy stored in the plant cuttings is transformed into heat energy. The heating occurs even if there is no nearby warmer object that could have been leaking “heat fluid” into the pile.\n\nAn alternative interpretation of heat was suggested by the theory that matter is made of atoms. Since gases are thousands of times less dense than solids or liquids, the atoms (or clusters of atoms called molecules) in a gas must be far apart. In that case, what is keeping all the air molecules from settling into a thin film on the floor of a room? The simplest explanation is that they are moving very rapidly, continually ricocheting off of the floor, walls, and ceiling. Though bizarre, the cloud-of-bullets image of a gas did give a natural explanation for the surprising ability of something as tenuous as a gas to exert huge forces. Your car’s tires can hold it up because you have pumped extra molecules into them. The inside of the tire gets hit by molecules more often than the outside, forcing it to stretch and stiffen.\n\nThe outward forces of the air in your car’s tires increase even further when you drive on the freeway for a while, heating up the rubber and the air inside. This type of observation leads naturally to the conclusion that hotter matter differs from colder in that its atoms’ random motion is more rapid. In a liquid, the motion could be visualized as people in a milling crowd shoving past each other more quickly. In a solid, where the atoms are packed together, the motion is a random vibration of each atom as it knocks against its neighbors.\n\nWe thus achieve a great simplification in the theory of heat. Heat is simply a form of kinetic energy, the total kinetic energy of random motion of all the atoms in an object. With this new understanding, it becomes possible to answer at one stroke the questions posed at the beginning of the section. Yes, it is at least theoretically possible to remove all the heat from an object. The coldest possible temperature, known as absolute zero, is that at which all the atoms have zero velocity, so that their kinetic energies, (1/2)mv2(1/2)mv2, are all zero. No, there is no maximum amount of heat that a certain quantity of matter can have, and no maximum to the temperature scale, since arbitrarily large values of vv can create arbitrarily large amounts of kinetic energy per atom.\n\nThe kinetic theory of heat also provides a simple explanation of the true nature of temperature. Temperature is a measure of the amount of energy per molecule, whereas heat is the total amount of energy possessed by all the molecules in an object.\n\nThere is an entire branch of physics, called thermodynamics, that deals with heat and temperature and forms the basis for technologies, such as refrigeration. It is only true for a gas that all heat is in the form of kinetic energy. In solids and liquids, the atoms are close enough to each other to exert intense electrical forces on each other, and there is therefore another type of energy involved, the energy associated with the atoms’ distances from each other. Strictly speaking, heat energy is defined not as energy associated with random motion of molecules, but as any form of energy that can be conducted between objects in contact, without any force.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between momentum and kinetic energy?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Your first encounter with the conservation of momentum may have come as a small child unjustly confined to a shopping cart. You spot something interesting to play with, like the display case of imported wine down at the end of the aisle, and decide to push the cart over there. But being imprisoned by Dad in the cart was not the only injustice that day. There was a far greater conspiracy to thwart your young identity, one that originated in the laws of nature. Pushing forward did nudge the cart forward, but it pushed you backward. If the wheels of the cart were well lubricated, it would not matter how you jerked, yanked, or kicked off from the back of the cart. You could not cause any overall forward motion of the entire system consisting of the cart with you inside.\n\nIn Newtonian framework, we describe this as arising from Newton’s third law. The cart made a force on you that was equal and opposite to your force on it. In the framework of conservation laws, we cannot attribute your frustration to conservation of energy. It would have been perfectly possible for you to transform some of the internal chemical energy stored in your body to kinetic energy of the cart and your body.\n\nThe following characteristics of the situation suggest there may be a new conservation law involved:\n\nA closed system is involved. All conservation laws deal with closed systems. You and the cart are a closed system, since the well-oiled wheels prevent the floor from making any forward force on you.\n\nSomething remains unchanged. The overall velocity of the system started out being zero, and you cannot change it. This vague reference to “overall velocity” can be made more precise: it is the velocity of the system’s center of mass that cannot be changed.\n\nSomething can be transferred back and forth without changing the total amount. If we define forward as positive and backward as negative, then one part of the system can gain positive motion if another part acquires negative motion. If we do not want to worry about positive and negative signs, we can imagine that the whole cart was initially gliding forward on its well-oiled wheels. By kicking off from the back of the cart, you could increase your own velocity, but this inevitably causes the cart to slow down.\n\nIt thus appears that there is some numerical measure of an object’s quantity of motion that is conserved when you add up all the objects within a system.\n\nAlthough velocity has been referred to, it is not the total velocity of a closed system that remains constant. If it was, then firing a gun would cause the gun to recoil at the same velocity as the bullet! The gun does recoil, but at a much lower velocity than the bullet. Newton’s third law tells us\n\nFgun on bullet=−Fbullet on gun,\n\nand assuming a constant force for simplicity, Newton’s second law allows us to change this to\n\nmbulletΔvbulletΔt=−mgunΔvgunΔt.\n\nThus, if the gun has 100 times more mass than the bullet, it will recoil at a velocity that is 100 times smaller and in the opposite direction, represented by the opposite sign. The quantity mvmv is therefore apparently a useful measure of motion, and we give it a name, momentum, and a symbol, pp. (as far as I know, the letter “p” was chosen at random, since “m” was already being used for mass). The situations discussed so far have been one-dimensional, but in three-dimensional situations it is treated as a vector.\n\nThe momentum of a material object, i.e., a piece of matter, is defined as\n\np=mv,\n\nthe product of the object’s mass and its velocity vector.\n\nThe units of momentum are kg⋅m/skg⋅m/s, and there is unfortunately no abbreviation for this clumsy combination of units.\n\nThe reasoning leading up to the definition of momentum was all based on the search for a conservation law, and the only reason why we bother to define such a quantity is that experiments show it is conserved:\n\nthe law of conservation of momentum\n\nIn any closed system, the vector sum of all the momenta remains constant,\n\np1i+p2i+…=p1f+p2f+…,\n\nwhere ii labels the initial and ff the final momenta (a closed system is one on which no external forces act).\n\nA subtle point about conservation laws is that they all refer to “closed systems,” but “closed” means different things in different cases. When discussing conservation of mass, “closed” means a system that does not have matter moving in or out of it. With energy, we mean there is no work or heat transfer occurring across the boundary of the system. For momentum conservation, “closed” means there are no external forces reaching into the system.\n\nExample 1: A cannon\n\n– A cannon of mass 1000 kg fires a 10-kg shell at a velocity of 200 m/s. At what speed does the cannon recoil?\n\n– The law of conservation of momentum tells us that\n\npcannon,i+pshell,i=pcannon,f+pshell,f.\n\nChoosing a coordinate system in which the cannon points in the positive direction, the given information is\n\npcannon,ipshell,ipshell,f=0=0=2000 kg⋅m/s.\n\nWe must have pcannon,f=−2000 kg⋅m/spcannon,f=−2000 kg⋅m/s, so the recoil velocity of the cannon is −2−2 m/s.\n\nion-drive\n\nThe ion drive engine of the NASA Deep Space 1 probe is under construction and being tested in a vacuum chamber prior to its October 1998 launch. Intended mainly as a test vehicle for new technologies, the craft nevertheless carried out a successful scientific program that included a flyby of a comet.\n\nExample 2: Ion drive for propelling spacecraft\n\n– The experimental solar-powered ion drive of the Deep Space 1 space probe expels its xenon gas exhaust at a speed of 30,000 m/s, ten times faster than the exhaust velocity for a typical chemical-fuel rocket engine. Roughly how many times greater is the maximum speed this spacecraft can reach, compared with a chemical-fueled probe with the same mass of fuel (“reaction mass”) available for pushing out the back as exhaust?\n\n– Momentum equals mass multiplied by velocity. Both spacecraft are assumed to have the same amount of reaction mass, and the ion drive’s exhaust has a velocity ten times greater, so the momentum of its exhaust is ten times greater. Before the engine starts firing, neither the probe nor the exhaust has any momentum, so the total momentum of the system is zero. By conservation of momentum, the total momentum must also be zero after all the exhaust has been expelled. If we define the positive direction as the direction the spacecraft is going, then the negative momentum of the exhaust is canceled by the positive momentum of the spacecraft. The ion drive allows a final speed that is ten times greater (this simplified analysis ignores the fact that the reaction mass expelled later in the burn is not moving backward as fast, because of the forward speed of the already-moving spacecraft).\n\nAs with all the conservation laws, the law of conservation of momentum has evolved over time. In the 1800s, it was found that a beam of light striking an object would give it some momentum, even though light has no mass, and would therefore have no momentum according to the above definition. Rather than discarding the principle of conservation of momentum, the physicists of the time decided to see if the definition of momentum could be extended to include momentum carried by light. The process is analogous to the process outlined on page 295 for identifying new forms of energy. The first step was the discovery that light could impart momentum to matter, and the second step was to show that the momentum possessed by light could be related in a definite way to observable properties of the light. They found that the conservation of momentum could be successfully generalized by attributing to a beam of light a momentum vector in the direction of the light’s motion and having a magnitude proportional to the amount of energy the light possessed. The momentum of light is negligible under ordinary circumstances, e.g., a flashlight left on for an hour would only absorb about 10−5 kg⋅m/s10−5 kg⋅m/s of momentum as it recoiled.\n\nExample 3: The tail of a comet\n\nMomentum is not always equal to mvmv. Like many comets, Halley’s comet has a very elongated elliptical orbit. About once per century, its orbit brings it close to the sun. The comet’s head, or nucleus, is composed of dirty ice, so the energy deposited by the intense sunlight boils off steam and dust, b. The sunlight does not just carry energy, however—it also carries momentum. The momentum of the sunlight impacting on the smaller dust particles pushes them away from the sun, forming a tail, c. By analogy with matter, for which momentum equals mvmv, you would expect that massless light would have zero momentum, but the equation p=mvp=mv is not the correct one for light, and light does have momentum (the gases typically form a second, distinct tail whose motion is controlled by the sun’s magnetic field).\n\nThe reason for bringing this up is not so that you can plug numbers into a formulas in these exotic situations. The point is that the conservation laws have proven so sturdy exactly because they can easily be amended to fit new circumstances. Newton’s laws are no longer at the center of the stage of physics because they did not have the same adaptability. More generally, the moral of this story is the provisional nature of scientific truth.\n\nIt should also be noted that conservation of momentum is not a consequence of Newton’s laws, as is often asserted in textbooks. Newton’s laws do not apply to light, and therefore could not possibly be used to prove anything about a concept as general as the conservation of momentum in its modern form.\n\nMomentum and kinetic energy are both measures of the quantity of motion, and a sideshow in the Newton-Leibnitz controversy over who invented calculus was an argument over whether mv (i.e., momentum) or mv2mv2 (i.e., kinetic energy without the 1/2 in front) was the “true” measure of motion. The modern student can certainly be excused for wondering why we need both quantities, when their complementary nature was not evident to the greatest minds of the 1700s. The following table highlights their differences.\n\n###"}
{"prompt": "How does the conservation of energy relate to the idea that motion is relative?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The technical term for the energy associated with motion is kinetic energy, from the Greek word for motion (the root is the same as the root of the word “cinema” for a motion picture, and in French the term for kinetic energy is “énergie cinétique”). To find how much kinetic energy is possessed by a given moving object, we must convert all its kinetic energy into heat energy, which we have chosen as the standard reference type of energy. We could do this, for example, by firing projectiles into a tank of water and measuring the increase in temperature of the water as a function of the projectile’s mass and velocity. Consider the following data from a series of three such experiments:\n\nm (kg)	v (m/s)	energy (J)\n1.00	1.00	0.50\n1.00	2.00	2.00\n2.00	1.00	1.00\n\nComparing the first experiment with the second, we see that doubling the object’s velocity does not just double its energy, it quadruples it. If we compare the first and third lines, however, we find that doubling the mass only doubles the energy. This suggests that kinetic energy is proportional to mass and to the square of velocity, KE∝mv2KE∝mv2, and further experiments of this type would indeed establish such a general rule. The proportionality factor equals 0.5 because of the design of the metric system, so the kinetic energy of a moving object is given by\n\nKE=12mv2.\n\nThe metric system is based on the meter, kilogram, and second, with other units being derived from those. Comparing the units on the left and right sides of the equation shows that the joule can be reexpressed in terms of the basic units as kg⋅m2/s2kg⋅m2/s2.\n\nStudents are often mystified by the occurrence of the factor of 1/2, but it is less obscure than it looks. The metric system was designed so that some of the equations relating to energy would come out looking simple, at the expense of some others, which had to have inconvenient conversion factors in front. If we were using the old British Engineering System of units, then we would have the British Thermal Unit (BTU) as our unit of energy. In that system, the equation you would learn for kinetic energy would have an inconvenient proportionality constant, KE=(1.29×10−3)mv2KE=(1.29×10−3)mv2, with KEKE measured in units of BTUs, vv measured in feet per second, and so on. At the expense of this inconvenient equation for kinetic energy, the designers of the British Engineering System got a simple rule for calculating the energy required to heat water: one BTU per degree Fahrenheit per pound. The inventor of kinetic energy, Thomas Young, actually defined it as KE=mv2KE=mv2, which meant that all his other equations had to be different from ours by a factor of two. All these systems of units work just fine as long as they are not combined with one another in an inconsistent way.\n\n– Comet Shoemaker-Levy, which struck the planet Jupiter in 1994, had a mass of roughly 4×10134×1013 kg, and was moving at a speed of 60 km/s. Compare the kinetic energy released in the impact to the total energy in the world’s nuclear arsenals, which is 2×10192×1019 J. Assume for the sake of simplicity that Jupiter was at rest.\n\n– Since we assume Jupiter was at rest, we can imagine that the comet stopped completely on impact, and 100% of its kinetic energy was converted to heat and sound. We first convert the speed to mks units, v=6×104v=6×104 m/s, and then plug in to the equation to find that the comet’s kinetic energy was roughly 7×10227×1022 J, or about 3000 times the energy in the world’s nuclear arsenals.\n\nIs there any way to derive the equation KE=(1/2)mv2KE=(1/2)mv2 mathematically from first principles? No, it is purely empirical. The factor of 1/2 in front is definitely not derivable, since it is different in different systems of units. The proportionality to v2v2 is not even quite correct; experiments have shown deviations from the v2v2 rule at high speeds, an effect that is related to Einstein’s theory of relativity. Only the proportionality to mm is inevitable. The whole energy concept is based on the idea that we add up energy contributions from all the objects within a system. Based on this philosophy, it is logically necessary that a 2-kg object moving at 1 m/s have the same kinetic energy as two 1-kg objects moving side-by-side at the same speed.\n\nAlthough I mentioned Einstein’s theory of relativity above, it is more relevant right now to consider how the conservation of energy relates to the simpler Galilean idea that motion is relative. Galileo’s Aristotelian enemies (and it is no exaggeration to call them enemies!) would probably have objected to conservation of energy. After all, the Galilean idea that an object in motion will continue in motion indefinitely in the absence of a force is not so different from the idea that an object’s kinetic energy stays the same unless there is a mechanism like frictional heating for converting that energy into some other form.\n\nMore subtly, however, it is not immediately obvious that what we have learned so far about energy is strictly mathematically consistent with the principle that motion is relative. Suppose we verify that a certain process, say the collision of two pool balls, conserves energy as measured in a certain frame of reference: the sum of the balls’ kinetic energies before the collision is equal to their sum after the collision (in reality, we would need to add in other forms of energy, like heat and sound, that are liberated by the collision, but let us keep it simple). But what if we were to measure everything in a frame of reference that was in a different state of motion? A particular pool ball might have less kinetic energy in this new frame; for example, if the new frame of reference was moving right along with it, its kinetic energy in that frame would be zero. On the other hand, some other balls might have a greater kinetic energy in the new frame. It is not immediately obvious that the total energy before the collision will still equal the total energy after the collision. After all, the equation for kinetic energy is fairly complicated, since it involves the square of the velocity, so it would be surprising if everything still worked out in the new frame of reference. It does still work out.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between mass and weight?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What about cases where the total force on an object is not zero, so that Newton’s first law does not apply? The object will have an acceleration. How much acceleration will it have? It will clearly depend on both the object’s mass and on the amount of force.\n\nExperiments with any particular object show that its acceleration is directly proportional to the total force applied to it. This may seem wrong, since we know of many cases where small amounts of force fail to move an object at all, and larger forces get it going. This apparent failure of proportionality actually results from forgetting that there is a frictional force in addition to the force we apply to move the object. The object’s acceleration is exactly proportional to the total force on it, not to any individual force on it. In the absence of friction, even a very tiny force can slowly change the velocity of a very massive object.\n\nExperiments also show that the acceleration is inversely proportional to the object’s mass, and combining these two proportionalities gives the following way of predicting the acceleration of any object:\n\nAs with the first law, the second law can be easily generalized to include a much larger class of interesting situations:\n\nSuppose an object is being acted on by two sets of forces, one set lying parallel to the object’s initial direction of motion and another set acting along a perpendicular line. If the forces perpendicular to the initial direction of motion cancel out, then the object accelerates along its original line of motion according to a=F∥/ma=F∥/m, where F∥F∥ is the sum of the forces parallel to the line.\n\nExample: A coin sliding across a table.\n\nSuppose a coin is sliding to the right across a table, f, and let’s choose a positive xx axis that points to the right. The coin’s velocity is positive, and we expect based on experience that it will slow down, i.e., its acceleration should be negative.\n\nAlthough the coin’s motion is purely horizontal, it feels both vertical and horizontal forces. The Earth exerts a downward gravitational force F2F2 on it, and the table makes an upward force F3F3 that prevents the coin from sinking into the wood. In fact, without these vertical forces, the horizontal frictional force would not exist: surfaces do not exert friction against one another unless they are being pressed together.\n\nAlthough F2F2 and F3F3 contribute to the physics, they do so only indirectly. The only thing that directly relates to the acceleration along the horizontal direction is the horizontal force: a=F1/ma=F1/m.\n\nMass is different from weight, but they are related. An apple’s mass tells us how hard it is to change its motion. Its weight measures the strength of the gravitational attraction between the apple and the planet Earth. The apple’s weight is less on the moon, but its mass is the same. Astronauts assembling the International Space Station in zero gravity could not just pitch massive modules back and forth with their bare hands; the modules were weightless, but not massless.\n\nWe have already seen the experimental evidence that when weight (the force of the earth’s gravity) is the only force acting on an object, its acceleration equals the constant gg, and gg depends on where you are on the surface of Earth, but not on the mass of the object. Applying Newton’s second law then allows us to calculate the magnitude of the gravitational force on any object in terms of its mass:\n\n|FW|=mg.\n|FW|=mg.\n\n(The equation only gives the magnitude, i.e. the absolute value, of FWFW, because we are defining gg as a positive number, so it equals the absolute value of a falling object’s acceleration.)###"}
{"prompt": "How does Newton's third law apply to the forces between two objects?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Newton created the modern concept of force starting from his insight that all the effects that govern motion are interactions between two objects: unlike the Aristotelian theory, Newtonian physics has no phenomena in which an object changes its own motion.\n\nIs one object always the “order-giver” and the other the “order-follower”? As an example, consider a batter hitting a baseball. The bat definitely exerts a large force on the ball, because the ball accelerates drastically. But if you have ever hit a baseball, you also know that the ball makes a force on the bat—often with painful results if your technique is as bad as mine!\n\nHow does the ball’s force on the bat compare with the bat’s force on the ball? The bat’s acceleration is not as spectacular as the ball’s, but maybe we should not expect it to be, since the bat’s mass is much greater. In fact, careful measurements of both objects’ masses and accelerations would show that mballaballmballaball is very nearly equal to −mbatabat−mbatabat, which suggests that the ball’s force on the bat is of the same magnitude as the bat’s force on the ball, but in the opposite direction.\n\nForces occur in equal and opposite pairs: whenever object A exerts a force on object B, object B must also be exerting a force on object A. The two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nIn one-dimensional situations, we can use plus and minus signs to indicate the directions of forces, and Newton’s third law can be written succinctly as FA on B=−FB on AFA on B=−FB on A.\n\nThere is no cause and effect relationship between the two forces in Newton’s third law. There is no “original” force, and neither one is a response to the other. The pair of forces is a relationship, like marriage, not a back-and-forth process like a tennis match. Newton came up with the third law as a generalization about all the types of forces with which he was familiar, such as frictional and gravitational forces. When later physicists discovered a new type of force, such as the force that holds atomic nuclei together, they had to check whether it obeyed Newton’s third law. So far, no violation of the third law has ever been discovered, whereas the first and second laws were shown to have limitations by Einstein and the pioneers of atomic physics.\n\nThe English vocabulary for describing forces is unfortunately rooted in Aristotelianism, and often implies incorrectly that forces are one-way relationships. It is unfortunate that a half-truth such as “the table exerts an upward force on the book” is so easily expressed, while a more complete and correct description ends up sounding awkward or strange: “the table and the book interact via a force,” or “the table and book participate in a force.”\n\nTo students, it often sounds as though Newton’s third law implies nothing could ever change its motion, since the two equal and opposite forces would always cancel. The two forces, however, are always on two different objects, so it doesn’t make sense to add them in the first place—we only add forces that are acting on the same object. If two objects are interacting via a force and no other forces are involved, then both objects will accelerate—in opposite directions!###"}
{"prompt": "What are Kepler's three laws of planetary motion?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Newton would not have been able to figure out why the planets move the way they do if it had not been for the astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) and his protege Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), who together came up with the first simple and accurate description of how the planets actually do move. The relatively simple orbital motions of the earth and Mars combine so that as seen from earth Mars appears to be staggering in loops like a drunken sailor.\n\nBrahe, the last of the great naked-eye astronomers, collected extensive data on the motions of the planets over a period of many years, taking the giant step from the previous observations’ accuracy of about 10 minutes of arc (10/60 of a degree) to an unprecedented 1 minute. The quality of his work is all the more remarkable considering that his observatory consisted of four giant brass protractors mounted upright in his castle in Denmark. Four different observers would simultaneously measure the position of a planet in order to check for mistakes and reduce random errors.\n\nWith Brahe’s death, it fell to his former assistant Kepler to try to make some sense out of the volumes of data. Kepler, in contradiction to his late boss, had formed a prejudice, a correct one as it turned out, in favor of the theory that the earth and planets revolved around the sun, rather than the earth staying fixed and everything rotating about it. Although motion is relative, it is not just a matter of opinion what circles what. The earth’s rotation and revolution about the sun make it a noninertial reference frame, which causes detectable violations of Newton’s laws when one attempts to describe sufficiently precise experiments in the earth-fixed frame. Although such direct experiments were not carried out until the 19th century, what convinced everyone of the sun-centered system in the 17th century was that Kepler was able to come up with a surprisingly simple set of mathematical and geometrical rules for describing the planets’ motion using the sun-centered assumption. After 900 pages of calculations and many false starts and dead-end ideas, Kepler finally synthesized the data into the following three laws:\n\nThe planets orbit the sun in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus.\n\nThe line connecting a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal amounts of time.\n\nThe time required for a planet to orbit the sun, called its period, is proportional to the long axis of the ellipse raised to the 3/2 power. The constant of proportionality is the same for all the planets.\n\nAlthough the planets’ orbits are ellipses rather than circles, most are very close to being circular. The earth’s orbit, for instance, is only flattened by 1.7% relative to a circle. In the special case of a planet in a circular orbit, the two foci (plural of “focus”) coincide at the center of the circle, and Kepler’s elliptical orbit law thus says that the circle is centered on the sun. The equal-area law implies that a planet in a circular orbit moves around the sun with constant speed. For a circular orbit, the law of periods then amounts to a statement that the time for one orbit is proportional to r3/2r3/2, where rr is the radius. If all the planets were moving in their orbits at the same speed, then the time for one orbit would simply depend on the circumference of the circle, so it would only be proportional to rr to the first power. The more drastic dependence on r3/2r3/2 means that the outer planets must be moving more slowly than the inner planets.###"}
{"prompt": "What is Newton's first law of motion?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In other words, an object initially at rest is predicted to remain at rest if the total force acting on it is zero, and an object in motion remains in motion with the same velocity in the same direction. The converse of Newton’s first law is also true: if we observe an object moving with constant velocity along a straight line, then the total force on it must be zero. You may encounter the term “net force,” which is simply a synonym for total force.\n\nWhat happens if the total force on an object is not zero? It accelerates. Numerical prediction of the resulting acceleration is the topic of Newton’s second law.\n\nThis is the first of Newton’s three laws of motion. It is not important to memorize which of Newton’s three laws are numbers one, two, and three. If a future physics teacher asks you something like, “Which of Newton’s laws are you thinking of?,” a perfectly acceptable answer is “The one about constant velocity when there is zero total force.” The concepts are more important than any specific formulation of them. Newton wrote in Latin, and I am not aware of any modern textbook that uses a verbatim translation of his statement of the laws of motion. Clear writing was not in vogue in Newton’s day, and he formulated his three laws in terms of a concept now called momentum, only later relating it to the concept of force. Nearly all modern texts start with force and do momentum later.\n\nTo many students, the statement in the example that the cable’s upward force “cancels” Earth’s downward gravitational force implies that there has been a contest, and the cable’s force has won, vanquishing Earth’s gravitational force and making it disappear. That is incorrect. Both forces continue to exist, but because they add up numerically to zero, the elevator has no center-of-mass acceleration. We know that both forces continue to exist because they both have side-effects other than their effects on the car’s center-of-mass motion. The force acting between the cable and the car continues to produce tension in the cable and keep the cable taut. Earth’s gravitational force continues to keep the passengers (whom we are considering as part of the elevator-object) stuck to the floor and to produce internal stresses in the walls of the car, which must hold up the floor.\n\nThe situation for a skydiver is exactly analogous. It’s just that the skydiver experiences perhaps a million times more gravitational force than the feather, and it is not until she is falling very fast that the force of air friction becomes as strong as the gravitational force. It takes her several seconds to reach terminal velocity, which is on the order of a hundred miles per hour.\n\nIt is too constraining to restrict our attention to cases where all the forces lie along the line of the center of mass’s motion. For one thing, we cannot analyze any case of horizontal motion, since any object on Earth will be subject to a vertical gravitational force! For instance, when you are driving your car down a straight road, there are both horizontal forces and vertical forces. However, the vertical forces have no effect on the center of mass motion, because the road’s upward force simply counteracts Earth’s downward gravitational force and keeps the car from sinking into the ground.\n\nThe following slight generalization of Newton’s first law allows us to analyze a great many cases of interest:\n\nSuppose that an object has two sets of forces acting on it, one set along the line of the object’s initial motion and another set perpendicular to the first set. If both sets of forces cancel, then the object’s center of mass continues in the same state of motion.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between faith and religion?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Times when religion played a major role in the lives of the majority of people living in Europe and the United States have gone long ago. Nowadays, religion is just one of the social institutions (perhaps, even facultative institutions) performing certain functions, namely providing moral guidance and consolation to those who seek them. The same cannot be said about faith in its relation to the transcendent; faith in God, or in a higher power, or whatever else, is probably a much more influential aspect of modern life than it is widely believed. Even atheists have faith in something. At the same time, it turns out that many people tend to confuse these two terms, substituting them with each other. Therefore, it is important to distinguish the line between them.\n\nLet us start with religion. According to the Merriam-Webster online dictionary, the word “religion” has three definitions: 1) the belief in a god or in a group of gods; 2) an organized system of beliefs, ceremonies, and rules used to worship a god or a group of gods; 3) an interest, a belief, or an activity that is very important to a person or group (Merriam-Webster.com). Dictionary.com defines religion as “a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, especially when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs” (Dictionary.com). If we carefully analyze these definitions and combine them by a main criteria, the definition of religion would look like as follows: “Religion is a set of authoritative rules, dogmas, and rituals explaining the Universe in terms of supernatural powers, and organized in a harmonious system recognized by a group of people.”\n\nAs we can see, this definition considers the main aspects of any religion: authority, organization, and a reference to transcendence. This is what allows us to speak of religion as mostly a social institution. Now, let us pay attention to faith.\n\nOnce again, according to Merriam-Webster, faith is, “1) belief and trust in and loyalty to God; 2)  belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion; 3) firm belief in something for which there is no proof; 4) complete trust, something that is believed especially with strong conviction; especially:  a system of religious beliefs” (Merriam-Webster). Oxford Dictionaries define faith as “strong belief in the doctrines of a religion, based on spiritual conviction rather than proof” (Oxford Dictionaries). Finally, Dictionary.com generally defines faith as belief that is not based on proof.\n\nSumming up these definitions up, we can define faith as a belief or a system of various beliefs (including religious ones) which a person accepts and exercises without any additional proof of their truthfulness.\n\nAs we can see from the definitions provided above, religion requires faith, otherwise those who confess a religion would sooner or later start analyzing and questioning the fundamental dogmas underlying it. In its turn, faith—although being a natural component of any religion—does not necessarily relate to transcendence, divinity, or mystics; in fact, a person can believe in anything they want to believe. Whereas religion (given it is a conventional religion—Christianity, Islam, or Buddhism—or its commonly-recognized branches) necessarily provides moral guidance, serving as a beacon to those who seek comfort and direction, faith can relate to almost anything, and thus does not guarantee a person’s morality.\n\nFor example, a person can believe that God, even if it exists, is indifferent, and thus will watch over a person and/or punish him or her for violating commandments; therefore, for this person, everything is morally acceptable since they believe there will be no punishment following his or her actions. Or, a person can believe Jesus was a woman, or their deceased relatives guide and guard him/her as spirits (as in the Japanese Shintoism), and so on.\n\nGenerally speaking, religion is more about mass character and embedding oneself into a system of commonly-recognized theses and rituals, and faith is more of an individual, personal act, and does not necessarily correspond with existing norms (although mostly it does). An individual’s faith in something may change over time, or change its object; religions change extremely seldom, and the three major world religions are proof of this thesis. It does not mean, however, that any of these two are better or worse than the other one; both faith and religion can make people heroes and saints (like Jesus or Buddha), or force them to do horrible things (the Inquisition). A religion often provides its followers with proofs of dogmas: bleeding or crying icons, walking on burning coals, and so on; faith does not require any proof, and is something a person may believe in against all rational, logic, and common sense arguments.\n\nIn evaluating the differences between faith and religion, it is important to emphasize mass character and the organizational aspect of any religion. A religion is mainly a social institution, a form of organizing people’s way of thinking, and manipulating them (in all the meanings of this word) and constantly empowering its influence by providing proof for its dogmas. Faith is more individual, irrational (meaning that a person may believe in something without ever looking for a proof for their beliefs), and does not necessarily correspond with the conventional moral and ethical values. Therefore, considering all the aforementioned, although the terms “faith” and “religion” sometimes intersect closely, they are not interchangeable, and should be used with attention.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between light and matter?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Given for one instant an intelligence which could comprehend all the forces by which nature is animated and the respective positions of the things which compose it… nothing would be uncertain, and the future as the past would be laid out before its eyes.\n\n– Pierre Simon de Laplace\n\nPhysics is the use of the scientific method to find out the basic principles governing light and matter, and to discover the implications of those laws. Part of what distinguishes the modern outlook from the ancient mindset is the assumption that there are rules by which the universe functions, and that those laws can be at least partially understood by humans. From the Age of Reason through the nineteenth century, many scientists began to be convinced that the laws of nature not only could be known but, as claimed by Laplace, those laws could in principle be used to predict everything about the universe’s future if complete information was available about the present state of all light and matter.\n\nMatter can be defined as anything affected by gravity, i.e., that has weight or would have weight if it was near Earth or another star or planet massive enough to produce measurable gravity. Light can be defined as anything that can travel from one place to another through empty space and can influence matter, but has no weight. For example, sunlight can influence your body by heating it or by damaging your DNA and giving you skin cancer. The physicist’s definition of light includes a variety of phenomena that are not visible to the eye, including radio waves, microwaves, x-rays, and gamma rays. These are the “colors” of light that do not happen to fall within the narrow violet-to-red range of the rainbow that we can see.\n\nMany physical phenomena are not themselves light or matter, but are properties of light or matter or interactions between light and matter. For instance, motion is a property of all light and some matter, but it is not itself light or matter. The pressure that keeps a bicycle tire blown up is an interaction between the air and the tire. Pressure is not a form of matter in and of itself. It is as much a property of the tire as of the air. Analogously, sisterhood and employment are relationships among people but are not people themselves.\n\nSome things that appear weightless actually do have weight, and so qualify as matter. Air has weight, and is thus a form of matter even though a cubic inch of air weighs less than a grain of sand. A helium balloon has weight, but is kept from falling by the force of the surrounding more dense air, which pushes up on it. Astronauts in orbit around Earth have weight, and are falling along a curved arc, but they are moving so fast that the curved arc of their fall is broad enough to carry them all the way around Earth in a circle. They perceive themselves as being weightless because their space capsule is falling along with them, and the floor therefore does not push up on their feet.\n\nEinstein predicted as a consequence of his theory of relativity that light would after all be affected by gravity, although the effect would be extremely weak under normal conditions. His prediction was borne out by observations of the bending of light rays from stars as they passed close to the sun on their way to Earth. Einstein’s theory also implied the existence of black holes, stars so massive and compact that their intense gravity would not even allow light to escape (these days, there is strong evidence that black holes exist).\n\nEinstein’s interpretation was that light does not really have mass, but that energy is affected by gravity just like mass is. The energy in a light beam is equivalent to a certain amount of mass, given by the famous equation E=mc2, where c is the speed of light. Because the speed of light is such a big number, a large amount of energy is equivalent to only a very small amount of mass, so the gravitational force on a light ray can be ignored for most practical purposes.\n\nThere is however a more satisfactory and fundamental distinction between light and matter, which should be understandable to you if you have had a chemistry course. In chemistry, one learns that electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which forbids more than one electron from occupying the same orbital if they have the same spin. The Pauli exclusion principle is obeyed by the subatomic particles of which matter is composed, but disobeyed by the particles, called photons, of which a beam of light is made.\n\nThe boundary between physics and the other sciences is not always clear. For instance, chemists study atoms and molecules, which are what matter is built from, and there are some scientists who would be equally willing to call themselves physical chemists or chemical physicists. It might seem that the distinction between physics and biology would be clearer, since physics seems to deal with inanimate objects. In fact, almost all physicists would agree that the basic laws of physics that apply to molecules in a test tube work equally well for the combination of molecules that constitutes a bacterium (some might believe that something more happens in the minds of humans, or even those of cats and dogs). What differentiates physics from biology is that many of the scientific theories that describe living things, while ultimately resulting from the fundamental laws of physics, cannot be rigorously derived from physical principles.\n\nTo avoid having to study everything at once, scientists isolate the things they are trying to study. For instance, a physicist who wants to study the motion of a rotating gyroscope would probably prefer that it be isolated from vibrations and air currents. Even in biology, where field work is indispensable for understanding how living things relate to their entire environment, it is interesting to note the vital historical role played by Darwin’s study of the Galápagos Islands, which were conveniently isolated from the rest of the world. Any part of the universe that is considered apart from the rest can be called a “system.”\n\nPhysics has had some of its greatest successes by carrying this process of isolation to extremes, subdividing the universe into smaller and smaller parts. Matter can be divided into atoms, and the behavior of individual atoms can be studied. Atoms can be split apart into their constituent neutrons, protons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons appear to be made out of even smaller particles called quarks, and there have even been some claims of experimental evidence that quarks have smaller parts inside them. This method of splitting things into smaller and smaller parts and studying how those parts influence each other is called reductionism. The hope is that the seemingly complex rules governing the larger units can be better understood in terms of simpler rules governing the smaller units. To appreciate what reductionism has done for science, it is only necessary to examine a 19th-century chemistry textbook. At that time, the existence of atoms was still doubted by some, electrons were not even suspected to exist, and almost nothing was understood of what basic rules governed the way atoms interacted with each other in chemical reactions. Students had to memorize long lists of chemicals and their reactions, and there was no way to understand any of it systematically. Today, the student only needs to remember a small set of rules about how atoms interact, for instance that atoms of one element cannot be converted into another via chemical reactions, or that atoms from the right side of the periodic table tend to form strong bonds with atoms from the left side.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between Cyberpunk and other genres of science fiction?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " By Eric Mitchell, edited In the near, plausible future, the world has been transformed dramatically by the computer age, but not necessarily in the way the world had hoped. Enter the realm of Cyberpunk. Coldly defined by WordNet as “a genre of fast-paced science fiction involving oppressive computerized societies,” Cyberpunk (here capitalized for reverence) is a genre that is part Star Wars and part Sam Spade (Wordnet). It exists in a world that is real, yet unreal—familiar, yet foreign. It is a gritty world, lived-in, unpolished, unashamed of its true nature, and because of that, it is beautiful.\n\nCyberpunk is nearly universally dystopian. William Gibson’s Neuromancer is an excellent example and is held up by critics and myself as the quintessential Cyberpunk novel (Cumming 2014). With a gritty all‑too-plausible feel full of gangsters and mistrust, it shows just how dark the world can remain even with computers running the show. Data thieves work their magic for the highest bidder and pray they do not get caught. Disenfranchised heroes fight the established order imposed by corrupt governments, greedy corporations, and sleazy crime bosses. Cities rule the landscape. Giant metropolises whose severe industrial beauty and colorful lights beat back the night. Again, it is already happening, and again it is beautiful.\n\nOverall, Cyberpunk does not portray technology itself as evil, though exceptions occur. Rather, it serves to emphasize the point that is not the technology that is evil but the “Human behind the Machine” that harbors evil (What is Cyberpunk? | Neon Dystopia). The point is that machines amplify human potential and that the potential for evil can be amplified just as much as the potential for good. Cyberpunk evokes a spookiness rather than the hopeful optimistic feel of such science-fiction as Star Trek or even Stargate SG-1; a cautionary tone that warns not to put all of society’s eggs in the basket of computer technology. In more than a few Cyberpunk societies, “Big Brother” watches all and human rights are tossed aside. The government and corporations hold much of the power. The scariest part is that this sort of thing can indeed come to pass given today’s paranoia and level of technology. Already it is extremely easy for governments to track a person’s every move. Companies and schools do it all the time in cyberspace, tracking all Internet traffic in and out. Governments can do it quite easily through cars and cell phones and all manner of everyday objects that give away their position—even credit and debit cards.\n\nIn some cases, a Cyberpunk society is run entirely by an artificial intelligence, or A.I. Such is the case with The Matrix, where after taking over all of the “hard” things, they began to oppress humans, eventually relegating them to being a source of power, plugged into a digital recreation of Earth at the turn of the 21st century (The Matrix Trilogy). There are heroes and rebels that resist the machines, believing that they are acting on their own accord. This resistance culminates in the finding of the One who is able to see the Matrix for what it really is, and thus “defeat” the machines. However, this is actually how the machines solved a peculiar software bug in the Matrix and so they are aware of it and set the situation up in such a way that the One must make a choice that will either save an individual, or all of humanity. This series artfully blends typical Cyberpunk themes of hacking and large, advanced cybernetic technology with deeper thoughts on predestination and the purpose of choice.\n\nThe whole Cyberpunk aesthetic is based around the sleek industrial feel of modern technology—valuing the artificial over the natural. It also is evocative of the early computer. Little mention of graphical computer interfaces is made, preferring instead either fully virtual interfaces that are “plugged” directly into one’s brain, or the traditional command line terminal interfaces of the 1970s through the early 1990s which, to modern readers, can seem as anachronistic. This “bright lights, big city, sleek technology” aesthetic is a cornerstone of the genre. This is easily seen in the film Blade Runner, based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. It showcases this competently, as does the anime Ghost In the Shell—both of which have heavy emphasis on transhuman themes of cybernetics, which a group of people today embrace. Transhumanism revolves around melding humans with machines so that humans will be stronger and live longer and healthier than ever before, plugged into the Internet directly through his or her own consciousness.\n\nIn reality, Cyberpunk is an entire subculture that embraces technology and all the good it can bring when used properly and openly available—a set of ideals and morals and aesthetic principles that form a way of life for many people. The center of these values is open access to information. There should never be a small group that holds the power lest disaster strikes. It challenges the idea that computers should be limited in access and information available only to those with certain resources. Many of the participants in this community are themselves hackers of one fashion or another who use their knowledge for good. They bring data and information to light that once was hidden and share it with the community so that everyone can know. A simple and recent example is that a group of hackers managed to uncover information about the Chinese Olympic women’s gymnastics team: the gymnasts were underage. It supposedly prompted an investigation into the matter.\n\nThe artistic elements behind Cyberpunk are both elusive and undeniable in their obviousness. Such fantastic visions are visually appealing so long as form follows function. Bright lights and colorful signs, the beautiful, fantastic virtual representations of computer networks, are full worlds unto themselves. Authors in the vein of William Gibson, Phillip K. Dick, and Neal Stephenson grasp this quite well.  It can already be seen in real world places. It is the plausibility of it all that makes it so stunning. The idea of ubiquitous computing and media.  The idea that governments and corporations and industrious individuals can easily compromise one’s privacy. A perfect but little known example is the push for what is called “cloud computing” where an individual’s data is not stored locally on hardware they own (and therefore are covered under legal protections) but stored on a company’s server. They can spy on everything you do, stop you if they find what you are doing or learning to be unsavory. The authorities need only subpoena the company and they would turn over all your data without batting an eye to protect themselves from legal trouble. The whole genre serves as an eloquent reminder to consider what technology is and how can be used to stay away from the evils that lie down the road of improper usage. Care must be taken, because with the great power technology holds comes the greater responsibility to use it to benefit humankind.###"}
{"prompt": "What is anhedonia?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Though depression is a severe psychiatric disease, rather often people use the term “depression” to describe an upset mood. They also tend to understand depression as the lack of positive emotions, or an inability to feel joyful. However, by doing this, they substitute depression for one of its symptoms, which is called anhedonia.\n\nThe term “anhedonia” comes from the Greek words a- (which means “not,” “without”), and hedone (“pleasure”). Hence, the most general definition based on etymology would let us define anhedonia as the absence of pleasure. However, this phenomenon is more complicated.\n\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster Online dictionary, anhedonia is a person’s inability to feel pleasure from activities that usually produces it. It does not mean a person, for example, enjoyed playing football, and then lost interest in this activity and switched to something else. A person with anhedonia literally cannot feel pleasure or joy from what they like to do. In its turn, this may lead to more serious consequences, because anhedonia breaks the stimuli-reward mechanism.\n\nPerhaps a more precise definition would point out that anhedonia does not let a person feel pleasure from normally enjoyable activities. This means a person does not feel enthusiastic not only about a specific hobby, but about everything that is usually considered enjoyable: sex, music, humor, social communication and interaction, and so on. For example, a mother with anhedonia could feel that playing with her child does not make her happy (MedicineNet.com).\n\nYet another definition supposes that anhedonia does not necessarily mean one’s incapability of joy and happiness. Instead, it assumes anhedonistic people cannot sustain their positive emotions about certain events that cause them (Psychology Today). From this viewpoint, anhedonia is characterized by the superficiality of positive emotions. For example, if an anhedoniac person had a romantic evening and then kissed their passion for the first time, the delight from this event would be weak, and would last only for a couple of minutes. However, personally I would question this definition, as individuals have varying degrees of intensiveness when it comes to emotional reactions.\n\nBased on the material listed above, anhedonia can be defined as a symptom of depression that is characterized by an individual’s inability to feel pleasure from their hobbies, or activities that are usually considered joyful (such as communication, sex, playing with their children, and so on). Though there exist definitions that mark anhedonia as a decreased sustainability of positive feelings, I would disagree with it, as people do not share the same levels of intensiveness of their emotional reactions; according to this definition, those who feel superficial joy instead of full-scale delight could be considered anhedoniac. Anhedonia is easy to confuse with depression, but these two terms are different.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the benefits of adoption?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In the past, children were raised mostly by their biological parents. In the rare case they were not, they had either to survive on the streets or live in orphanages. However, times have changed, and today children can be raised in single-parent families, by grandparents, foster parents, stepparents, or other parenting figures—all this is due to the procedure of adoption, which has become common worldwide. However, the occurrence of adoption has a number of features that distinguish it from a simple residence of a child in a family.\n\nAdoption is a way to provide parenting care to children whose biological mothers and fathers have no opportunities or wish to take care of them. It is a procedure that establishes a lifelong legally-recognized relationship between an adoptive parent and a child. In such case, a parenting figure takes on all the responsibilities of the adopted child’s safety, education, healthcare, development of life skills, welfare, and other factors regarding to the child (CHS).\n\nOnce an adoption has been granted to guardian parents, it can no longer be reversed; stated succinctly, guarded parents cannot refuse to take further care of a child they have decided to take from an orphanage or elsewhere. In their turn, after being adopted, children lose their former legal boundaries with their biological parents, and become full members of their adopted families, usually taking their last name (Royal Greenwich). Adopted children are also granted the same rights and privileges (including the right of inheritance) as if they were biological children of guardian parents (Niderect).\n\nThere can exist different kinds of adoption procedures. In particular, in Canada, four types of adoption are recognized: private, public, international, and relative adoption. By private adoption, birth or expectant parents are connected with a possible guardian family with the help of an adoption professional; public adoption implies arranging a connection with aspiring guardian parents through specialized organizations; international adoption implies adopting a child from another country. Finally, relative adoption means adopting a child by a stepparent or another close relative: grandparents, uncles, cousins, and so on (Adoption Council of Ontario).\n\nIn order to be able to become an guardian parent, a person should match certain criteria. Usually adoption agencies require candidate parents to be at least 21, but other factors are individual, meaning that agencies analyze each applicant’s circumstances on a case-by-case basis (Nidirect).\n\nAdoption is a way for children who have no parents to feel the benefits of parental care. It is a legal procedure that implies that guardian parents take the responsibility of an adopted child. In their turn, adopted children have the same rights and privileges as if they were biological children of guardian parents. This procedure has different types, including adoption of foreign children or adoption by close relatives; but, regardless of the type, it cannot be reversed.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the definition of humor?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " There are many sayings, proverbs, and scientific studies claiming and proving that having a sense of humor is a phenomenal aid in various life situations. However, what one finds funny may be dull and boring for another. Some people value only black humor, while others may find comedic features literally in everything. In other words, there seems to be no universal criteria to define what exactly is humorous.\n\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster online dictionary, humor is a quality that appeals to one’s sense of the ludicrous or absurdly incongruous. In other words, this definition implies that humor is a personal quality that causes us to feel amused as we witness events or phenomena that fall into the category of absurd. The ridiculousness of absurdity, by the way, to some extent corresponds with Freud’s views on the sense of humor, but at the same time, does not seem to give us a clear picture.\n\nThe online Free Dictionary defines humor as situations, speeches, or writings that are thought to be humorous. This definition reminds us about jokes and comedy—genres that are most often associated with the sense of humor. However, a word or an event on their own cannot be funny, as it is the context that provokes our amusement about something. This assumes the same joke spoken to different people, who are either familiar or not familiar with its context, will respectively be perceived by them as ridiculous or dull and meaningless.\n\nDictionary.com offers a definition, according to which humor is a comic, absurd, or incongruous quality that causes amusement. If we restate this definition, we can see it assumes that for a situation or phenomenon to be seen as funny, it is enough for them to be absurd or incongruous. We believe it is the participant who evaluates each particular situation, so we cannot ignore the role of an individual. In fact, this definition is to some extent similar to the one above in terms of appealing only to an object without taking the participant into consideration.\n\nBased on the aforementioned qualities, but seemingly incomplete definitions, we would like to come up with another one. Humor is the individual’s ability to perceive situations or phenomena as amusing due to their absurd, incongruous, or ludicrous nature, and/or in relation to the context in which they took place.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the definition of cruel and unusual punishment?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When studying law, students often encounter the term “cruel and unusual punishment.” It is used in the VIII amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which says that “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted.” In fact, this amendment is needed to guarantee an individual’s rights enshrined in the Constitution even after a person has been accused of committing a crime and convicted. However, since it is awkward out of context, and for better understanding, the meaning of the term “cruel and unusual punishment” should be analyzed and defined more clearly.\n\nThere is no universal definition for the term “cruel and unusual punishment.” Generally, any punishment that can be seen as inhumane and violates human dignity can fall under this category; for example, in 1995, a federal court in Massachusetts considered convicts held in a 150-year-old prison to be treated in a humiliating way and found their rights being infringed upon (Findlaw). Meanwhile, in times when the term “cruel and unusual punishment” was introduced, much harsher forms of punishment than today were practiced around Europe and even the U.S.: starting from whipping and banishment for larceny, and ending up with crucifixion or breaking on the wheel (Nolo). The latter, though, was always seen by American courts as excessive and inherently cruel.\n\nIn order to come up with a concrete definition, the U.S. Supreme Court has offered to consider a form of punishment as cruel and unusual depending on the “evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society (Rutherford Institute).” In other words, considering that each period of time in societal life is remarkable with its dominating values and norms of morals that are constantly changing, the understanding of what is cruel and unusual may differ. According to the Free Dictionary, cruel and unusual punishment is a penalty which is torturing, or degrading, such which is not known to the common law or any fine, penalty, confinement, or treatment that is so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the moral sense of the community (Free Dictionary).\n\nAmong the examples of cruel and unusual punishments (found in American courts), one could possibly name: execution of those who are insane or mentally retarded; a 56-year term for forging checks totaling less than $500; handcuffing a prisoner to a horizontal bar exposed to the sun for several hours; criminal prosecution of a homeless or chronic alcoholic person for public intoxication, and other examples from real court practices (Nolo).\n\nCruel and unusual punishment is mentioned in the VIII amendment of the U.S. Constitution; its purposed amendment is to guarantee an individual’s rights and protect their dignity even after conviction. A punishment can be classified as cruel and unusual depending on the current standards of dignity, adopted in a society; in general, this is a punishment that is disproportionate to the offense and shocks the moral sense of the community.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between impeachment and removal from office?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " On October 16, calls for the impeachment of U.S. President Barack Obama sounded once again. Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, and Texas Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst called Obama’s recent political moves impeachable, and thus made their calls (Washington Times). However, as practice shows, many people confuse the procedure of impeachment with an official’s removal from office. Since an impeachment is an act that affects an entire country’s life, several clarifications need to be made to avoid such confusion of terms.\n\nAccording to the online Free Dictionary by Farlex, the verb “to impeach,” from which the discussed term comes from, means “to make an accusation against.” This word can be traced back to the Anglo-Norman word empecher, as well as to the late Latin “impedicare.” Both of these words mean “to catch,” or “to entangle.” The Middle English word “empechen” means “to criticize unfavorably.” As for its legal sense, this word was first used in the 14th century in the context of accusation and bringing charges against an official (The Free Dictionary).\n\nIn its modern meaning, impeachment means charging a public official before a competent tribunal with misconduct in office (Merriam-Webster). However, as practice shows, many people misunderstand this term; they presume that impeachment means an official’s (particularly, the President’s) removal from their office. Impeachment could be defined as a procedure of accusing an official of a certain misconduct and, in relation with this, claiming distrust in them, but without a necessary removal of this official from his or her respective office. According to Article II of the Constitution of the United States, among such misconducts are treason, bribery, and other high crimes.\n\nAt the same time, for the U.S. President to be removed from office, a majority of the House of Representatives must vote on the Articles of Impeachment, which is almost the same as a prosecution for a crime. The actual removal from the office can occur only when two-thirds of the Senate vote for it. The history of the U.S. has cases when Presidents have been impeached, but were still not removed from their cabinets (Washington Times).\n\nImpeachment today is a contentious topic for America. Several officials—the former governor of Alaska and the current Lieutenant Governor of Texas have called for an impeachment of the U.S. President Barack Obama. However, impeachment does not necessarily mean removal of an official from office. Impeachment is a procedure of accusing an official of a certain misconduct and, in relation with this, claiming distrust in them. The removal from the office, however, can occur only when two-thirds of the Senate vote for it on the initiative of the House of Representatives.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the meaning of addiction?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " We hear the word “addiction” passed around by our friends, the media, and our families. Specialists—such as sociologists or psychologists—constantly reveal new forms of addiction, referring to various kinds of activities. Besides such omnipresent forms as addiction to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or gambling, today experts also have distinguished addictions to the Internet, mobile technologies, computer games, work, sex, television, caffeine, and many subjects. Sometimes people confuse the meaning of the term “addiction” and may use it to indicate their habitual activities, or hobbies. Yet, not any repeated behavior is a manifestation of addiction. Therefore, the meaning of this term should be clarified.\n\nThe forming of an addiction does not imply a unique mechanism of getting used to particular occupations or substances. On the contrary, experts often distinguish psychological and physical aspects of addiction. They can be interconnected (as in the case of alcohol or drug addiction), or be manifested without interconnection (Internet addiction). In other words, when talking about addiction, we should mind it can either refer to a substance dependence or behavioral malfunctions.\n\nWhat is a psychological or behavioral addiction then? According to the website of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, it is a chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry, which is reflected in an individual pathologically pursuing reward and/or relief by performing certain actions (ASAM). The Collins English Dictionary defines addiction as a condition of being abnormally dependent on a certain habit. Psychological addiction is followed by such symptoms as an individual becoming obsessed with an object or activity; engaging in the activity or habitual behavior even if it is potentially harming; denying problems connected to the addiction and hiding the addictive behavior from others; and several others (Indiana University). Therefore, based on the aforementioned statements, we can say psychological addiction is a pathological condition of the mind, which is characterized by an excessive dependency or obsession on a certain object or action and ignoring the potential dangers of addictive behavior.\n\nThe physical aspect of an addiction is characterized with a continued use of certain substances even when significant problems related to their use develop (Wexner Medical Center). As a result, bodies of such addicts cannot tolerate without new doses of drugs, alcohol, etc. Since people with an addiction (substance dependence in particular) have little or no control over their obsessions (Medical News Today), physical addiction can be defined as a constant need to intake certain substances to satisfy one’s craving, even though this may be harmful for the addict, who often is unable to control the craving.\n\nCombining the two definitions we have distilled, we can define the phenomenon of addiction as a mind pathology characterized by an obsession of certain actions, objects, or substances, which brings addicts temporary satisfaction while often being harmed by them, but over which they have little or no control.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the causes of OCDs?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I think people who are not too educated in psychology—and supposedly, they make a majority—think that psychological disorders must manifest themselves in anti-social behavior, strange passions, autistic behavior, or in any other similar way. But what if many of the people around us, whom we consider normal, even our friends and family members, actually suffer from psychological disorders? What if they are obsessed and locked-up in the prison of their own minds? What I am talking about here is called an OCD: an obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nThe term OCD consists of two defining words: obsession and compulsion. As the word “disorder” speaks for itself, defining obsession and compulsion is crucial for understanding this problem. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, obsession is a persistent disturbing preoccupation with an often unreasonable idea or feeling. Compulsion, in its turn, is an irresistible, persistent impulse to perform an act—often to deal with the obsession. An OCD can be defined as a condition of the mind characterized by a constantly repeating intrusive idea or thought, which can be neutralized only by a certain act or ritual.\n\nReasons standing behind a particular OCD can be numerous. One of the latest research studies points to genetics, brain abnormalities, life events, parenting and upbringing, and even infections (NHS). Forms OCDs can take are also numerous, though generally they can be classified under such categories as checking, contamination, hoarding, and intrusive thoughts. People with a checking OCD constantly check domestic appliances, windows, car doors, and so on. A contamination OCD often manifests itself in an individual’s urgent need to wash his or her hands or body and to avoid “dirty” items. Hoarding OCD often prevents people from throwing away objects, even those that are unnecessary. OCDs connected to intrusive thoughts make individuals fear their own inappropriate thoughts.\n\nIt is important to mention that people with an OCD never (or rarely) do or experience what they are afraid of. For example, people who have intrusive violent or sexual thoughts are the least likely to act on these thoughts, partly because they find them so frightening and “wrong.” It also refers to people who have obsessions to check items and domestic appliances: because they are so attentive, these people are unlikely to cause fire, flood, or other property or health damage. OCD fears can be fairly called irrational. Nevertheless, OCDs consume excessive amounts of time, cause significant distress and anguish, and interfere in daily functioning (OCD-UK). Successful treatment is possible, but in most cases, OCD-sufferers cannot deal with their fears on their own, and need professional help.\n\nAn OCD is not an anti-social psychological disorder. On the contrary, many people with OCDs are less likely to harm people or to be inaccurate and negligent. An OCD is a permanent state of mind in which a person has constantly repeating intrusive ideas or thoughts, which people with an OCD believe can only be neutralized by certain acts or rituals. Unfortunately, these people continue to suffer from their irrational fears and have to repeat their rituals to calm down. Fears or obsessive thoughts that disturb such individuals most often fall into such categories as checking, contamination, hoarding, or ruminating. Reasons behind OCDs are numerous, and include genetics, brain abnormalities, life events, parenting and upbringing, and infections. The good news is that OCDs can be successfully treated with the help of competent specialists.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the definition of justice?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Individuals are different in terms of their opportunities, physical and mental capabilities, financial and social statuses, and by other criteria. At the same time, most people live in societies—therefore norms regulating interactions and behavior in societies were developed. Historically, these norms were often beneficial for the few privileged members of a society, while other people had to deal with mistreatment and violations. This is where the concept of justice comes in. Philosophers were looking for a form of rule, or for a social organization that would embrace and satisfy the interests of all members of a society. Some of these philosophers—such as Plato, for example—saw justice in public ownership of all goods produced within a community; others believed an access to goods should be provided in accordance to the contribution a person had made to social affairs. It may seem paradoxical, but even now the concept and the understanding of justice is debated.\n\nAccording to Dictionary.com, justice is synonymous to such concepts as righteousness, lawfulness, and equality. As an ethical category, justice can be defined as a principle of fairness, according to which similar cases should be treated alike, and a punishment should be proportionate to the offense; the same refers to rewards for achievements. The Merriam-Webster Online dictionary defines justice as an impartial adjustment of conflicting claims or the assignment of merited rewards or punishments; the establishment or determination of rights according to the rules of law or equity. As a broader meaning, justice is defined as a conformity to the ideal of just or right doing.\n\nJustice in its legal and ethical perspective can be defined as acting according to the ideal of fair-doing recognized in a particular society, and treating a person or his or her doings in accordance to this ideal and state laws. At the same time, justice, law, and norms are not equivalent; for example, a punishment for a crime judged fairly according to the existing laws does not necessarily look fair in the eyes of public, as it was in Anders Breivik’s case. Breivik, the Norwegian terrorist who killed 77 people in July, 2011, was sentenced to 21 years of imprisonment (The New York Times), which is unfairly unequal to the scale of the crime he committed.\n\nReferring to justice in its socioeconomic aspect, it is rather difficult to provide an unequivocal definition, as most of them are closely connected to various political and economic doctrines. Simply put, justice can be defined as a way of allocating and distributing material and intangible benefits (such as education, employment opportunities, access to political life) in a society in a way that does not infringe or insult any individual.\n\nJustice is a concept which can be understood in different ways, especially in its socioeconomic perspective. Also, justice can be defined as acting according to the ideal of fair-doing recognized in a particular society, and treating a person or their doings in accordance to this ideal and state laws. In its economical aspect, justice is a way of distributing material and intangible goods in a way that does not insult anyone. As you can see, justice is multifaceted.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some ways to deal with workplace discrimination?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In an ideal world, people would be equal in rights, opportunities, and responsibilities, despite their race or gender. In the world we live in, however, we constantly face all kinds of neglect based on different attributes. All over the world, certain people treat others with prejudice because of particular features they possess. Unfortunately, this happens even in places which, by definition, should be free of all personal prejudices—specifically, in offices and other business surroundings. This phenomenon is called workplace discrimination; not every unfair behavior at work, however, can be assessed as discrimination.\n\nWhat exactly is workplace discrimination? It can be defined as a less favorable treatment towards an individual or a group of individuals at work, usually based on their nationality, skin color, sex, marital status, age, trade union activity, or other defining attributes (Australian Human Rights Commission). It can appear as a denial of certain rights, negligent treatment, intentional underestimating of a worker’s personality or work results and achievements, and so on. A person can be discriminated by their employers, or by their coworkers as well. Discrimination can result into severe psychological consequences for the victim, such as emotional stress and anxiety. Discrimination often causes an employee to leave the workplace, resign from a position, or in severe cases, to commit suicide, or act violently against the discriminators.\n\nWorkplace discrimination can take more open and threatening forms, which are known as workplace harassment. It occurs when an employee is made to feel intimidated, insulted, or humiliated, based on such features as race, ethnic origin, gender, physical or mental disability, or on any other characteristic specified under legislation (AHRC). The two most radical forms of workplace harassment are the application of physical violence or sexual harassment—women are especially exposed to this kind of discrimination. Workplace violence can take several forms: the direct exercise of physical force against a worker which causes or could cause injuries to the worker; an attempt to exercise physical force; or a statement or behavior which a worker can reasonably interpret as a threat to exercise physical force (Ontario Ministry of Labor). Sexual harassment can take the form of obscene jokes and allusions; intrusive body contact; inappropriate gestures, or even direct actions aimed at sexual contact.\n\nThere are several ways to deal with workplace discrimination; such measures can be held both on the individual and on the collective level. Individuals who have experienced discrimination or harassment at work are recommended to stand firm under verbal attacks, remain confident about their own abilities and judgments, and try not to stay alone with the abusive person (UnionSafe). At the same time, collective measures can be taken as well. They usually include calling for a meeting in a quiet, confidential place in order to admit and discuss the problem; complaining to competent authorities; developing respective policies together with sanctions applied in case there is an infringement enacted by workers.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world, and not all people can enjoy equal opportunities and rights. This refers not only to our personal lives, but to our working environment as well; employees can be discriminated and abused because of certain features they possess, such as the color of skin, their ethnicity or gender, age, marital status, disabilities, and so on. To eliminate workplace discrimination, both individual and collective preventive measures should be made.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the signs of emotional abuse in a relationship?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Most often, under the term domestic violence, people denote physical or sexual coercion; though this is a reasonable definition, domestic violence is a significantly wider term that requires clarification. Domestic violence is a narrower term for domestic abuse – a behavior pattern which implies controlling or dominating one person who is an intimate relationship, whether it be a partner, children, or relatives (Helpguide). It may have physical, emotional, sexual, and economic aspects, sometimes combining several of them simultaneously. The main purpose of such control is to completely suppress the partner’s will, and manipulate them. This is achieved by behavior that can be classified as frightening, intimidating, terrorizing, hurtful, humiliating, blaming, injuring, wounding, and so on (The Hotline).\n\nThere are several criteria for sexually or physically abusive behavior. Though it may seem that victims of domestic violence should be able to distinguish it, in reality many victims tend to perceive violent behavior as normal. Most of all, it refers to emotional and economic domestic violence, because they are more difficult to determine than physical or sexual abuse. For example, the signs of emotional abuse are: calling names, acting jealous and/or possessive, punishing by withholding affectation, threatening and humiliating (The Hotline). Financial abuse has the following signs: rigid control over a partner’s finances, withholding money and/or basic necessities (such as food, clothes, medications, or shelter), stealing, preventing a partner from working, and many other indicators (Helpguide).\n\nDomestic violence refers not only to women or children. Men suffer from it as well: mostly emotionally, though cases of physical violence are not rare as well. The main fact to comprehend about an abusive relationship is that the partner who acts as an aggressor will not change, and will not stop their insulting behavior. The best option for people who suffer from any kind of domestic violence is to break the relationship. It is useless to expect a certain behavior or opposition will calm the violent partner down.\n\nDomestic violence remains a significant social problem in many countries all over the world. Some of its forms are obvious (such as sexual or physical violence), while other are not so easy to distinguish. Such forms are emotional and financial abuse. Emotional abuse involves humiliating, threatening, and manipulating, while financial violence can express itself in a partner limiting the economic freedoms of their counterparts. The victims of domestic abuse should not expect improvements: the best option for them is to break away from their abusive relationship.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the differences between an introvert and an extrovert?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Today’s world values activity. People are assessed by how much they do, how they behave, how communicative they are, and how well they socialize. The active way of life is the undisputed desirable norm, and many people around the world take a high level of activity for granted—they never question it. However, there are also a group of people, who, due to their personality, feel uncomfortable about being excessively active. This personality type is known as an introvert. This term has come to be used as a synonym for grim, dull, or even asocial, and thus needs to be clarified, since introversion is not a pathology. Introverts have a different approach to life from the one that has been adopted as exemplary by mainstream culture.\n\nSo what is introversion? Merriam-Webster’s Online dictionary defines introversion as the state or tendency toward being wholly or predominantly concerned with and interested in one’s own mental life. Dictionary.com, among other meanings, defines introversion as being a shy. According to Charles Martin, an introvert is a person whose “energy comes from dealing with the ideas and reactions within one’s head, in the inner world” (Martin). Susan Cain says that, opposite to extroverts, “introverts prefer less stimulating environments and tend to enjoy quiet concentration, listen more than they talk, and think before they speak” (Cain).\n\nIn light of this, introversion can be defined as an individual’s tendency to concentrate and reflect on their own inner world, giving a priority to thinking over acting, and adhering to a comfortable environment. They prefer to spend more time on their own or with a couple of people they know well.\n\nIntroversion grants individuals with a set of features, which makes them completely different from the type of personality presented by extroverts. According to Cain, introverts prefer to limit their circles to a few acquaintances; however, they build extremely stable and long-lasting relationships (Cain); they tend to know people better than extroverts. Introverts become exhausted rather quickly by constant contact with other people.\n\nIntroverts often prefer to work alone as opposed to with a team. They do not take action as quickly as extroverts, and tend to ponder over a problem at hand before starting to solve it. However, due of this, they often foresee consequences that escape their extrovert counterparts, thus taking more effective actions and making more efficient decisions. Due to the peculiarities of their thinking process, introverts are often misunderstood by those around them; they are often believed to be detached and unemotional, though they might be simply thinking about their interlocutor’s words. They could be experiencing a real emotional storm inside, but show little of it on the outside.\n\nIntroversion is considered an aberration, but this is because modern societies have developed so many extroverts. According to Marty O. Laney, about 75% of people are extroverts (Laney). She also claims that personality types cannot be changed—only slight modifications are possible. This can seem upsetting, but in fact, it allows many people to feel comfortable with their introversion. They can stop trying to become someone they are not and learn how to live comfortably in the extroverts’ world.\n\nTherefore, introversion is not an aberration or pathology. In fact, it is a type of personality, possessed by approximately 25% of the world’s population, which involves a completely different way of thinking and functioning than is considered normal nowadays. Generally speaking, introversion is a tendency to concentrate on the inner world. Introverts often give priority to thinking over acting, and prefer to adhere to a comfortable environment. They are as sociable as extroverts, but choose to limit the number of people they associate with. They prefer instead to establish deeper relationships with fewer people. Being an introvert is a unique chance to look at the world from the other side, and there is no need for such individuals to try to be someone else.\n\nResources:\n1.

{"prompt": "What is chauvinism?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " We live in times of proclaimed tolerance towards a wide variety of world-outlooks, religions, occupations, and other activities in which modern people are engaged. To some extent, it simplifies communication as well as facilitates freedom and understanding between people. However, many ideas that were once considered normal are now misperceived as inappropriate, especially if they break from the smooth picture the ideology of general tolerance cultivates. On the other hand, lots of radical concepts find their place in the public mind. One such concept is chauvinism—a term used to characterize a number of negative social phenomena.\n\nIt is synonymous with prejudice of almost any kind. The term has its origins in the times of the Napoleonic wars (Hacus 231). Its appearance in language goes back to a French soldier named Nicolas Chauvin, who was known for his exaggerated patriotism. He remained a zealous supporter of Bonapartism, despite the fact that it had become quite unpopular during the Bourbon Restoration. Chauvin idolized the deposed Emperor, even being poor and disabled. His last name was used to create a term defining a specific outlook which he shared. However, later the term’s meaning broadened.\n\nThesaurus.com defines chauvinism as an “Extreme devotion to a belief, or nation.” According to Merriam-Webster online, chauvinism is an “Excessive or blind patriotism; undue partiality or attachment to a group or place to which one belongs or has belonged; an attitude of superiority toward members of the opposite sex.” Finally, on Dictionary.com, chauvinism is defined as “Zealous and aggressive patriotism or blind enthusiasm for military glory; biased devotion to any group, attitude, or cause; the denigration, disparagement, and patronization of either sex based on the belief that one sex is inferior to the other and thus deserving of less than equal treatment or benefit.” Based on the aforementioned definitions, chauvinism can be characterized as a blind attachment to a certain nation, religion, group of people, or sex, and an extreme prejudice against the members of opposite or different groups. Thus, a chauvinist is a person who shares these kinds of attachments and prejudices.\n\nThis concept is used when referring to nationalism and sexism. Chauvinism can be perceived as the ideology of proving and preaching the superiority of a certain nationality, which supposedly gives one nation a right to discriminate and oppress others. Chauvinism as nationalism lies close to a phenomenon of jingoism and is typical for many ultra-right organizations. Skinheads, Jingos, Chavs, and other radical nationalistic subcultures and movements can be called chauvinistic.\n\nOn the other hand, chauvinism as sexism refers both to males and females, as it assumes the belief in the superiority of one sex over the other. Male chauvinists believe women must stay at home, cook and raise children, while men are supposed to live an active life, build careers, and self-actualize (Iota 156). At the same time, some forms of modern feminism can be referred to as female chauvinism. For example, despite the fact that Islam strictly prohibits male chauvinism, Muslims are often considered disdainful in the way they treat their women, though this is not true with the majority of Muslims. Or on the contrary, women often furiously argue about the numerous advantages of women over men. This can also be called chauvinism.\n\nIt can be said that chauvinism is a phenomenon that can hardly be tolerated in the modern world. Though there exists a strong forbearance to numerous outlooks and ideologies in various societies, chauvinism cannot be accepted, since it implies hostility and supremacy towards groups with different values. Chauvinism is a term used to characterize intolerance based on nationality or gender, though it can also refer to other spheres of influence, such as religion or political ideology.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the definition of absurd?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The term absurd is used when an individual faces an occurrence that is beyond his or her comprehension, when he or she is anxious, or cannot deal with a certain issue (Fen 23). It would be rather fair to say that, in many cases, people avoid making the effort to understand a concept that is inexplicable, instead labeling the phenomenon as “absurd.” However, the term “absurd” can have a much deeper meaning than usually considered. It is actually a philosophical category that was widely used by the famous philosophers of the twentieth century—especially by the believers in the school of existentialism. Grasping its various aspects would be useful for the general reader, as well as for students who study philosophy.\n\nBefore proceeding to the definition of the term itself, it would be instructive to remember the ancient Greek myth about Sisyphus. According to its most widespread version, Sisyphus was a king and an erector of Corinth. He managed to deceive and seize Thanatos, the god of death. Due to the absence of Thanatos, people stopped dying and finally, the gods became worried about this fact. They sent the god of war, Ares, to free Thanatos, who wrested Sisyphus’ soul. As a punishment, Sisyphus was condemned to roll a heavy stone to the top of a high mountain. As soon as the stone reached the apex, it rolled to the foothill so that Sisyphus had to start from the beginning.\n\nThe punishment given to Sisyphus is often seen as the quintessence of absurd. Thus, it can be inferred that absurd means sudden, or that it does not fit in concrete logic. Merriam-Webster online gives several meanings for the word absurd: “1) ridiculously unreasonable, unsound, or incongruous; 2) having no rational, or orderly relationship to human life, lacking order, or value.” According to Dictionary.com, this term means utterly or obviously senseless, illogical, or untrue; contrary to all reason, or common sense; laughably foolish, or false.\n\nThis is how absurd can be understood on the common level. However, its philosophical meaning is more interesting and versatile. Thus, existentialism had generated the whole doctrine of absurdism, which characterizes the relationships between human beings, life and reality. This doctrine had developed after the world wars of the twentieth century, where millions of people had died and suffered, and various social disturbances occurred (fen 34).\n\nAbsurdism was studied by many famous philosophers like Albert Camus, who dedicated almost all his works to this topic. In the beginning, the myth about Sizif was mentioned. Camus’ most famous essay on the topic of the absurd was written exactly about Sizif. The philosopher sees absurd as a conflict—a confrontation between the human yearning for meaningfulness and clarity, and an indifferent universe free from guarantees. Therefore, one has three ways to deal with the absurd: committing suicide, performing a leap of faith, or accepting it. According to Camus, the latter is the only true way, which assumes a person understands that the universe is free from absolutes (Liam 221). Thus, a person as an individual is also truly free and possesses abilities and possibilities to create their own sense and purpose of existence.\n\nSoren Kierkegaard, another famous existentialist, comprehends absurd as a synonym to paradox. He defines it as a matter of faith and the only phenomena that allows a person to believe in self. According to his philosophy, a human being is a synthesis of opposites: eternal and temporary, finite and infinite, freedom and obligation. Due to the synthesis of these opposites in an individual’s consciousness, one constantly resides in fear and despair (Liam 194). And the more self-consciousness one possesses, the deeper these feelings are. The only way for salvation is faith in God and this is where absurd comes in. Kierkegaard refers to the biblical myth about Abraham and his son Isaac. According to this legend, God required Abraham to sacrifice his son to Him. In this case, Abraham’s faith led him to commit a crime; it transformed a murder into an act of charity and simultaneously, where faith had returned Isaac to his father alive. Faith cannot be logically argued, but it works and this is absurd. Individuals are free and this freedom lets them find their own way to God.\n\nWe can see the understanding of absurd is rather multi-faceted. Absurd does not necessarily mean hostile, useless, and deprived in any sense. In most cases, this term is still used to label certain phenomena and events as weird, incognizable, and unwanted—but at the same time, absurd can allow a person to find a meaning, an essence for which one is looking. Absurd contains a resolution, sometimes of a problem that was generated by itself. One might say that absurd possesses some sense, which is totally absurd.###"}
{"prompt": "What is codependency, and how is it often confused with love?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " During their lives, individuals follow several important concepts that play a significant role in their existence. Among the most common of them, success, well-being, and faith are prime examples. Another and perhaps one of the most ancient concepts is love. This word is one of the most widely-used in the world, although there are many sound reasons for the substitution of this concept when speaking of it. What is most confusing is the notion of “codependency,” which brings, in contradistinction to “love,” a harmful and morbid experience.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster online, codependency is a psychological condition or relationship in which a person is controlled or manipulated by another who is afflicted by a pathological condition. Dictionary.com defines codependency as a relationship in which one person is physically or psychologically addicted, for example, to alcohol or gambling. In addition, Oxforddictionaries.com offers the definition of codependency as an excessive, emotional, or psychological reliance on a partner, typically one with an illness, or addiction, who requires support.\n\nThese are the most common interpretations of codependency. As it can be observed, all of them contain several keywords: relationship, partner, dependence, addiction, or pathology, and characterize this state as “unhealthy.” At the same time, many psychologists claim that codependency is not just about being in a relationship with a person having an addiction, or who is mentally challenged. Research indicates that it is a state that is commonly mistaken for love and is typical in most relationships. Thus, 98% of grown-up Americans who are married or are in a romantic relationship are considered to be codependent (Weinhold 46). Actually, it does not matter whether one of the partners has a certain obsession, as codependency develops even between people who are free from bad habits.\n\nCodependency can be defined as a psychological state involving a heavy emotional reliance on a partner, characterized by excessive caring, a constant search of their acceptance and approval, and by painful experiences as a consequence. Among the latter, one can point to excessive and unjustified jealousy, repressed anger, unspoken resentment, and the feeling of abandonment. Codependency is considered to be the same kind of addiction as alcoholism and narcomania—the difference being that the object of the unwholesome passion is directed to another person. Codependent people often forget about their needs, interests and goals, sacrificing it all for the benefit of the partner they “love.” Stated succinctly, codependents make the relationship more important than themselves. For classic examples of this disease, one needs to look no further than Romeo and Juliette, Othello and Desdemona—or from the more recent past, Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen, as much less romantic, but still a codependent relationship.\n\nCodependency, which is sometimes called neurotic affection, is supported by a number of extremely powerful and enduring myths, which are taken for granted by the majority of people. For example, one of the most widespread myths is that partners should always endorse each other. Another typical myth is the dream about a perfect partner. One more myth prescribes that partners satisfy each other’s needs and match all interests in all spheres of life (Weinhold 422). These and many other myths are supported by mass culture: popular songs, movies, books, and other media promote this kind of relationship. The same mistake was constantly made during previous centuries and perhaps only religious and philosophical movements, such as Christianity, or Buddhism, had taught people true love.\n\nIt can be seen that codependency is a phenomenon that is often confused with love, due to the prevalence of numerous uncritically-perceived myths supported by modern and ancient cultures. 98% of Americans presumably are in codependent relationships. This is the unhealthy psychological state of excessive, emotional reliance on a partner, which is characterized by an obsession to control and take care of one’s partner, and by a constant search for that partner’s approval. This state is accompanied by various painful experiences, such as excessive jealousy, a feeling of abandonment, repressed anger, insults, and a constant craving for being needed and recognized. Codependency can be successfully cured without breaking relationships, but it is important for patients to realize their problem and to want to get out of it.###"}
{"prompt": "How has democracy become the cornerstone of modern civilization?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Turn on your TV and switch to a news channel. Take a pencil and a sheet of paper and prepare to take notes. Your aim is to count the use of one of the most popular words in the modern world. This word is democracy. I bet you will hear it at least 5-6 times within an hour. The word democratic has almost become a synonym to such adjectives as ‘good,’ ‘fair,’ and ‘equal’ (George 324). Politicians use it to evaluate the domestic and foreign policies of their neighbors, opponents, and allies. Simultaneously, it is obvious that in many cases, this word is misunderstood, as well as used for manipulation.\n\nWhat is democracy? Why has it become the cornerstone of modern civilization? Democracy can be understood as a process of people governing their state and managing community affairs based on consensus (Howards 27). Though democracy is often defined as a form of government, to my mind, it is more reasonable to contemplate it as a process, a constant opportunity by which citizens may bring changes into their social and political life.\n\nThe origins of democracy lie in Ancient Greece. This term was constructed from two Greek words: ‘demos,’ which means ‘people,’ and ‘cratos,’ which means ‘power.’ A long time ago, Greek men used to gather in the town square to make decisions about urgent political issues. Greek democracy was direct—not only in the sense that citizens could vote for decisions personally, but also in the sense that they could control the political process and the authorities. It must be pointed out that back then, not everyone could take part in voting—this privilege was only available to male citizens. Slaves—and ancient Greece was a slavery state—and women could not affect social and political life (George 76).\n\nAlong with the population’s growth and the complication of political processes, it had become almost impossible to conduct direct democracy. This led to a representative democracy—the model which is used all over the world today. It may be constitutional, parliamentary, or presidential—the main feature is that people affect political life through the representatives they have chosen through elections (Howards 35).\n\nModern democracy implies many privileges that ancient Greeks did not know of. For example, people now can vote regardless of their gender, skin color, social status, or financial position. Democracy is considered to be the optimal way to run the state, however many critics talk about democratic tyranny and even the injustice of this form of government (Howards 56). Imagine that in a presidential election, 49% of the electorate vote for one candidate, and 51% vote for another. The second candidate wins the election, but what about those people whose interests are subjected to the will of the majority?\n\nDemocracy is a complicated and versatile phenomenon that can be studied from different approaches. However, as Sir Winston Churchill had said once: “Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those others that have been tried.”###"}
