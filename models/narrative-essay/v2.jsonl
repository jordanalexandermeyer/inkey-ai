She dresses like she’s some exotic gypsy or something. Looks like a real high-maintenance kind of girl. Not my type; I’m not going to bother trying to get to know her.” So I didn’t. Too late, I realized what a mistake I’d made.\n\nMaria Mariella (she went by both names) was a foreign exchange student from Italy who was staying with a friend of mine, Joanne. Joanne and I weren’t that close, but we hung out in the same general crowd, so when the extended clique got together, Maria Mariella was often part of the group. We were friendly to each other, but we never tried to become friends until Shanda’s party.\n\nI wasn’t planning on going to Shanda’s party because I had a big track meet the next day, but my friend Elaine convinced me to go for a little while. When I was saying goodbye, Joanne rushed up to me.\n\n“Hey, Jenine, can you do me a really big favor? Maria Mariella needs to go home, but I want to stay. Would you mind dropping her off at my house?” I didn’t really want to, but it was on the way, and I would have looked like a real jerk if I said no, so I said, “Sure, no problem.” Maria Mariella was right behind Joanne. I looked at her and said, “Let’s go.”\n\nWe hopped into my car. As I was pulling out of the driveway, I popped in a 10,000 Maniacs cassette and turned the radio up loud.\n\n“I love this song!” Maria Mariella shouted over the music.\n\n“Really?” Not even my American friends appreciated this band. “You like the 10,000 Maniacs?”\n\n“I love them,” she said with her heavy Italian accent.\n\nAfter that, it seemed like Maria Mariella and I couldn’t stop talking to one another and finding things in common. I loved that she was straightforward and honest, like me. She shared my taste in music and film. We both had crushes on the same movie stars. It felt like a friendship that was meant to be.\n\nThen, just two weeks later, Maria Mariella threw a party at Joanne’s house. It was a going away party. Her mother had developed a serious illness, and Maria Mariella was going home to be with her. At that party, a group of us were playing Truth or Dare, one of our favorite games. It was Maria Mariella’s turn.\n\n“Truth!” she said. “Name something you regret,” our friend Denise demanded.\n\nMaria Mariella pointed a long finger at me. “I wish I’d taken the time to get to know you sooner. I didn’t think you were worth my time.”\n\nA sad smile came across my face. “I thought the same thing, Maria Mariella,” I said. “That is something I’m always going to regret.”###"}

When it happened I couldn’t believe it myself, but it’s true. This really happened.\n\nMy best friend and I were working one summer as line chefs in the Marriott at the sprawling TanTara Resort on the Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri. One Tuesday morning, as I walked through the kitchen to get to the time clock, half a dozen people said to me, “Uh-oh, man, the executive chef wants to see you.” The executive chef? But I hadn’t done anything wrong. What could he want? Why was I in trouble?\n\nI clocked in and knocked on the executive chef’s door. “Listen,” he said angrily when I sat down, “I don’t know what you guys did or how you did it, but you and your buddy Jim have off on Friday.” Friday was our busiest night; no one gets off on Friday without a very good reason. “Just one thing,” he said sternly as I got up to go, “Don’t you guys tell anyone why you’re not coming in. Understand?”\n\n“Understand,” I replied, but I had no idea what he was talking about. I had to find Jim as soon as possible and figure out what was going on. But every time I asked Jim about it, he simply said, “I’ll tell you later. Just don’t worry about it.” No matter how much I begged, he wouldn’t tell me what was going on and why we had the day off. By Thursday night, he still hadn’t told me what was happening Friday. As we were watching TV in our apartment, he said, “Let’s hit the sack early tonight. We’re going to need lots of rest for tomorrow.” Jim never went to bed early. What on earth was going on?\n\nIn the morning, Jim woke me up (another anomaly) and told me to get a quick shower, put on my bathing suit, and pack a change of clothes. A few minutes later, a dark SUV with tinted windows pulled up in front of our building. “There’s our ride,” Jim said with a secretive smile. We walked out to the car, but I wasn’t getting in without an explanation. So Jim shoved me in. Inside, I looked up, and there in the passenger seat was Hugh Jackman.\n\nNow Jim had no choice but to explain. It turns out that a friend of a friend of Jim’s knew Hugh Jackman and knew that Hugh wanted to get away for a totally private vacation between films. This friend said that he knew two guys at a large secluded lake in Missouri who would “take care of him.” So ____ called the executive chef and asked for me and Jim to have the day off.\n\nWe spent the day out on the lake with Hugh, water-skiing, fishing, eating, drinking, and telling stories. We did our best to treat him like just another guy spending the day with a couple of new friends. We didn’t ask him anything about Hollywood or his latest high-profile romance; we just let him relax and be himself for a day without cameras or fans.\n\nAt the end of the day, as we pulled back into the dock, he said, “Listen, guys, I had a really good time today. It was just what I needed. I appreciate it, man.” He shook our hands. “One favor, though?” he asked. “Don’t tell anybody about this. If people find out I’m here, I won’t get any peace and quiet. I need some time alone.”\n\n“No problem,” we said, and headed home. The next day, everyone kept asking what was so special that we had to have Friday off. The night was a disaster for the kitchen, and they were all upset that we hadn’t been there. All we could say was, “Nothing, man, nothing. We were just hanging out.” We had a great time, too, and we kept our promise.###"}

Mr. Robinson was a notorious crank, the house was always dark and creepy, and his dog was a terror—a mean, fang-toothed creature that looked like she would love to tear you apart.\n\nThe dog’s name was Angel, but she scared the devil out of us. She was half pit bull, half Doberman pinscher. Mr. Robinson kept her out on the front lawn, chained to a thin pole stuck in the ground near his front door. It was a long chain, and when I walked past the house to the bus stop, Angel always bounded toward me, barking furiously. One of these times that chain will break, I thought, and I’ll be Angel’s dinner. When I got to the Robinson house, I always walked past it as quickly as I could. Sometimes I could see Mr. Robinson watching from the window, laughing.\n\nThen it happened. We had gotten our report cards in school that day, and I was so proud of my marks and my teachers’ comments that I just had to look at them again on my way home from the bus stop. I was so wrapped up in that report card that I didn’t realize how close I was to Mr. Robinson’s house, and Angel startled me when she started barking. I dropped my report card, and just then, a big gust of wind took the paper up into the air. It landed right smack in the middle of Mr. Robinson’s lawn, about two feet away from Angel.\n\nAngel, growling ferociously, was straining her chain, trying to get closer to me. I could see her long canines. I could even smell her from where I was standing. I think I was shaking. But I needed to get that report card back. My mom had to sign it. Besides, she had to see those fantastic grades.\n\nI thought about yelling for Mr. Robinson, but I was just as afraid of him as of the dog. So I decided to see if maybe, just maybe, Angel would let me get close enough to get that piece of paper.\n\nI remembered my uncle telling me that dogs can sense your fear, and that most dogs will be friendly if you approach them in the right manner. So I did my best not to look scared. I straightened up, softened my face, and walked slowly toward Angel. She kept barking and growling. Saliva was dripping from her chin. I closed my eyes and gulped. I was about six feet away from Angel, and I put my fist out in front of me for her to smell, saying, “Here, girl. Nice girl. Good girl,” as calmly as I could. But she was barking so loudly and angrily that I’m sure she didn’t hear a word.\n\nInside, I had never been more frightened. This dog is going to tear me to pieces, I thought. But I kept going, slowly. I had never earned such good marks before. I wasn’t going to let a crazy old dog keep me from showing that report card to my parents.\n\nI was about three steps away from Angel when the wind blew again, this time sending my report card just out of Angel’s reach. I didn’t have to confront that dog after all. It was a good thing, too—Mr. Robinson later told my folks that Angel surely would have bitten me badly. I realized that what I’d planned to do was dangerous and that I was simply being stubborn. But part of me was proud, because I was brave enough to try to get close to Angel.###"}

My dad had just accepted a promotion that required a transfer, and we moved from Chicago to Oakland, California, just a few days before I was to begin the sixth grade. I didn’t even have a chance to get to know any of the kids in the neighborhood.\n\nAfter the first day of school, I could tell that Charlie Jenkins was the one who would make me or break me. He was a bully for sure, but he was so good-looking and charming that everyone seemed to like him. He was clearly the center of power in that classroom, and I knew I would have to win his approval. I just wasn’t sure what I’d have to do to get it.\n\nMy answer came at the end of the third week of school, when Ms. Harcourt gave us our second writing assignment. We’d been reading and discussing fables, and now it was our turn to write our own. That afternoon, Charlie cornered me on the playground.\n\nHe teased me about being a new kid, yet he seemed interested in the fact that I was a good writer. Our teacher, Ms. Harcourt had read aloud one of my poems in class just yesterday, and obviously he was paying attention. I admitted that I had a flair for writing, and at first I was flattered that he noticed. But, he had an ulterior motive.\n\n“Hey, new kid, hold on a second,” he said, standing between the gate and me. “You seem to be pretty good with writing.”\n\n“Yeah, you do alright, alright,” he replied. “I’ll tell you what,” he said, moving closer, until his face was just a few inches from mine. “Why don’t you just write an extra fable, one for you, one for me? Let me see what you can do.”\n\nSo that was it. I was going to do Charlie’s English homework for him. That was the price I was going to pay to be accepted.\n\nCharlie didn’t wait for an answer. “Bring two fables to school on Monday,” he said. That would give him time to copy it over into his own handwriting to submit to Ms. Harcourt on Tuesday.\n\nOver the weekend, I wrote two fables, both of them quite good, I thought, but one was definitely better than the other. On Monday morning, I met Charlie in the schoolyard as planned.\n\n“Here’s your fable,” I said to Charlie, handing him a piece of paper. I gave Charlie the fable that I thought was inferior, keeping the better fable for myself, and turned to walk away.\n\nHe questioned me about the quality of the paper, read it quickly, and decided that it passed muster. Without saying thank you or goodbye, he swaggered off into the building.\n\nA few days later, Ms. Harcourt returned our fables. I looked at my paper, expecting to see an A or A+, but my grade was an A-. Then I looked over at Charlie. He was holding his paper up high so I could see his grade: A+. I knew the fable I’d kept for myself was better. Perhaps Charlie’s charm was factored into his grade.\n\nFortunately, I only had to do one more assignment for Charlie before he and his family abruptly moved to another town. Now Charlie was going to be the new kid in the classroom. I often wondered what he had to do there to be accepted.###"}

I was pretty coordinated myself, but because I was so insecure, I never seemed to be any good at sports. I was so afraid of missing the ball that I would be sure to swing and miss, even if it was right over the plate. But Katie was my best friend, and if she joined a team, I did, too. Or at least I tried. Katie was a starter for the junior varsity field hockey team; I sat on the bench all season. Katie played regularly in JV basketball; I was cut during tryouts. I figured I was headed for a similar fate with lacrosse. But Katie was my best friend, so I signed up anyway.\n\nKatie was a natural, and she picked up the new sport quickly. I, on the other hand, couldn’t seem to hold the lacrosse stick comfortably. I caught one out of ten throws, if I was lucky, and my tosses were always way off their mark. I was clumsy and feeling clumsier, and I thought maybe it was time to give it up. But that would create an even wider gulf between Katie and me. Already she was spending more and more time with the girls who, like her, excelled at sports. I was beginning to be left behind.\n\nDetermined to stick it out and save our friendship, I begged my mom to take me to a sporting goods store and buy me an early birthday present: my own lacrosse stick and ball so I could practice at home. Katie was impressed with my stick, but I could tell that she thought it was a waste of money. She figured I would never get to use that stick in a game.\n\nI was hurt by her reaction, and again I felt the distance between us. If I was going to keep Katie as a friend, I thought, I simply had to get the hang of this sport. It was my last chance. Somehow, someway, I had to learn how to throw and catch the ball in that net and be respectable on the playing field.\n\nSo I practiced, and I practiced, and I practiced some more. I often felt like there was no hope, and I broke two windows in the garage, but I kept at it.\n\nThen, one day, just after the first official game of the season (during which I sat on the bench), something happened. I paired off with Suzie, who had become my partner since Katie had quickly proven to be too good to play with me. That day, when Suzi sent me her first throw, I caught it. When I threw the ball back to her, I hit her stick dead on. I caught her next throw, and the next. Something was happening. I was getting it. The stick was actually feeling good in my hands. The movements were becoming natural. I was catching and throwing the ball accurately.\n\nI still don’t know what exactly happened that day, but I will always be grateful for it. By the end of the season, I was starting for the JV team. I scored 12 goals that year, and the next year I was playing varsity. My success on the field gave me confidence that I desperately needed. Katie and I continued to drift apart, but Suzie turned out to be a great friend. She quit after the first year, but she came to every game to cheer me on.###"}

There were a few things I knew: He’d come over from Hungary in 1956, after the Revolution. He’d fought with the rebels in Budapest. He was a toolmaker in Hungary, and he was a toolmaker here. He left behind his parents and 11 brothers and sisters, who still lived in the countryside. They exchanged letters once or twice a year. That was about all I knew.\n\nThe summer that I was fourteen, my dad received one of those letters. In it was the news that one of his brothers had died. Maybe it was the realization that he was so out of touch with his family. Maybe it was his own mortality he was facing. In any case, a few days after the letter came, he told me about his role in the Hungarian Revolution and his escape from Hungary.\n\nThe Hungarian Revolution began with a massive student protest on October 23, 1956, and ended just a few weeks later in November after the city was invaded by Soviet tanks and the rebellion crushed. My dad, just 22 years old, had decided to join the students who were protesting the Communist regime, and soon he was not just a protester but a soldier, and not just a soldier but an officer in the rebel army. “Wait a minute,” he said, and he returned with a tattered copy of LIFE magazine’s special issue devoted to the Hungarian Revolution. He flipped through the pages, showing me image after image of buildings demolished by bombs, rebels fighting on foot against tanks, bodies lying in the street. Then he found the picture he was looking for. “There,” he said, pointing to a window in an abandoned, bullet-ridden building. “I was hiding in there, throwing Malotov cocktails at the Russian tanks.”\n\nIt’s a long and fascinating story, and I wanted to know all the details. How did he get involved? How did he escape? How close was he to being captured or killed? I had so many questions. But the question I wanted answered most was this: Why did he fight? At that age, I was just starting to find my footing in the swampy ground of ethics and moral stances. I was having a tough time figuring out what I believed in, and I wanted desperately to understand how someone could believe in something so strongly that he would be willing to die for it.\n\nWhy did he do it? There were a lot of reasons, he said. For one thing, the Communist regime was ruining the economy. As a toolmaker with several years of experience, he had a better salary than most, but still, he said, “I couldn’t afford both clothes and food.” If he respected the government, he would have been able to live with that. “But what I couldn’t live with,” he said, “was not being able to say what I wanted. The Communists, they had all kinds of restrictions on everything. You couldn’t go to the next town without the proper permissions and papers. And you couldn’t say anything, not anything, against the government, or else they’d put you in jail, or worse. They’d come and get you late at night and no one in your family would ever see you again.” That’s what happened to his best friend, Attila. He disappeared the night of September 22, and no one ever heard from him again.\n\nMy dad often complains about America. The politicians are crooks, criminals have too many rights, schools and parents aren’t strict enough with children, and the taxes are “an abomination.” But I don’t need to remind him that at least in this country, he can complain as loudly as he pleases.###"}

Edie and her older sister used to babysit my sister and me. It wouldn’t be so unlikely for her to pick up a family secret or two.\n\nKeith’s mom had told him what Edie told her because she believed it was proof that I wasn’t good enough to be his girlfriend.

I knew right away what I was going to make: my Aunt Rosie’s famous chocolate cake.\n\nMy aunt Rosie made the best chocolate cake in the world. It was a recipe she had gotten from her grandmother, who swore her grandmother had personally made that chocolate cake for the Prince of Wales. When I started the cooking class, I had asked Aunt Rosie what made her chocolate cake so special. She told me the secret ingredient was coffee.\n\nI had never tried to bake a cake from scratch before, and since the chocolate cake was Aunt Rosie’s specialty, I thought for sure she would help me make it.\n\n“But that would be cheating,” she said as a she handed me the recipe. “You go home and you make it yourself. Make sure you save a piece for me!” she hollered as I headed out the door.\n\nAt home, I got out my ingredients: eggs, butter, milk, sugar, fine powdered chocolate, cinnamon, baking powder, and coffee. The recipe looked easy enough, and I followed each step carefully. When I had mixed everything together, I carefully poured the batter into the pan. I put the cake into the oven, which I had preheated as directed, and set a timer for 50 minutes. When the buzzer went off, I stuck a toothpick into the middle of the cake to make sure it was done. It was perfect.\n\nWhen the cake cooled, I opened up a can of Betty Crocker’s chocolate frosting, spread a thick layer on top of the cake, and covered it with plastic wrap. It was a masterpiece, and I couldn’t wait for my classmates to taste it.\n\nThe next morning, I carried my cake carefully to school. I passed out pieces to my classmates, beaming with pride. But when I saw the look on their faces, I knew something was terribly wrong. I took a bite and nearly burst into tears. No wonder they looked disgusted! Aunt Rosie’s cake was never crunchy, and the crunchy things were bitter. The cake tasted awful. My heart sank as I watched Mrs. Wilson take a bite. She crunched, paused, crunched again, paused again, and looked at me thoughtfully.\n\n“Sarah,” she said gently, “does the recipe for this cake call for coffee?”\n\n“Yes,” I replied.\n\n“Hmmm. I thought so.”\n\nWhen I questioned her about my mistake, she said, “You used coffee grounds. You were supposed to use liquid coffee,” she said, and she laughed gently.\n\nI was mortified.

But instead of hearing the crunch of metal crashing into metal, I heard the screeching of brakes as the truck swerved around me, just in time to avoid a head-on collision. The truck skidded to a stop on the shoulder about a hundred feet away from me. Then the driver jumped out and ran over to see if I was okay.\n\nThat night at home, I eased my aching body into bed. But I was climbing into my own bed, in my own room, not in the hospital. Somehow, the only injuries I sustained were a few cuts on my face and hands, a bruised right shoulder, and two bruised calf muscles. My new car was totaled, but I didn’t care. All that mattered was that I was alive.###"}
{"prompt": "Describe an experience you had that would be considered a near miss or a brush with disaster.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I must have had a guardian angel that day.\n\nI was six and had just learned how to ride a bicycle. My bike was a beauty: pink all over, with a stylish banana seat, iridescent fringes hanging off the handle bars, and a white woven basket with big, pink flowers on the front.\n\nIt was a Monday afternoon and I was alone, riding my bike in circles in the driveway. I was exalting in my freedom: no more training wheels, no more big brother or father pushing me from behind and holding me steady. Now I could start, stop, and ride all by myself, and I went around and around our circular driveway in complete bliss.\n\nThe sun shone on my face and made the black pavement hot, even though it was already late September. Emboldened by the warmth of the sun and the excitement of my success—eight laps around and I hadn’t fallen yet—I decided it was time to leave the safety of the circle and ride down the steep hill that led to the road on which we lived: Route 309, a four-lane, heavily-traveled highway. I warmed up with another two or three turns around the circle and then eased to my right and down the slope.\n\nFrom the start of the circle to the edge of the highway, the driveway ran about 200 feet at an even 45 degrees. I began to pick up a lot of speed at 50 feet, more at 75, and by 100 feet I was flying. The road was getting closer; I could see the faces of the people driving by at 50, 60, 70 miles an hour. It was time to slow down, but I couldn’t. I kept going faster, and faster, and I couldn’t stop. In my panic, I forgot how to use the brakes.\n\nIn an instant I was out on the highway, a little pink streak that zoomed across all four lanes and somehow, someway, ended up on the other side, up on the Zeigler’s lawn, in one piece. In the seconds that it took me to cross the road, there had not been a single car. An instant later, they were back, and I had to wait several minutes before I slowly, shakily, walked my bike back across the street and up the driveway.\n\nI never told anyone about what happened, and it was a long, long time before I ventured down that slope again. When I did, I used my brakes the whole way down. This time, I wasn’t going to forget.###"}
{"prompt": "We all need help from others from time to time. Tell about a time you helped someone in need.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " It was the hottest day of the summer, a record-breaking 102 degrees, hot and humid, sweltering even in the shade. I was driving back from visiting my older brother and his new baby. In the blistering heat, I could see the blacktop bubbling. I’d never been so grateful for air conditioning before.\n\nI cruised happily along County Route 2, which wound through the northern tip of the Sonoran Desert. Then I saw that a car had broken down up ahead. It was the first car I’d seen in about half an hour. In the distance, a few hundred feet ahead of the car, I saw a stooped figure walking with a gas can in his hands. There was nothing around for miles. There was no way this person was going to make it to the nearest town, which was a good twenty miles away, in this desert heat.\n\nI’d always been told to stay away from strangers, but I thought if there ever was a time to do a good deed, this was it. Besides, as I neared the figure, I could tell that it was an elderly man, and I thought there was little chance he’d do me any harm. So I slowed down and pulled over. “Need a lift?” I asked.\n\nNow that I could see him clearly, it was obvious the old man was already in trouble. He’d only walked a hundred yards or so, and he looked as if he was going to pass out any moment. “I’d be most grateful, young lady, if you could help me get to a gas station,” he said slowly. “I seem to be out of petroleum.”\n\n“No problem,” I replied. “I’m headed that way.”\n\nHe climbed slowly into the car and I pulled back out onto the road. “Not a good day for car trouble, huh?” I asked.\n\n“Indeed,” he replied. He was silent for a few minutes while his body temperature normalized. I offered him a soda from the cooler I’d packed for my four-hour ride. He accepted it gratefully. We made a little small talk then, but just a little. He seemed to prefer the silence.\n\nAs we neared the gas station, I asked him if he would like a ride back to his car. “I don’t have to be home until late this afternoon,” I told him. “It’s no trouble.”\n\n“I know it is quite out of your way,” he replied. “I would be most grateful.” He paused. “And just where is home, young lady?”\n\n“Elmwood,” I replied. I introduced myself as Emily Hampton and found out that he was Edward Gilliam. “By the way, my name is Emily. Emily Hampton.”\n\n“You’re a very kind lady, Ms. Hampton. My name is Edward Gilliam.” Edward filled up his gas can and I drove him back to his car. We filled up his tank, and I followed him back into town just to make sure he was ok. At the gas station, I beeped and waved and continued north towards home. Edward waved and nodded his thanks.\n\nThe next morning, the doorbell rang. My mom answered. “Emily!” she hollered. “Get down here!” I came down the stairs and saw a giant bouquet of flowers. They were stunning. A small note was attached:\n\n“Dearest Emily, thank you for your incredible kindness yesterday. You just might have saved my life, and I am eternally grateful. You reminded an old man of how much beauty there is in this world. Yours, Edward Gilliam.”###"}
{"prompt": "What are the different reactions you can have when meeting a famous person?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Meeting a famous person is almost always a shock and/or surprise. You see them on screen or on the internet and then there they are, right in front of you. It is a surreal experience. I got the chance to meet the members of the Counting Crows band, the great spiritual leader Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, the inimitable percussionist Zakir Hussain, and more famous people. Each of these experiences were different and produced a myriad feelings in me.\n\nWhen I was about fifteen years old, I got a VIP pass to a huge Counting Crows concert. The bassist was a family friend through a meditation group. The band was once on Rolling Stones magazine, and one of the most popular rock bands in the world. To get a VIP pass seemed to be something out of a dream. The ticket qualified me to meet all the members of the band backstage, to see the starting band, and to watch the whole process of setting up for the concert. The bassist Matt Malley is a kind man who is down to earth—probably due to his practice of meditation. I did not have so much anxiety while meeting him and getting to know him better, but the other band members were more reserved. They also seemed full of themselves. They smiled and made friendly gestures, but I felt like I was seen as lesser than them in their eyes. But anyways, watching the stage being set up and all the microphones being checked, I understood how much goes into putting on a stadium concert. It takes hours of preparation and dedication to produce quality sound. And right before the show started, I met the band called Live, who was starting for the Counting Crows. For some reason, I was shy when talking to them and only exchanged a few words with them. Once again, I felt the distance between me, a regular citizen, and these rock star.\n\nIn terms of a totally different experience, I met the spiritual leader and teacher Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi—Shri Mataji for short. The most memorable moment I had with her was having it being announced that she was coming to a meditation hall. I felt an immense amount of energy even before she came. This energy was like a cool breeze in my hands and above my head. As the time became closer and closer to her arrival, the breeze only increased. I realized it was her energy that I was feeling flowing through my body. It made me realize that one person could be so powerful in terms of how much he or she can give just by being present. It made me want to meditate much more seriously, to be able to give others the same energy on such a grand scale. The cool breeze made me feel peaceful inside and all my thoughts calmed down. I became completely satisfied and serene. As she finally came to the hall, my hands were overflowing with the energy she emitted. It reminded me of Star Wars, where the force is said to be everywhere and that masters of the force can control it. I may not have gotten spiritual enlightenment, but by just meeting Shri Mataji, I felt that I got a piece of it.\n\nTurning from spirituality, now I will visit a brief memory of meeting an eminent musician that went differently than I thought it would. I have always enjoyed Zakir Hussain’s tabla playing (an Indian classical percussion instrument), but when I met him after a concert, for some reason, I tried to act uninterested. My tabla teacher requested for me to meet him in a big crowd of admirers. I respected my teacher so much and believed him to be the best tabla player that I feigned indifference in meeting the most popular tabla player in the world. He asked me, “How are you?” after we were introduced. And for some reason, I did not answer and looked into his eyes and we shared a moment of silence before the crowd once again took over the conversation. I was impressed that the first thing he would say to me was natural and a question about my well-being. It was a simple question, but it affected me. It taught me to think of others, even if I got famous.\n\nThree experiences with famous people, and various results. From Matt Malley, I learned to be humble in fame; from Shri Mataji, I learned to what extent a human being can influence people spiritually; from Zakir Hussain, I realized we should have our attention on others even when we are known worldwide. I also learned that famous people are like you and me, but often with the world on their shoulders.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of your earliest memories?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In elementary school, I had many experiences that garnered memories. I was often bullied on the playground during recess because of my skinniness and height. The larger boys saw me as a target for their ego to inflate. They might have had problems at home, or were bullied themselves, and were projecting their frustrations on me.\n\nAnyways, after being locked in a locker, put headfirst into a toilet, punched and pushed around, called names, played jokes on, and other abuse, I finally had enough. I cracked. I could not psychologically take anymore hurt and punctures to my self-esteem.\n\nA day or two after my birthday, I was on the school basketball court, shooting hoops. My mother had given me a basketball as a gift, and I was reveling in the fun of this new sport. But as expected (though I did not think about it at the time), another child started to bother me. He came up to me, and without a word, took the basketball out of my hands as I was dribbling. I was so shocked and emotionally tied to that gift that without a moment’s notice, I punched the kid in the face. I knocked him down and he immediately ran away crying. I never asked if he was playfully taking the ball from me, but I had had enough bullying in my day to react strongly to such an action.\n\nApparently, the boy went to the principal and reported my violence. I was called to the principal’s office during my next class, and walked in with my own form of ethics. The boy had been a bully, and he deserved a repercussion. However, the principal and I did not see eye to eye, naturally. He called my mother about the incident, and she was surprised that I would do such a thing. I had always been the quiet kid, playing with toys by himself, or tagging along with other children as more of a witness than a major participant. No one’s mother expects their child to punch someone, but it happens for certain reasons. In my case, I had been dominated by my classmates for years, and that pent-up anger and shame resulted in a violent action.\n\nFrom then on, I figured out that I did not need to be bullied. I could take action. I found that my anger and resentment gave me a wild strength, which was unmatched by the usual fighting powers of a calm kid. In a way, I went to the dark side (in reference to Star Wars). I found a way to combat my enemies, but not in the healthiest of avenues.\n\nIn middle school, I dug my nails into a boy’s arm and restrained him after he made several verbal attacks towards me. He was much bigger and taller than me, but my anger guided me towards illogic and throwing estimating my chances to the wind.\n\nIn high school, a junior beat up my twin brother. My brother and I were both freshmen at the time. When I saw him next, I choked him and even dragged him up to a light post, where I banged his head on a metal pole. His girlfriend was watching and was terrified. I do not know exactly what I had come over me, but from that time in elementary school where I first used my fists to resolve an issue, I did not look back. I had found a solution that made me feel strong, confident, and able to take on the world. However, there was one problem: it put holes in my bedroom door, it led to unnecessary attacks on my family, and I found that the sensation of not being able to control my anger troubling.\n\nThank heavens I started to meditate. By the time I was 19 years old, bullies were not a problem anymore, and I had no use for my boiling anger. When I started to meditate every day, I found that the person beyond the anger was much more agreeable to be around. I wanted to be more like that person every day. So, I continued to meditate daily, and eventually I became the person that I wanted to be. I learned that anger was a temporary solution, but I did not need to drag it on throughout the years. Now, I am much more satisfied to be peaceful inside.###"}
{"prompt": "What was your experience like when you first visited India?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As a 20-year-old college student with cash to spare, going to India was a dream. I had been listening to tons of Indian classical music, meditating, and loved Indian food. I daydreamed of the day I could step foot in India and see if for myself. They say there are two reactions when coming to India: either you hate it, or think it is the best place the world has to offer. After being there five times, it is still my favorite place to visit. But for now, I will talk about the first time I visited this land.\n\nMy father passed away when I was 18 years old, and I got some inheritance money (one year’s salary of my father’s work as a radiology manager in a hospital). With this money, I had enough money to travel to India and study music there at a music academy for Indian classical arts. I felt it was a way for me to go through the grieving process, and also a way to reach my dreams.\n\nI was to stay in India for 10 months. Six months at the music academy, and four months traveling. The plane ride there was the longest I had ever been on. I remember it being about 24 hours long. I felt as if I entered a new dimension of claustrophobia and anticipation. But mostly, I was too hyped to go to India to care about the negatives.\n\nI did not travel alone. I went with my brother and friend, but our connecting flights were different. This spelled trouble. My connecting flight from Moscow to India was delayed because of a blizzard. Figures, right? My brother and our friend got to India almost a day earlier than me. We did not have cell phones back then, so I had no way of reaching them. I would just have to wait until I got to academy to talk to them.\n\nSo, when I arrived in Mumbai, I had a mix of feelings swirling through my body. I was excited to see the sun rise on the great land of India, but I also knew I was stranded in a country I did not know much about. I decided to book a hotel for the night, as it was late in the evening when I arrived. I figured I would pay a driver to take me to the music academy, which was about three hours away from Mumbai.\n\nI arrived at the hotel in a taxi, and people were asking for tips for everything: opening the door, bringing water to me, carrying my luggage, and I happily gave it out due to my exhilaration (even though Indian people do not usually give tips for these things). But when I saw my room, it was shabby, and the bathroom had centipedes and other insects lining the walls. I was shocked and little terrified. I was thinking about how I was going to sleep there without getting bombarded by these creatures. But anyways, my enthusiasm for seeing an Indian sunrise conquered this fear.\n\nI woke up early the next morning, and talked to the hotel staff about arranging a car to the music academy. The driver said that he knew where it was without hesitation. The academy was in a town called Vaitarna, and I took the driver’s word that he knew where he was going. Little did I know that in India, people almost never say “no” and simply say something even if they are not knowledgeable about a certain subject. So, instead of the driver taking me to the music academy, he took me hours in the wrong direction to an ashram of a spiritual teacher, or guru.\n\nBut positivity can change one’s outlook, as I was not so concerned about getting lost. I was a little upset that I was taken to a strange guru, but at the same time happy to be in India. The people at the ashram seemed like decent people, and after a phone call from their office to the music academy, my brother and my friend were informed about where I was. They said they would come to pick me up with one of the academy’s drivers. In the meantime, I was playing chess with one of the locals there, drinking masala chai tea, and enjoying realizing the reality of what I envisioned. From that day, I learned more than ever that attitude can make a sour experience a joyful one.###"}
{"prompt": "What was the most memorable experience you have ever had?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When I was about 13 years old, I visited an airport in Vancouver, Canada, to see a great holy personality: Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. She was the founder of Sahaja Yoga Meditation—a worldwide movement of spiritual practices that continues to this day. My mother was and still is a follower of hers and I was merely interested and tagging along. It turned out to be one of my most memorable experiences.\n\nGetting to the airport, I was nervous for some reason. I never saw Shri Mataji in person, and she was and still is highly revered in India and abroad. So, it was a bit like seeing a celebrity for the first time. There was a large crowd at the entry gate where she was supposed to come out. Word usually spread about where she was travelling and her followers would come to each airport to go to greet her into a new country or city. Commonly, people would enjoy giving her flowers as she entered the airport, and she would talk to her disciples in the process.\n\nIn light of this, I was carrying a flower as well. As soon as it was announced that she was coming through the entry gate, my nervousness shot up. People began to get closer to the gate in an almost half circle. As Shri Mataji passed through the gate, people walked towards her in an unrushed way, and gave her flowers, one by one. Shri Mataji was giving short comments to each person like, “Thank you,” “Oh, such a nice fragrance,” and such. Sometimes, she would stall at one person and ask about his or her family or a meditation program he or she was conducting.\n\nWhen it came to my turn to give a flower, I did not know what to do. My mother looked at me with kind eyes and prompted me to offer her a flower at her feet, as was the custom in Indian society to a guru or a person of significant stature. I do not remember what Shri Mataji told me and how she looked at me, but what has stayed strong in my memory is how I was smiling. I was smiling in such a way that I have never done. I felt so much joy and satisfaction that it is practically indescribable.\n\nI was smiling so much that I even tried to stop smiling. For some reason, I could not stop my face from making an expression of happiness. It was like I had lost control over my facial movements, or that I could not edge my way out of how I was feeling. There seemed to be no stopping my joy.\n\nThe rest is a blur, but I do remember going to the house where Shri Mataji was staying. Even after the ecstatic experience at the airport, I was still too shy to be in her presence. So, I mostly watched her interactions with people from afar and did not try to get in a conversation with her. My mother, on the other hand, was comfortable speaking to her, and was even talking to her about the future health of my little adopted sister, who was born drug-affected. At that moment, I was watching this unfold from a glass screen door from the backyard. Reflecting upon this, I feel a bit of shame and disappointment that I did not have the courage to converse with this great person. In a way, I missed the chance of lifetime, as Shri Mataji became increasingly busy in the future—so, it became more and more difficult to find an opportunity to talk to her on a personal level.\n\nAnyways, the joy and satisfaction I felt when I offered a flower to Shri Mataji’s feet is something I will never forget and still reminisce about at the age of 33. I think it is the fact that I felt a height of emotion and spiritual bliss that I never experienced before, and that it happened seemingly in an instant. When I meditate now each day, I try to achieve that same feeling and mood. Sometimes I can get glimpses of it spontaneously—but other times, I wish I could meet Shri Mataji again, though she has now passed away. To this day, I am amazed that just the presence of a person can uplift someone to such a consciousness.###"}
{"prompt": "What was your first job?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Everyone’s first job is special. There are a couple of reasons for this: the experience is burned in one’s memory, it gives you the practice needed to fulfill other positions, and it teaches you about the value of money. Of course we do jobs around the house when we are young, like cleaning dishes, vacuuming, and doing laundry, but working for others for money gives off a different feeling.\n\nWhen I was about sixteen years old, I wanted to buy albums from my favorite bands, but I did not have any money. My parents were not the type of people to give money to me out of nowhere, or even for work done at home. I had to find work in order to purchase the music I wanted.\n\nSo, I inquired as to who could give me work around town. I lived in the town of Woodway, which was relatively small, with no street lights, and hardly any population. But my neighborhood, Twin Maples, had enough people, especially elderly people, that needed help in their yards. I went to the oldest person I knew in my neighborhood, Mrs. Hudson. She was over eighty years old, and could not tend her garden anymore. She had flowers, a grass lawn, and some tomato plants. I knocked on her door, building up enough courage to ask her for work. She answered that indeed she needed help in her garden. She did not discuss the amount of money I would get for the work.\n\nMy first job was to pull out weeds. I got down on my knees with foam protectors and began to pull out weeds one by one in her front yard and backyard. After this tedious task, I mowed her lawn—front and back. That was it for my first day, and it took me about two hours. I asked her much I would get paid, and she said, “I will give you $5 an hour. I don’t know much people are paid these days, anyways.” It was less than I thought I would get paid, but at least I had a job.\n\nAfter getting that $10, I walked the few miles to the supermarket at the top of the hill, above the Puget Sound. I went to the electronics section of the supermarket, and bought an album from the band “Tool,” which was extremely popular at that time. It was dark and richly-layered alternative rock music with sinister lyrics: the type of music teenagers enjoy.\n\nOne of my favorite hobbies was to lay on my lawn with two computer speakers between my ears and to listen to music with all of its nuances, moods, and atmospheres. This, and taking in the fresh air of the woods around me, was a sort of bliss. That is why I worked: to make these moments even more rapturous with more music.\n\nAfter many days of working for Mrs. Hudson, and buying more CDs, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to save money for something even more interesting than music: a Gameboy. Gameboys at this time were all the rage, so it was natural for me to yearn for it. I started to work for multiple clients, so to say, in order to earn enough money to purchase this prized possession.\n\nWhen I gathered enough money to buy a Gameboy (it was about $100 at that time), I went out to a shop and bought a shiny red one, and one game to play on it. However, after one day of playing on it, I realized that I had made a mistake: it was not as fun as I thought it was going to be, and I felt like I wasted my money. I sweated in the hot sun for hours doing yard work to buy something I did not want. So, the next day, I returned it for a full refund. From then on, I bought only music albums with my money.\n\nI think everyone should get on one’s knees and pull weeds. I believe everyone should at least once work for an elderly person, and help him or her take care of his or her garden. I think everyone should feel the searing sun on one’s back as they mow grass. It seems these experiences harden our spirits and resolve, and make us more in touch with the earth. Besides this, a first job like this supplies you with the value of money, as sweat turned into cash is something no can take away from you.###"}
{"prompt": "How did a six-month stay at the Vaitarna Music Academy in India teach you important life lessons?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " While studying at The Evergreen State College, a liberal arts college, I got the chance to apply for a contract class where I could get credit doing educational work of my own vision. This is one of the specialities of The Evergreen State College, and I was lucky enough to land a contract with a professor to go to India to study in a musical academy for six months. It seemed like a dream: doing what I love the most, and all for college credit.\n\nI had been to this academy before for four months a few years back. However, this time I was determined to take this learning experience more seriously. My goal was to become at least semi-professional at tabla by the end of my training.\n\nI was ecstatic when I arrived in Vaitarna—a village about a three-hours drive from Mumbai. There, the Vaitarna Music Academy is situated. I found out about this academy from my meditation group, Sahaja Yoga Meditation. Since it is in a village, the scenery is picturesque: rolling hills next to a river, with a multitude of wildlife, like snakes, buffaloes, geese, rabbits, and more. The Academy itself is not fancy, but it is cozy and has all the amenities you would need. I was not so concerned about comforts, though. I was there to learn the art of a percussion instrument named the tabla.\n\nSince I had been there before, it did not take long for me to adjust to the environment and schedule of the Academy. At around 7:30 a.m., I would practice tabla for about 30 minutes to get a warm up—most of it was repetitive practice of phrases. This was followed by a collective meditation on the main stage by all the students and teachers. The Academy was founded by the spiritual teacher Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, so meditation is in integral part of the curriculum.\n\nAfter an hour meditation, we would head off to breakfast. The breakfast lasted one hour, and after that, we went to our classes at 10 a.m. I came at a time during the year where there were hardly any tabla students, and for most of the time of my stay, I was the only tabla student in the class. This meant more intensive learning and more absorption of information.\n\nThe first lesson of the day went on for two hours. Commonly, each day, I would learn a new composition or variation of a rhythm cycle. I was expected to know the new rhythm well enough by the next day that I could play it competently without mistake. That was the challenge.\n\nAfter the two-hour class, we would have an hour lunch, and then a rest period to nap or just chill out together. At 4 p.m., another two-hour class would resume. These later classes were more relaxed, and focused on working on what we had learned in the morning and reviewing what we knew already.\n\nAfter the second class of the day, there was some time before dinner to relax. Dinner also ran for about an hour. Around 8 p.m., the evening collective meditation happened. Sometimes there were musical performances at night by students, teachers, or for the village people. After this, our time was spent being in each other’s company, playing games, chatting, talking about music, and just getting to know each other better. The camaraderie between the students was palpable.\n\nThis is an outline of what happened on the weekdays, with Saturday being a day with only one class, and Sunday being free. Now, I want to get more into the details of the six-month stay and the style of teaching that was used at the Academy.\n\nEach day was hot, and the fans above did not help much. The teaching rooms were almost empty, save a few mats and cushions, and some hanging art. It was mostly an open space with a few instruments. The classes were intensive, with continuous playing for two hours. Often my teacher would want me to follow him on the tabla, matching his beats as he flowed from one variation to the next. He would slowly increase the difficulty and speed, until I felt like my fingers were breaking. Sometimes I would tell my teacher that I could not play any longer, as my fingers could not move anymore. However, most of the time, he said to keep pushing myself, and to keep playing. This was a test of endurance, stamina, confidence, and mental capacity. In a sense, when you are trying to go beyond your supposed limit, you need to remain calm in the mind—at least that is what I learned from those types of sessions.\n\nIn other sessions, my teacher, a strict but lovable Muslim man, would recite a tabla composition and I had to recite it back to him. Tabla has its own language for the notes it makes, and we speak this language in order to convey a composition. I was never good at remembering compositions and learning them by heart, as per the tradition in India. I wrote notes and took videos of my lessons in order to remember them. Though this was not traditional, it was acceptable for a westerner.\n\nMy teacher would shout at me and correct me if anything I played was wrong, immediately. Sometimes he would get so fed up with me that he would push my hands away from the tabla and play what needed to be played, glaring into my eyes. This type of intimidation worked, as I feared making a mistake. This made my attention stronger and more dedicated to listening. His teaching demonstrated to me that there should be no compromise in quality and exactness. One should strive for perfection, or as close to it as possible.\n\nThe food we were fed there was simple: mostly rice and dal with vegetables every day. The village was excluded from modern conveniences. Each day was scheduled the same. Each day was hot, with the nights giving little rest from the heat. There was not much to do besides practice and learn music. This atmosphere taught me that to be fully concentrated on learning, one needs to create a minimalist environment so that distractions cannot bother you.\n\nAfter six months at the Academy, I could play exponentially better and felt at home in India—especially in the nature. However, it was the life lessons and building of character that I will cherish the most from this experience: how to push yourself to your limits, how to create the best learning environment, how to respect and act around a teacher, how to be disciplined, and how to succeed in the face of your shortcomings.###"}
{"prompt": "How did a natural baptism at a summer camp lead to a change in perspective for the author?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When I was 11 years old, I attended a Unitarian church camp for a summer vacation with my family. It was a pleasant area, with the Puget Sound not far away, grass fields, many old-style wooden buildings, an expansive forest, and an elongated pond between the road and the camp. Deer and other wildlife regularly visited the grounds. It was an ideal place to forget your worries and the routine of common life. As an 11-year-old boy, it was a place for me to meet my friends, and maybe fall in love with a girl. However, this summer camp was more spiritual than others—not because of a religious message, but because I had an awakening at the camp that year.\n\nI had been going to this summer retreat almost every year since I was very young. But somehow, this year was different. It seemed my mind and soul was ripe for a transformation. I recorded my first poem in my 11th year, and I seemed more introspective than usual. I was less interested in playing and joking around with my friends. I was searching for answers to deep questions about life and God.\n\nWhile walking down a path next to a grass field leading to the camp’s cafeteria, suddenly my vision changed. The grass was shining, the texture of the bark of trees was lucid, and each detail around me seemed like it was the first time I was seeing. In a sense, it was a feeling of rebirth. In church, there is talk of baptism, which is more of a ritual than anything else, in my opinion. The real baptism is an inner transformation. But back to the experience, this natural baptism came spontaneously. No effort was put into it. It was like a light was switched on in my consciousness, and I saw everything as new again. This sight was accompanied by a fresh sense of peace—a mental silence that I had not experienced before. Also, joy was coursing through my being at the exhilaration of such a happening.\n\nFrom that moment, the world around me and within me was never the same. The only problem was that I was too young to fully grasp what had happened. In fact, I thought I was some sort of prophet. Seeing a tarot card reader only made the issue worse. Through the reading, I thought I was “the victory of the people,” and someone no one else was like. However, there were many other people who had the same experience—I just did not know this at that tender age. Later in life, I learned there are many people just like me, and that I was not all that special.\n\nWhat I learned from this experience is that baptism, or spiritual rebirth, is a spontaneous happening, and not done only from the hand of a priest. Also, I learned about getting a spiritual ego, where you think you are important based on spiritual experiences. My natural baptism and my knowledge of spiritual ego has allowed me to gain much in life: more creativity, inner peace, and how to be humble in the face of achievements.###"}
{"prompt": "What was the most difficult decision you ever had to make?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Ideally, the ultimate chess game would be between the two highest rated chess programs, which can even kick the world champion to the curb (which is possible right now). However, I will be writing from personal experience rather than hypothetical situations and world champion matches.\n\nI had been a passionate and obsessed chess player in high school. More time was spent on chess than my studies. I would stay up late at night, studying chess games and playing against my twin brother, while during the day, I attended the high school chess club. At that time, chess meant almost everything to me.\n\nAfter playing on one of the best high school chess teams in Washington state, I thought I was ready for the big time: the Washington State Chess Open. In the Open, there were grandmasters and local legends that I dreamed to beat and to become. I knew I had to train harder than I ever had done to be able to compete with them. I did not have a grandmaster handy to train with, so I downloaded a chess computer program that I thought was about as strong as me or a bit stronger. It had the rating of 2000 elo points, which is about expert strength, or that of a candidate master. I believed myself to be that strong on my good days, and one of my strengths was my self confidence in light of turmoil on the board.\n\nI set up a 5-game match between this computer program and I. In my quiet room in the town of Woodway, with a chess board in the middle of the room, and a chess clock on the table to simulate the time control I would play in the Open, I kept a laptop on another table to host the chess program. Each time I started a game, I made sure I had everything set up and that I was mentally prepared for it. I was doing opening preparation before the games, and constantly studying other aspects of chess as well. I was treating this match as a sort of chess boot camp.\n\nThe time control for the games was 90 minutes for 40 moves, and 60 minutes for all moves after that for each side. Obviously, the computer program was much faster than me, as it could calculate thousands of positions within a few seconds. So, time pressure was always in the back of mind. But I thought that under these strenuous conditions against an expert-level player, this would be the best training for the upcoming Open.\n\nThe first game was a draw, though hard-fought. I was barely able to hold onto my position in the endgame, but managed to. The second game was slow torture, as the computer kept building a better position against me while I committed inaccuracy after inaccuracy. The computer ultimately won that game. With the score not in my favor, the third game was a breaking point. Either I had to win, or else my chances of tying or winning the match were slim. I played my usual London System, which is a solid opening choice that is more positional than tactical. However, the game was not positional at all. The computer opted for the rare Dutch Defense, and right away, fireworks happened on the board. I took on an aggressive attitude in the game, and I reaped the benefits: his king was soon being attacked from my active pieces, especially bishops. To open up the kingside more, I sacrificed a bishop and used multiple types of tactics that deserved brilliancy marks. The positions in the game seemed to beg for these sacrifices and crazy tricks. The game was over in a mere 27 moves. It was difficult for me to grasp that I had beaten a 2000-rated chess computer is such a fashion. I call this my ultimate game not because it was the strongest opponent I beat, but because it seemed that I tapped into a tactical intelligence that was akin to a grandmaster like the legend Mikhail Tal. I somehow made it look easy to beat this computer, even though the match was eventually tied, with the last two games being uneventful draws. That flash of brilliancy proved to myself that I could compete with the masters in the Open.\n\nIn fact, I achieved a solid score in the Open, with two wins, two draws, and one loss—with all opponents being higher rated than me. My loss was against a veteran master player who had a book out about himself and his games. It saddened me that my only game in the top section of the tournament was a loss; however, after the game, the master showed me that I could have drawn the game if I played a different move in the endgame. This illustrated to me that there is a fine line between winning and losing in such high-level games, and that I need to practice day and night to cross over that line to be able to compete squarely with such masters. Though I beat two expert-level players during the tournament, I was not yet stable at master level, and the veteran master had demonstrated my weaknesses.\n\nAfter this tournament, I decided, though, to let chess rest and to take up writing seriously. I looked into my future, and wanted to be a writer rather than a chess player. I think it was the correct decision, though I will never forget my training for and performance at the Washington State Chess Open. The concentration, effort, and dedication it took to perform well in chess has allowed me to succeed in many other areas of my life, and shaped my character to what it is today.###"}
{"prompt": "What was your experience with church camp?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When I was 15, I attended a church camp in the summer. This was not your usual church. It was named The Center for Spiritual Living, which meant that they accepted almost anything that was positive for them in terms of religious belief. However, it was with a heavy lean towards Christianity, with a dash of various religious practices.\n\nAnyways, I was a part of the teen group there for obvious reasons. Though most teens there were at least somewhat spiritual, I think what was mostly on their minds was finding their next girlfriend or boyfriend. It was no different for me. I had my first kiss at 11 years old at that church camp with a stunning girl of Russian descent, and even had a make-believe marriage with her.\n\nBut going back on track, the church camp was a 5-day affair that had a dance, talent show, a sports tournament, hikes, salmon bake, and much more. Another big thing that was happening was the election for the teen leader for the church. For some odd reason, I thought I should enter the election. Maybe it was because some of my peers prompted me to do so, or that I believed I was a leader (I had a tarot card reading at the camp years before that pointed to me being a leader, so maybe that pushed me in that direction). I entered the election with little preparation and even littler thought about what the position meant. Maybe I wanted to prove to myself that I could win—sounds like something a younger twin brother would do.\n\nSo, when the election came around, there was this one candidate that annoyed me. I thought we were friends, but he would come to me with sweets and other things to try to bribe me out of the election. He was a rich kid who could afford all this stuff, while I was a middle-class kid who barely ever thought of buying something. I did not take the bribes and was aghast that he would do something corrupt for such a insignificant election.\n\nWhen the election speeches rolled out, I spoke about Buddha being my idol and how I would lead the youth members with him in mind. In retrospect, it sounds highfalutin, but I guess it worked, because they elected me to lead the youth congregation. I was ecstatic, though I tried my best to hide it. In fact, a few days after I was elected, reality came crashing in my head, and I tried to come to grips with what had happened. I wanted to prove to myself that I could win, but now that I had won, I did not know if I could handle the responsibility. I think I liked being “in charge” but not the weight that goes with it.\n\nBut onto a more important point, can you imagine I got bribed during a church youth leader election? Not only was it for a church, but for such a minor position, that is difficult to grasp why someone would go through that trouble. This situation proved to me that within politics, even from its lowest denomination, corruption is present. In fact, a month after being the leader of the youth congregation, I quit due to being disgusted with the amount of money trying to be raised for “important” purposes, having a huge donation banner on the left side of the church hall. I became disillusioned with churches in general, and meditated instead, finding God within me.###"}
{"prompt": "How does one's gut instinct compare to rational thought in times of peril?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When I was 13 years old, I went on a 735-mile cycling trip with my brother and father. My father was a professional cyclist, and wanted to show us, his twin songs, the work of the trade and bond with us. My brother Chris and I were ecstatic for the adventure—my mother not so much. However, there is nothing that can stop three adventurous guys.\n\nThe trip was across the San Juan Islands and then Vancouver Island. We prepared for the journey by going on smaller rides and practiced cycling with panniers. Adjusting to the weight on the bike was harder than I thought. We were all avid cyclists, even though my brother and I were so young. I can say I felt like I was born on a bike, despite smashing into a mailbox the first time I rode one without training wheels.\n\nWhen we set out for the trip, I knew that I yearned to have an adventure and wanted to see the beautiful sights of mountains, bears, moose, deer, forests, and much more. But I what I did not realize was that trouble was around each corner. There were bears, inclement weather, cougars, and much more.\n\nOne night, after perhaps a week into the trip, we were on our last legs getting to a campsite, and going down a large hill. It was raining moderately and we were coasting down the hill in eager delight to take a rest from going up a mountain with all of our gear and sore legs.\n\nSuddenly, my brother’s front tire slipped in the rain, and he slid into the middle of the road. My father and I stopped, asking if he was okay. Apparently, he was not hurt too much, but his leg was caught up in the bike frame. From the top of the hill, we saw the light of a car coming. My father and I looked on in shock. Chris could not seem to get out of the entrapment of his bike, and now the car was blasting his way. This all happened within seconds.\n\nInstinctively, I rushed out in front of my brother in the middle of the road, and waved my hands frantically. The car rushed forward, but swerved to the left to go around my brother and I. My brother was saved from being crushed by the car, and for some reason, I did not think that I was risking my life. It seemed like the only thing to do. There was no way I would watch my brother die under the wheels of a truck.\n\nMy brother says I was incredibly brave, but I think we do what we know is right.  I believe that one should listen to one’s gut in times of peril, and not intellectualize dilemmas. If I had thought about what I was doing on that night, my brother might have been robbed from this world. Life and death often swing in the balance between what seems natural and rational.###"}
{"prompt": "What made you fight back after years of being bullied?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I was rather small and skinny, and because of this, I had been dumped into toilets, locked into lockers, pushed around, called names, and I was finished with it. No one was going to bully me anymore. That is how I felt in the fifth grade, when for years I had been subjected to torment by my larger peers.\n\nMadrona Elementary was a non-graded school, which meant that we never received a grade, but only a “pass” or “fail.” It is a progressive approach to education, but the playground and the halls were not as modern as one might expect. The issue of bullying still abounded. Perhaps even more so, with troubled children coming to the school to find an easier footing in the Washington state educational system. Though I had been bullied for as long I could remember, it never stopped. Pacifism had not done its purported job.\n\nOn my birthday in the fifth grade, I got a basketball from my mother. Basketball was my favorite sport, though I was short. I loved watching the theatrics and the intense pace of the game. Sometimes there was nothing better than going to a hoop and shooting baskets and dribbling around. It was a type of therapy for me.\n\nThe day after my birthday, I brought my basketball to school. I wanted to shoot some hoops during recess. After only a few shots, a big kid came up to me and snatched the ball away from me with strong force. At that moment, something surged within me. It was a rage I had never known. It must have been cultivating within me through the years of bullying and mocking. Without a thought, I punched the kid in the face as hard as I could. It seemed like an uncontrolled force made me do it—purely out of instinct. All the pain and shame I felt powered my punch, and knocked the kid down into a crying fit.\n\nThe principal called my mother in a calm voice and informed her of my actions. My mother seemed indifferent about it, and thought it was best that I fought back. I think she was right, because after this fight, no one bothered to bully me again, until middle school. But that is another story.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the most important lesson you've learned in life?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " One summer during the World War at War Camp Community Service, I was in charge of a playground in West Virginia.\n\nStanding out conspicuously in my impressions of that summer’s experiences is a family whom I will call the Berrys. The two lads, about ten and twelve, who first presented themselves to my acquaintanceship, were perfect little Ishmaelites—their hand against everybody and every man’s hand against them. Teachers of the neighborhood said that their school record was simply an annual repetition of suspensions and expulsions. They would present themselves regularly in September all spic and span with clean shirts, clean, if patched trousers, and clean eager faces for the year’s start; but something always happened before the first lap of the course was run, and everybody thought themselves lucky if October found them still on “praying ground where even the vilest sinner may return.”\n\nThey were rather shy on the playground, especially when other children were there having a good time. Decidedly anti-social, they would slip in after the gates were shut and the swings locked, pick or break the locks to enjoy criminally what they might have had freely by simply being in the current with other people. They were never openly and bravely bad—they were only bad as rats are bad—with a passion and a genius for getting around all constituted authority. They would delight in climbing a hill overlooking the playground where they would roll down boulders and huge stones that came crashing to a full stop just outside the limits of my jurisdiction. I noticed that their bedevilment was peculiarly voiceless. Most urchins of that type would be ready to sing out in fiendish glee when they thought they had you wrought up to a charming pitch of impotent rage. Not so with the Berry boys. In fact, they resembled nothing more than the silent little old men of the mountains; and if you uttered the word “police!” the whole panorama would disappear so quickly, vanishing so completely you would imagine it had all been a horrid nightmare.\n\nOne day, when I was almost alone on the playground in consequence of a steady drizzle all forenoon, I noticed a forlorn little figure with a pair of big round mellow eyes peeping at me through chinks in the palings. As I started down to speak to her, the frightened little creature, a child of five or six, made a dash as though she would run away. I coaxed her in and putting her in one of the little folks’ swings, stood by giving her a gentle push now and then, an excitement that she enjoyed very much. Though she said nothing, one could read her gratitude in those lustrous round eyes—her joy was too deep for utterance. Alas, short lived joy! A tall soldier lad in khaki, puttees, and an overseas cap, came stalking up the walk. Without recognizing me or uttering a word, he took a position at the rear where he caught the eye of the little mite in the swing. The effect was electrical. The child fell out of the swing as if she had been shot! And pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, as fast as her little legs could carry her she flew, neither looking back nor waving goodbye. Startled out of my Olympian calm, I turned on the stranger and demanded to know what was the matter.\n\n“Meh wants her hom,” he replied sententiously.\n\n“Yes? but why didn’t you say your mother and father sent for her? You haven’t said a word!”\n\n“She know what I mean.”\n\n“Perhaps! But it isn’t right for you to deal in dumb signs in conveying what you mean. You owe that child the English language. You are grown and have traveled. You can express yourself and interest her in the wonderful world outside that you have had glimpses of. She will never be anything but a dumb, shut-in creature unless you make opportunities for her to cultivate human speech!”\n\nMore of the same sort I poured forth out of a full heart from my accustomed store. What struck me all the time I was talking was the unbroken stolidity with which my bursts of eloquence were received. He showed neither resentment at the lambasting I gave him nor a gleam of appreciation that was fairly well done for a woman. He was chewing a bit of wheat straw pulled in the field and regarded me with the patient, passionless eyes of a yoke of oxen at the end of a furrow when the day is done. Finally, in sheer desperation at getting no response, I turned on my heel and left him. Reaching down, he pulled another bit of straw which he caught in his teeth and stalked out as he had stalked in. My notebook records this day: “Encounter with the oldest and youngest of the Berry family.”\n\nAct II, Scene 1, discovers me in the midst of my basket weavers, reed and raffia all around and busy little fingers holding up mats and baskets in various stages of imperfection—all clamoring to be set right and shown how at the same instant. Walter Berry, the younger of the two tormentors I had known from the first on the playground, now becoming less shy and perhaps, too, a little less savage, was hovering near the background, evidently struggling with something he wanted to say but having a hard time getting it out. At last he sidled up, and speaking over my shoulder from behind me, managed to blurt out desperately:\n\n“Mith Coo’ show—I make bick too!”\n\n“Why certainly, Walter,“ I said with ready comprehension. “I’ll be glad to show you how to make a basket,” speaking distinctly and letting him observe the motion of my lips in pronouncing “basket.” “You must try to come every day and you have to take lots of pains, you know. But it will be real nice to make a basket for your mother. Don’t you think so?”\n\nWell, from that day until the end of my stay, I was taming Walter and incidentally getting a basket ready to present to his mother. Not infrequently, I had to take out at night what Walter had put in by day so as to have him start right the next day, but on the whole the basket, between us, got on amazingly well and I determined to use it as a card of introduction to Mrs. Berry the “Meh” of whom I had heard much about but never seen. Accordingly, armed with my playground products, I fared forth to break the ice and force a passage into some homes I had never succeeded in luring out to any of our many tempting “occasions” at the playground.\n\nMrs. Berry’s was my first coup de main. The house was at the top of a high hill with more steps to climb to reach the porch which spanned a plain but scrupulously neat living room. The floor was freshly scrubbed with white sand, there was a deal table also scrubbed to snowy whiteness and a few splint-bottomed chairs scrubbed likewise. All this I noticed standing on the threshold of the front door which stood wide open from habit, one could see, rather than with any notion of inviting wayfarers to enter. I knocked on the floor with the point of my umbrella and after some minutes a comely little black woman appeared in the doorway just opposite and stood with hands crossed in front of her, waiting to learn the cause of the intrusion.\n\n“Oh,” I said with an ingratiating smile; “This is Mrs. Berry, is it not? I am Mrs. Cooper, Walter’s teacher on the playground. I came to bring you a little basket that Walter made for you—I taught him how,” I added truthfully. “Rather pretty don’t you think?”\n\nAppealingly now—for I was becoming a wee bit fazed, for the lady held her pose of dignified aloofness in queenly silence. She might have been an artist’s conception of Juno just after that goatherd Paris had pinned the blue ribbon on his amorous little charmer. She did not frown, neither did she beam a smile. She did not ask me in nor say that she was glad I brought the basket. She did not make a pretense of thanking me for any interest I had taken in Walter, nor did she try to act out the lie that she was glad to meet me, and yet with it all her manner was singularly free from active repulsion. Bryon’s line comes to mind: “I seek to shun, not hate mankind,” and yet Bryon’s misanthropy was a pose put on to write about it, and the curl of his patrician lip, the négligé of his open collar and the somber lilt of his dreamy eyes were sedulously cultivated before the mirror by all the dudes and dandies in New York and London. But here in this solitary little woman was something that was no pose, something, I felt instinctively, too sacred for prying eyes and inquisitive “investigators.” She stood and appraised me with that same unfrowning eye I had noticed in her first born that made you think of uncomplaining oxen, too strong to weep, too weighted down to smile.\n\nAfter a while, she parted her lips—and this is what she said: “I keep to myself; I don’ want nothin’ to do wit nobody.” Her tone was even and clear without the slightest suspicion of hysteria or overwrought emotion. The words might have been borne in from a disembodied spirit, so passionless were they, so sublimated, so purified of the tenseness and dross of the physical and earthly.\n\n“But Mrs. Berry,“ I persisted, “You can’t live that way! You can’t be in the world without having something to do with other people!”\n\n“I been living’ that way longer’n you been livin’ yo’ way,” she rejoined, “I’m older’n you.” (She was not at all; but a comparatively young woman.) I accepted the compliment without debate, however, and tried by the most beguiling arts I knew to entice her out of her solitude. After using all the illustrations and arguments I could think of to suggest the interdependence of man on man, I was rewarded by seeing the merest ghost of a smile flit across her countenance, more like the quivering gleam of faraway lightning than the steady radiance of sunlight and dawn. We were still standing where I could look out from the threshold of the porch on the muddy water of the Ohio River.\n\n“There’s nothing you could get to eat,” I continued, “without calling in someone to help you out. You can go to the river and fish—”\n\n“And then I’d have to have lard to cook ’em wit,” she put in brightly.\n\nGood! I knew I had struck fire and we were friends at last.\n\nAs I came down the steps, she called out almost shamefastly, “When you come again, come to see me!”\n\n“Oh, no,” I bantered—“you don’t want to see anybody!”\n\n“Well, if all was like you,” she answered dismally.\n\nIt was not until I had left that I understood the tragedy of Mrs. Berry’s grim struggle with life. Her husband, an innocent man, had been torn from her arms by an infuriated mob and brutally murdered—lynched. The town realized its mistake afterwards when the true culprit confessed, but it was too late to bind up that broken family, and the humble drama of that obscure black woman like a wounded animal with her cubs digging herself in and then at bay dumbly turning to face America, her “head bloody but unbowed,” I swear the pathos and inexorable fatefulness of that titanic struggle—an inescapable one in the clash of American forces, is worthy an epic for its heroic grandeur and unconquerable grit!\n\nAnd I wondered what our brand of education, what our smug injunction that the home “is expected” to cooperate with the school will find or from American environmental conditions as are the blind fish in the mammoth cave or the broncos of the western plains.\n\nA problem—will isolation solve it?###"}
{"prompt": "How did chess help one student realize his true potential?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I was the fool at school, a member of the “dumb class,” the mentally challenged. I was branded as incompetent in a politically-correct way: a special needs student. Apparently, because I was not interested in school, did not care for my grades, and took a more creative approach to homework, I was termed as such.\n\nOver time, I started to believe in my stupidity. I absorbed the fact that I was in special needs classes in high school and regurgitated it out as anger and depression. But one activity changed this view of myself: chess.\n\nI started to play chess with my father after school because I wanted to beat him at something. It was as simple as that. My father was a smart man, fond of physics, writing, spirituality—almost every discipline. He was called a walking dictionary. So, winning in chess against my father would be a sign that I had intellectual power. In that limited field, 64 squares, I had a chance to overcome my so-called inability.\n\nGame after game, I wanted to beat my father even more. I started to study chess books and play against a chess computer to beef up my skills. One weekend, I checkmated my father while we were on a ferry ride to Port Townsend. It made me feel ecstatic.\n\nFast forward two years and some months, and I am the second board on my high school chess team, with our top board being the best high school player in the state. There was an exhibition match held before the tournament season, and our top player could not come. It was my chance to play as top board against the best high school players in the state.\n\nI was determined to show who I had become: an intelligent person able to win with calculation, logic, and will. My most memorable game came in the fourth round. Our team was facing a preparatory school where only elite students attended. It was essentially a match up between a special needs student and a rich valedictorian. I was playing the black pieces and played my usual double fianchetto King’s Indian Defense. The valedictorian was playing well and I was holding onto a little less than equality in the position. He kept attacking and I kept defending, finding hidden resources to keep my king safe. After he thought long about how to take me down, his clock was almost spent. He tried to break down my kingside defense, but could not find the final push. His time was almost up and he started to make rapid moves. I returned with more defensive maneuvers and tried to make it as difficult for him as possible. Before he could make the final deliberation, he lost on time. Honest to God, as his clock flag fell, I leaped up out of my seat and kissed the floor out of excitement. Of course it was not the most sportsmen-like behavior, but I could not contain my emotions.\n\nI went on to draw my last game against the first board from the top-standing high school for chess in the state, and had achieved a lossless result with three wins and two draws. While holding my winner’s trophy at the end, I knew I was not stupid. The stigmatization had melted away, and I realized that underneath our thoughts, each person is a genius.###"}
{"prompt": "What is your earliest memory?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First memories of oneself can be easily confused with fabricated memories made by looking at old pictures, movies, and hearing stories related to one’s personal history. This is the case for me: I have seen so many home movies, heard so many stories about myself, and seen so many pictures about my early childhood, I do not know for certain what my first memory is in actuality. Since I cannot pinpoint my first memory exactly, I will unfold a series of memories that were the earliest in my childhood.\n\nI remember at night looking through the large glass windows of our living room at the huge pine trees and douglas fir trees, which brushed against our white fence. The trees would sway sometimes violently in the wind, as it was common in Seattle at night. I would watch the trees dance, believing to see many frightening and strange shapes forming in the dark, as if the trees were alive in a conscious way. The trees would shift into the types of monsters my imagination dreamed up. I would tell my mother about the shapes and forms, but as a common mother would do, she tried to calm me down instead of play along with my eerie fixation.\n\nAnother sharp early memory of mine was when I examined my body. I was curious, as most children are, about the texture and form of the body we are given at birth. From an early age, I had four operations: two open heart surgeries, and two hernia surgeries. I would feel my scars, which scale up my chest and travel near my groin as if they were landscapes, burned into my skin until age would fade them away. Besides scars, I would relish over the smallest of particulars about my eyes, which have hazel lines shooting out from the pupils. I would examine my life state through my eyes: I could see how I was on the whole through them. My hands were also a point of curiosity for me: my left hand is significantly smaller than my right hand because of surgeries. Comparing them was and still is a bit of a fetish of mine.\n\nI learned to ride a bicycle quite early, though I do not remember the exact age. My father was a professional cyclist at one point, and he wanted his son to be keen in the sport as well. But I remember my first attempt to ride a bicycle without training wheels ending disastrously and humorously. Out on the main street next to our house, where there were almost no cars driving around back then due to less population, I started out okay on a small child-bike. My balance was fine from the start, but then I got overexcited and lost my balance, eventually smashing into our mailbox. Though my dad was concerned about my safety at first, after he saw that nothing serious had happened to me, he laughed without hesitation and was poking fun at me. I did not feel discouraged—in fact, I was laughing along after a few seconds.\n\nI have many more scattered memories that could count as first memories, even though they are mixed in with my impressions from watching home movies, seeing pictures, and hearing stories about my childhood. We may not know our first memory for certain, but once we try to dig it up, the world we lived in as a child begins to pour through the lens of visual thought, bringing back the atmosphere of this time into the present moment, like an incense smoke that softly curls around our present senses.###"}

I was with my long-time friend, Janu, and his mother, staying in a hotel for a few days. The vacation so far was the embodiment of relaxing: eating fresh mangoes, waking up late, dining out all the time (mostly fish curry), swimming a few times a day in the Indian ocean, and joking around with old pals.\n\nAround three in the afternoon on a cloudless day, the beach on our side was empty of people besides my friend, his mother, and I. It was freeing to be alone on this vast beach, known to be a holy place among Hindus. Ganapatipule is named after the god Ganesh, and there is a famous Ganesh shrine near there where a swayambhu (a sculpture erected from the earth itself in the form of a god) is worshiped. Bathing in the ocean around this area is supposed to cleanse people of their negativity and visiting the shrine also purifies individuals as well.\n\nAs I started to swim in the warm ocean, jumping over waves, I left my friends behind. I was wearing a white kurta, or a traditional garb for men in India, which was heavy in the water, but my feet was easily touching the ocean floor at all times. I usually washed my clothes by swimming in the ocean when I was there.\n\nBut at one instant, I felt that my feet could not touch the ocean floor anymore and I plunged into the water, weighted down by my clothes. The waves kept coming and now they were menacing, as I was getting sucked into the depths every time they came—even if I rose out of the water and tried to swim back to the part of the ocean where I could get a foothold. I had been sucked into a riptide, in fact, and was stuck in a dipping valley, despite my hard efforts to reach safety and my yelling to my friends in the distance.\n\nAfter struggling heavily for a few, long minutes to go against the suction of the riptide, and shouting to my friends in the distance near the shore to no avail, I began to relax, accepting my fate. I no longer fought to reach the edge of the ocean valley to get a foothold, and in the process of being pulled into the ocean and coming back up to the surface, I talked to God out loud. I discussed what I had did wrong in my life and what I did right. I concluded in reflection that my life was fulfilling overall, and I felt ready to die, accepting the present circumstance as reality.\n\nYet as soon I surrendered myself to the situation, a huge wave came and pushed me out of the riptide and the deep valley I was sucked into. On the drift of the wave, I landed near my friends, who seemed astonished at my expression and my words of description. They were unaware that I had been trouble. But it did not matter at the time—I was happy to reach land again and felt my life was renewed.\n\nI later learned the time I swam was inauspicious for swimming at Ganapatipule, as the natives believe the god Ganesh bathes around three in afternoon in the ocean there. It was as if Ganesh forgave me for the intrusion, and released me from the anger of the ocean against divine protocol.###"}
{"prompt": "What was your most memorable experience while climbing a mountain?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If you have ever climbed a mountain, you know how exciting it is to realize you are about to get on top of one of the world’s roofs—especially for the first time when you do not yet know what to expect or how it is going to be like.\n\nI can remember my first ascension to a mountain top well. It happened about three years ago, when it was autumn, and the weather in the mountains was gloomy. My friends offered me to travel to the western Carpathian Mountains, and after a short period of hesitation, I accepted their invitation. There was nothing much to do for me at the time, so I thought a change of surrounding would only be of use to me.\n\nThe Carpathian Mountains are not too high. If you compare them to, say, the Caucasian Mountains, the Carpathians look more like hills—although on average, they are about 4500 feet high. Anyways, this is more than enough for a novice, and I am glad my experience of climbing mountains started there.\n\nThe hillside we started our ascension from was rather sloping, in the beginning. This side of the mountain was covered with a pine forest. The trees were incredibly high and thick; their knotted large roots cut the ground here and there, forming natural footsteps, making walking the terrain a little bit easier. The air was fresh and clean; after about 30 minutes of climbing, we heard the sound of a stream and rushed to it for a drink. I think it was the tastiest water in my life: it smelled of moss and soil, was subtly sweet, and was so cold and clear—dipping our stained hands in it seemed almost a crime.\n\nAfter about an hour of walking, we left the forest, and walked along the slope, overgrown with shrubs. The ground beneath our feet changed its color, but we did not pay attention to it, until it started to rain slightly; after it became slippery, and one of our friends fell because of this, we realized we were walking on clay. Fortunately, there was a plateau a bit higher, and somehow we managed to reach it; still, our clothes were covered with clay. Further, the slope gradually became steeper, so instead of walking, we had to climb. Instead of clay, there were mostly stones and branches, and we could grab the shrubs nearby to help ourselves climb. There was another small plateau on our way to the top; on this plateau, we found many wild blueberries and strawberries, which were delicious.\n\nWhen we ultimately got to the top, we did not realize it at first because of the cloudy and foggy weather. The rain stopped, but we could still barely see our surroundings, so we felt disappointed but nevertheless happy because of making it to the top. We had a teapot and a touristic primer with us, so we made some hot tea, and drank it, discussing where else we would go next time. And suddenly, when we were ready to leave, the sun somehow broke through the clouds, and cast the fog away. We were awed to see the incredible scenery below: green misty valleys, shady mountains around, and a shining serpent of a distant river. Amazed, we stood there for about five minutes, before the sun hid behind the clouds again. But these five minutes made us feel much happier than if we saw all the scenery while climbing the mountain.\n\nIn the following years, I climbed several more mountains. Though rarely something extreme happened, I still feel happy and proud for discovering more mountains firsthand. But I guess I never again had the same feeling as at that very moment when the clouds vanished and revealed the whole world below the first mountain I climbed.###"}
{"prompt": "What is your attitude towards loneliness and why?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is your attitude towards loneliness? Do you think it is a curse when you are isolated from the rest of the world, left face-to-face with yourself? Or do you, on the contrary, seek it, appreciating each moment of silence you can snatch from the surrounding world? These small breaks can help you replenish your energy and reorganize your thoughts, so that you can start each day as a new one—not as an extension of a previous one. As for me, I am more of the second kind of person; solitude for me is a gift, which is valued less by people than it should be accorded.\n\nIn my childhood and teen years, I had a perfect place to go to when I felt like being on my own. In a small town in the center of America, where I lived back then, we had a steep hill on the outskirts. On its top, an old warehouse stood. No one, even older people, seemed to know who built that warehouse in such an inconvenient place, and what for. Some said smugglers used it during World War II for their own purposes; others told stories about local slaveholders who lived in our town a long time ago—those people were thought to have kept slaves in the old warehouse. For us children, that old wooden shack was a haunted place with a grim, bloody story of love and treason.\n\nNone of the townsmen had ever visited the old warehouse. Children were scared and adults did not feel like climbing up the steep slope for no reason. For most of the year, I was its only visitor. With my legs dangling from the attic’s crossbar, usually with an apple in my hand, I watched the sunsets and sunrises, and tiny ants running here and there, and the birds in a nest above my head (for some reason, they were not afraid of me), and the life beneath my outlook point. During such moments, what was meaningful to me was only what I could see, hear, touch, or smell. My school worries, arguments with friends, unrequited first love, and even Mrs. Finch’s cat that I accidentally ran over by my bicycle—all this, as well as many other things—did not exist. And now, when I reminisce about my childhood, I remember the warm golden light, soft shades in the attic, a smell of fresh hay, and the tile rooftops of my town.\n\nSometimes, as I visited the warehouse, I met other people there. Usually they were vagabonds, staying for a couple of days before moving ahead, or seasonal workers traveling across the entire country further to the west. When this happened, I behaved like a cautious animal, and fortunately I never had problems with them. If they stayed long enough, I would bring them some canned food, and in exchange, they told me their stories, or joked with me. I heard stories of loneliness and long railway trails; unpaid labor and failed marriages; crashed hopes and vehement dreams. In their voices, I could hear the wisdom and the ignorance of the world. They shared their fears, their grief, or their joy with a 13-year-old kid from an American no-name remoteness, knowing he will not spill the beans. Or even if I would (though I never did), still they saw me for the first and last time in their lives.\n\nI believe that old warehouse determined my life. The destinies of other people—perplexed, complicated, but at the same time keen and full of real life—helped me understand myself and the world around me, providing me with answers to issues that worry teenagers. Who am I? Why is everything as it is? Who are the people around me? What should I do? How should I treat others? Those vagabonds, those people, whom people in our town contemptuously called “low-lives,” they taught me things much more valuable than what I could study in vaunted universities.\n\nI still enjoy solitude, when I have a free minute. And, just like in my adolescence, I enjoy the company of unfamiliar random people, who appear in my life for several moments: in an airplane, in train, in a hitch, in a cafe. They tell me their stories and leave—and I carefully write them down….\n\nI am a writer, you know.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the pros and cons of living in a city?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I like the saying: “The grass is always greener on the other side.” To me, it means we tend to believe life in places different from our residence is for some reason better. Considering this, I have tried to be content with the place I resided in throughout my life: a regular city in the center of the United States. However, due to various circumstances that would take too much time to describe here, I started to think about changing my life and moving to another area. And, to start with, I attempted to figure out where I wanted to live, in all sincerity.\n\nWhile living in a city, I discovered that perhaps the most irritating factor for me was the rush and the amounts of unnecessary information I encountered. Every morning, I witnessed crowds of people hurrying, having quick snacks while leaping from one office to another, glancing at their watches frantically. Every day, I was seeing placards, billboards, TV commercials, and advertising products I had completely no need for. There was no escape from it, because commercials were seemingly everywhere: in search engines, in my mailbox, in YouTube clips, in every printed or electronic material. Whenever I browsed on the Internet for information on topics of interest, I had to wade through tons of informational garbage.\n\n“The place I choose to live will be calm and won’t cause me stress,” I said to myself, and kept on thinking.\n\nFrom my early childhood, I loved mountains. When I was taken to the Yellowstone National Park by my parents for the first time, I was literally shocked by the greatness of nature and the amazing feeling of freedom and height. Since that time, I kept on visiting Yellowstone annually; I have also traveled to several mountainous regions of the U.S. and Europe. Every time I was walking up or standing on the top of a mountain, I wondered: do people living in such places have the same problems as city dwellers? Can a person who can witness the enormous misty mountain silhouettes in their window each morning really be miserable and petty?\n\n“Mountains—that is where I need to live,” I said to myself, and kept on looking with my intuition.\n\nI was making my decision for a couple more months. During this period, I made solid efforts to recall the most pleasant memories about places I have been to, and to realize my needs concerning a way of life, occupation, communication, geographical location, and so on. I would stop on a certain variant as the final one, and the next day I would reconsider it. Among the places I thought of were Italy, Norway, Peru, and even exotic countries for a westerner to live in, such as China and Nepal. But, after a period of intense consideration, I had finally stopped searching and chose Scotland—Aberdeenshire, in particular. It looked exactly like what I needed: mountainous region, nice people, suitable climate (well, suitable for me, since Scottish climate is rather fickle), the English language being spoken, and both modern civilization and countless opportunities for seclusion and resort.\n\n“Well, seems like I’ve found a perfect place for myself to live,” I said to myself, and started to arrange the formalities. But that is a completely different story.###"}
{"prompt": "How would you change your life if you could go back in time?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " One of the most popular topics in the history of science-fiction has been the idea of time travel. In literature and cinema, this topic has been exploited uncountable times. We know and love such works as H.G. Wells’ “Time Machine”; H.P. Lovecraft’s “The Shadow Out of Time”; Bradbury’s “A Sound of Thunder”; King’s “The Langoliers”; as well as numerous films and TV shows: “Back to the Future,” “Butterfly Effect,” and “Timecop.” These, as well as many others are dedicated mostly to one question: how can an individual affect or even change his or her entire life in the present by making even slight corrections in his or her own past? In my opinion, this is one of the most common, natural, and essential questions.\n\nWhen I was a child, I often dreamed about a special pocket device that would allow me to “save” certain moments of my life, so that in case I failed to do something, I could always “load” my life from a checkpoint, already possessing a certain level of experience—exactly how they do it in video games. I imagined the things I could do if I had such power: jumping from skyscrapers without a parachute (and “loading” in the last second); traveling across savannas, jungles, and deserts; racing and performing other risky occupations. I especially liked to think about saving people from desperate and dangerous situations when others could not help; I guess every boy dreams of being a superhero, and I was no exception.\n\nAs I grew older, my life experience gradually became more diverse. In many situations, I had no idea how to act properly, what decisions to make, what path to follow; naturally, I made mistakes. While many of my actions back then turned out for the good in the future, some mistakes provided for many painful moments for me and people around me. Mistakes are inevitable, but they allow us to learn, develop ourselves, and motivate us to change for the better—and still sometimes I would like to leap into a time machine, go back a couple of years ago, and make corrections.\n\nWould I try to make other people act in a different way? I think no. I would rather warn myself about the awaiting consequences of my most reckless decisions. I would talk to a long-haired teen holding his first cigarette and tell him: “Don’t do that—years will pass until you finally manage to quit.” Or: “Man, don’t go there—you don’t need to see what is going on in that place tonight.” “Whoa! Don’t drive so fast, pal!” Perhaps, one of the most important warnings would be: “Don’t push her away now—you could be happy together.” So many warnings I would give to myself that sometimes I think: was it really me who did this and that?\n\nHaving a time machine is an amazingly attractive idea. It seems having one would make life so much easier! Perhaps, it is true. But what I think more often now is that living without this aggregate teaches us responsibility. This is perhaps the most important responsibility: about oneself, about important people to us, about one’s own life, which is the only one we have. And besides, our mistakes make us what we are today. Today I am a person leading a healthy, active lifestyle; I care about my friends and family; I think about my share of responsibility in everything that is going on in my life; I try to live each day at the maximum in order to regret nothing.\n\nIf I could go back in time, I would try to make my future better. This is what our parents always try to do when we are children. But you know what? I am glad that no time machine has been invented.###"}
{"prompt": "How does it feel to have a termless vacation?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The first day of your termless vacation feels almost like the first day on a new unexplored planet; suddenly, you realize you have left a significant piece of your former life behind. When you are a colonist arriving to a new world, you leave behind your failed marriage, debts, and dark past; when you are an office worker, you leave behind a Xerox machine and a bunch of passwords. But it all does not matter anymore, because you are already not there, you are here, like a child in the first week of a wonderfully long summer holiday.\n\nSo, the first thing you do is throw off the shackles. People do it in many ways, but your method is to breath deeper than usual, and recall the sensation of sunshine—sunshine in the crowns of old sycamores. Also, you may remember the smells of childhood: peeled blue paint on the porch door, big fat woman with curlers, whom all the kids in town were afraid of, and who always threw dirty, wet rags at them.\n\nThrowing off the shackles…. Dear God, you could not even imagine how much rubbish you’ve been carrying inside of you until this first day of your new life. From time to time, you look at all this trash, all these far-fetched mental constructions that have been running your existence all this time. Now you can easily throw them away as well.\n\nAnd so, lying on a beach, staring in the turquoise and hot summer sky with just one perfectly-shaped cloud in it, and listening to the sweet rhythmic humming created by the wind and the sea, you understand that there are no thoughts in your head at all, and no inner voices demand your attention. Complete silence and calmness. Zen. Samadhi.\n\nSamadhi of an office worker and Samadhi of some orange-garbed Nepalese Buddhist monk in a mountain temple. No difference. No sense. Nothing.\n\nNothing is everything. Everything any of us needs.\n\nA little bit of Nothing for everybody.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the most breathtaking experience you have ever had?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Since I am a high school student, somebody might say I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which I am sure I will carry with me until my last days: my first hike to the mountains.\n\nThough traveling is not a big deal for me today, before my trip to the mountains, I used to be a homebody. I had friends to hang out with, several hobbies, and I felt completely comfortable spending weeks or even months in my hometown—or sometimes even on my block—without going anywhere. All my demands of novelty were satisfied by the Discovery and National Geographic channels, and I seriously thought there was no difference between seeing something on the TV or with one’s own eyes.\n\nThe situation changed when one day David, my best pal who always has a couple of colorful bugs in his head (or, in other words, was always carrying out several crazy plans at once) tumbled into my room and proclaimed his disgust for civilization. I will not describe how he managed to persuade me to join him on his journey to the Rocky Mountains; all I will say is we departed in five days.\n\nThis was my first time in the mountains, so I was turning my head in all directions. Unfortunately, the weather was foggy most the time, and the higher we got into the mountains, the worse the visibility was. Even despite this fact, I still enjoyed the hike—I felt like I was Bear Grylls, whose show I used to watch with excitement: in the wild, with food and water in my backpack, carrying a flashlight and a knife. On the first day, we were making our way along the foothills; but the next day, we started to climb on one of the peaks. Though it was not that steep and high, I was still excited. I regularly hastened, and because of that, I ran out of energy long before we got to the top; David, on the other hand was more well-paced.\n\nWhen we finally got to the top, nothing had changed. The same fog was covering the surroundings, and even though I was teeming with positive emotions, I felt disappointed, because I counted on seeing the view from above and perhaps being able to take some photos. We spent a couple of hours on the top, and decided to turn back, when the wind suddenly dispersed the clouds, and the plateau we were standing on became illuminated with the sun. I saw a fantastic panorama in front of me, and for some moments, I couldn’t believe my eyes. Seeing all those mountain ridges, cliffs, and edges on my own, not on TV, was like a revelation for me. The strong wind blew right into my face, and I stood there and watched shreds of fog gliding over the ground far beneath me. At that moment, I realized that I won’t be able to live a life without visiting the mountains at least a few times a year.\n\nThe next day we returned—my legs started to hurt so bad that I could hardly walk. But every time as my face wrinkled because of an ache, I remembered the feeling of being high above, with my head touching the skies and the clouds swimming below.###"}
{"prompt": "What is life like in the 22nd century?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " We have become much different than what we were considered before by history. By “we” I mean humankind, and by “today” I mean the year 2184. I am writing this for the descendants; I am not an idealist and do not build shiny illusions for myself, but perhaps they will find another way of development and evolution than we had. Perhaps they will manage to regain the essence of being human.\n\nWhat is life like in the 22nd century? Well, it is unquestionably different than even a hundred years ago. The main driving force of the present time is technology; technological wonders have become so diverse and incredible that some people already treat them the same way as our ancestors treated magic. They even worship technologies. Every major city of the most advanced countries, such as China and Saudi Arabia, now have a temple where adepts can unite with the Machine Soul. But let me get back to the subject. Three phenomenons define our lives today: space flights, cybernetics, and immortality.\n\nOne of the most significant issues—the overpopulation of Earth—was solved when space flights became a common practice. I do not know the technicalities, but when scientists finally discovered anti-matter in 2067 and learned to use it for practical purposes, it took governments much less money and effort to initiate space programs and launch spacecrafts to the Moon and Mars. Today, the Moon is almost as overpopulated as Earth was in the beginning of the previous century; as for Mars, a 23rd colony was settled on its surface a couple of months ago.\n\nCybernetics is an another pillar of modern civilization. Since the first cybernetic implants were released on the global market in 2098, it has become a great help for disabled people, as well as for those who want to enhance their natural capabilities with special implants. Terminal diseases are no longer a threat; only mental disorders remain a serious problem. Today, you cannot imagine a cop without cybernatically-strengthened limbs, or a stockbroker without brain implants helping him or her process complex calculations in no time. And though in the middle of the 21st century, there were prognoses about the development of robotics, today, as people have become much more efficient, no one thinks about robots.\n\nIn addition, cybernetics gave people a possibility to resurrect after death. Yes, humanity has completely overcome death. It occurred in 2131, when academician Kurt Liebknecht, who is now considered a saint, had discovered a way to store human minds on hard disks. Each human being today literally works for their immortality throughout their lifetimes. If you manage to save enough money, you can transfer your mind onto the Internet, and exist online in the form of pure information. IT specialists and scientists have invented special, secure Necropolises for such people—virtual places where the Immortals reside. Those who would like to resurrect in their physical bodies once again can “work”: do system administering, manage databases, provide online security (IP, Internet Police), and so on. For their job, they earn virtual money—the virtual economy has become as developed and significant as the real one—and buy themselves cybernetic bodies, in which their minds are transplanted back from online. Well, Immortals are not truly immortal; we all remember the horrible tragedy in 2152, when three of the largest servers containing Necropolises were hacked and reformatted by the terrorists from Humanity-1—at least, it was the official version. Hundreds of thousands of Immortals back then had vanished forever—my brother was among them.\n\nThe invention of an online afterlife has also solved the problem of prisons: criminal minds are now being locked in special virtual storage, and their physical bodies are used for organ transplants for the living, or utilized in other ways. Though, a new problem had arisen: escaped convicts pose a threat both for the Immortals in the virtual world and for systems and people in real life. When a living criminal connects to the Internet through a brain chip, such criminals, usually called Incubuses, can possess them, capturing their bodies and expelling, or even destroying their minds. And though a large number of security programs are now available for Internet users, and though the IP constantly hunts and deciphers (or destroys, simply saying) loose criminals, Incubuses remain a serious threat.\n\nTechnological wonders we take for granted today are much more diverse and numerous than I have described so far. The Epoch of the Machine Soul is an exciting time to live in. The only question that worries or even scares me and many other conscious and intelligent people today, is: “Are we still human? What are we now?”###"}
{"prompt": "What was the result of Jack's encounter with the couple?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jack had a disastrous week. His personal world seemed to be breaking into scraps—the last thing he wanted to do was wake up early and go to work. But that was exactly what Jack had to do. Drowsy and having no enthusiasm about working on a Wednesday, he left his claustrophobic-inducing apartment, and wormed his way into a crowded, sultry bus, dozing off while leaning against a sweaty handrail. In his dream, he was lying on a river shore, unemployed, but free.\n\nThe sudden hiss of the bus door opening awoke him, and he noticed it was his stop; he hurriedly rolled out of the bus, coughing as exhaust poured over him. Not the best beginning of the day… well, nothing new, he thought.\n\nJack’s work day began in about 30 minutes, so he decided to take a walk around the block to try to gather his senses and adjust himself to another nettlesome day. His existence was not so decrepit as it could seem—he was a decent guy with an abundance of friends and hobbies, a tolerable job, and reasonable plans for the future. But for some reason, this August had been too harsh for him, and he felt off his rails.\n\nWhile wandering, he ran into a couple: a young man and woman talking to each other in a foreign language. Jack decided the language they were speaking was Russian. Tourists, he thought, and they were going to pass by, but the woman called to him in crooked English:\n\n“Excuze me! Could help us prease?”\n\nHer pronunciation was horrible—just like the ones you can hear in Hollywood movies about Russian mafias.\n\n“Yes, how can I help you?”\n\n“We are tourist, lost. Need “Dolphin” hotel. You know where is?”\n\nShe was visibly courageous as she waded through the jungle marsh of a foreign language.\n\n“I’m sorry, I don’t know. I beg your pardon… I’m in a hurry,” Jack said, and moved off. He wasn’t in a hurry at all, and he knew where the hotel was (a couple of blocks away, actually), but he was so delved into his problems and his bad mood that he lied mechanically. He felt sullied with guilt; after walking about 100 feet, he turned back: luckily, the couple was still there. They looked bewildered… he imagined himself being in a city as huge as New York for the first time, knowing only a couple of English words, and shivered. He walked up to them.\n\n“I remembered where the “Dolphin” hotel is. I’m sorry, I just got confused: there are hundreds of hotels in New York. It’s not far from here: you can walk there by feet. You need to go straight to that crossroad, then turn right, and walk about 500 feet more. There you will see an old catholic church, and a Burger King. Turn to the left, cross the road, and walk down the street till you see a white-blue 5-storeyed building. That will be the hotel you’re looking for.”\n\nThe couple thanked him, and Jack left lightly this time. But when he turned his back, he saw the couple was still there, and the look on their faces was the same. Maybe I was talking too quickly, and they couldn’t understand me well enough, he thought. Or maybe they couldn’t remember everything I told them. Man, I should have simply passed by.\n\nAll of a sudden, he felt he could do something more important than sit in his office all day long. He knew he couldn’t leave these young people behind: they needed help, and their English was so poor they could possibly spend the whole day trying to get to the hotel. He walked up to them once again. They looked at him in surprise.\n\n“You know, I have some free time as well,” Jack said. “I could guide you to the hotel, if you still need my help.”\n\nThe man and the woman looked at each other, then at Jack, and then the man smiled.\n\n“Sink you,” he said.\n\nFor the next 40 minutes, Jack listened to the couple’s crooked English, in which they told him stories about their journeys and shared their impressions about New York with him. He found they were lively and amiable, and didn’t hesitate speaking despite their poor English. Soon enough, he could understand them as if they were talking clearly, and even learned a couple of Russian words—mostly expressions of gratitude and delight. When they finally arrived at the hotel, he felt he would like spend some more time with them, show them around, perhaps. The couple gladly agreed to his proposal to guide them through the city streets.\n\nThey exchanged contacts, and Jack hurried to work. For the first time since the beginning of August, he felt sane.###"}
{"prompt": "What does Bryce think of the girl he meets in the woods?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bryce still remembered the smell that permeated in the air that evening: a combination of gingery sweetness of wild flowers, hazelnut pie crust, and ripe raspberries. The smell of a hot summer evening, when the sun had already hidden its rays for the night, but the earth was breathing out the steam of the day fever. That July, two years ago, was particularly hot, humid, and promising to be boring. Having finished his second year in college and planning to spend the summer working in the local amusement park, Bryce was not anticipating any glory. Moreover, most of his college friends had moved out of campus for the summer and traveled back to their homes while he was stuck in Grindson for the whole summer, since this was where he grew up and spent every summer. The goal for the season was to simply stay in town and try to survive the heat of the Central Texas prairie.\n\nThat Tuesday, July seventh, was a regular day like many others. Bryce had worked through his morning shift in the park without a single pause and was already free by five. Having nothing much to do, he decided to take his old green-and-blue Cannondale bike and ride to the little forest just outside Grindson. But first he drove home in his old maroon Ford truck that was getting rustier than maroon every year. The truck was a present from his grandmother and Bryce had loved this piece of steel and rubber dearly ever since he got it for his seventeenth birthday. Selling this truck and buying a vehicle more suited for actual driving never seemed like an option; not because he did not have an answer to the question of who would have to pay real money for this wreck, but because Bryce could not imagine himself spinning the wheel of any other car.\n\nAt home, Bryce took a cold shower, prepared a couple of turkey sandwiches, and cut a few fresh tomatoes from the little backyard garden his mom was so tenderly keeping. He put a couple of water bottles from the fridge into the blue, portable trunk he had bought and welded onto his bike recently. With that done, he put on his headphones and hopped onto his bike. It was a bit past 6pm as Bryce rode through the field of scorched grass and wild daisies, taking a turn left and then continuing along a muddy pond into the woods. The pond was much smaller than two weeks ago when he was last there. As Bryce was riding by the pond, he thought that in a few weeks from now, there probably will not be much else but a swampy puddle left of it if the days continued being hot and the rains kept ignoring this part of the state as if they were mad at the citizens of Lampasas County.\n\nWhen Bryce reached his destination point—a cozy, round plot of grass with soft, natty bells of pink and blue bluebonnets, half-covered with the shadows of the wild Texas Mulberry trees—he was blanketed in sweat and started thinking that going for a ride this time of day was too rash of a decision. Bryce took off his faded green John Deere cap that was wet with perspiration, whisking off the sweat drops from his temples and tousled his short brown hair. His head was spinning—water gave little relief from the thirst and the least he wanted at the moment was that warm flapjack of a sandwich that seemed so delicious a half an hour ago. As Bryce sat on the ground and sipped on a second bottle of water, his plans for a picnic slowly changed into plans for a late afternoon nap. He suddenly felt worn out, as if the heat had completely drained him during this brief bike ride.\n\nBryce lay straight on his back in the shadow of the oldest and bushiest mulberry tree around. This tree had been here for as long as Bryce could remember. When he was a small child, he used to come here with his older brother and once scratched their names on the bark of its trunk.\n\nBryce woke up to the sound of someone’s breath right next to his ear. It took him no more than a second to remember where he was and to look over at the young, tall girl who was sitting cross-legged in front of his face, smiling and eating a mulberry. Bryce sat up on the grass, cleared his throat and mumbled “Hi.” His voice sounded kinked and shaky, like the voice of an irresolute teen boy at the sight of a cute girl. Well, he felt exactly that way. But the girl seemed to have ignored how embarrassed Bryce felt. She serenely stretched out her right arm and offered Bryce a handful of mulberries. The girl was wearing a pair of bright orange trainers, Bermuda shorts and a simple, white tank top. She wore a ponytail to the side and a couple of tiny freckles on each of her cheeks. She was about Bryce’s age, maybe a year younger.\n\nNatasha came across the grass plot some fifteen minutes ago with the idea of wandering. When she noticed the presence of a ruffled young man sleeping under the shade of a tree, she felt inclined to watch him, as if she was studying human nature. His lashes flashed intermittently, and were blazed in light at the right moment when they were tipped with the sun. She thought that that she rarely had the chance to witness someone sleep, to really look at a person without hindrance. After about 20 minutes of examining him, she wanted to wake up her subject. But almost anyone seems like an angel when they are sleeping—she could not persuade herself to prod him to awareness.###"}
{"prompt": "How does the protagonist feel about being forgotten and left to die of thirst and heat?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " It was a blazing summer’s day. My surroundings were slowly starting to melt: the trees, the houses, the sky, and the pathway to my garage. It seemed that I was about to dissipate as well, becoming a puddle of glue-like substance left on the ground.\n\nI was walking at crawling speed. My head felt huge and heavy, and each muscle in my body felt sore. My arms and legs were responding to the signals that my brain was sending to them at a slower speed than I thought was possible. It felt like a slow-motion horror movie, only it was happening live. I finally reached the front door and touched the handle with a loose grip. The path that took only a second for my eyes to see took about twenty minutes for my body to cover. But, I was finally at my goal.\n\nI slowly squeezed the handle of the door in a downwards motion, only to realize it had barely moved. I gathered the last reserves of my strength that I had left in my body and pressed the handle again. No success. I pivoted around, leaned against the door, and slowly slid down to the ground. I felt faint. I was so thirsty that I could barely think about anything else. I had to get inside; had to pull myself together and open the door. Otherwise, I would faint there, near the front entrance to my own house.\n\nI pushed myself up from the ground and faced the door again. I closed my eyes for a second, took a deep breath, opened my eyes, and pulled the door knob down as hard as I could. It gave way grudgingly. If it wasn’t for the helpless shadow of a man that I was at that moment, I would definitely have screamed in happiness for finally winning over this stubborn door knob. But I could only settle on a weak smile and a deep sigh.\n\nI went inside and had to wait for a minute before I could make out my environment. It was too dark, still boiling hot and, somehow, lonely inside. By the time my eyes adapted to the darkness inside, I could tell that no one was around. What time was it? And where was everyone? The house was completely and scarily quiet. The silence was unnatural. There was no sound coming from the working fridge, or ticking clock; nothing. I went to the kitchen to get some water, opened the tap and put an empty glass under it. But no water poured, not even a drop. The glass remained empty. This seemed like a complete nightmare. I thought that I must have been dreaming—my small world had become ravished by emptiness, and somehow, I was forgotten here all alone, left to pass away into the realms of thirst and heat.\n\nI was having a panic attack. Yet with the panic, I was enabled by strength to run from one room to another, looking for anyone besides myself. Mom, Josh, dad, Charlie—no one was to be seen. The dogs were gone too. Again, for the third or fourth time, I caught myself thinking this was just a bad dream. But my body still vividly felt the pains of soreness. Having no clue of what else, except the pain, that could help me distinguish between dreaming and reality, I had to accept the fact that I was living in this nightmare for real.\n\nSuddenly, I heard a sound from downstairs. It was a faint sound that repeated in a second, only louder. I jolted downstairs, feeling cautious and, at the same time, hoping that it was someone, or something, that could explain to me what was going on.\n\nThe living room was empty. The source of the sound seemed to be from the back porch outside, and it was increasing in volume with every new cycle. It reminded me of when dad and I went rowing, and every time dad turned over the oars, they made the same whistling sound, cleaving the air. I ran outside the back door and was almost brought down to the ground by the force of the wind. It was a helicopter, right above me, maneuvering so that it would land on me. I laid on the ground, screaming, but I couldn’t hear my voice through the noise of the implacable blades getting closer, and freezing me to the ground….\n\n… “Jason, honey, wake up! It’s just a dream, babe. You look so pale. Are you okay?”\n\nMy mom was standing next to my bed like a guardian statue. She tried to appease me as I was still screaming and flapping my arms. When I calmed down to a relative level of normalcy, I stared at the fan above my head, spinning and whistling like a nightmare creator.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the best places to travel to in Ukraine?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Travelling has been a longtime passion of mine. Being a photographer, I find seeing unfamiliar places, meeting new people, and getting to know different cultures exceptionally inspiring. By the age of 32, I had already been to the majority of exotic places: the Emirates, Ethiopia, Turkey, India, Laos, Thailand, Japan, Egypt, Malaysia, New Zealand, Australia, and Cuba. So, when a friend of mine who was working as a Peace Corps volunteer in Ukraine invited me to visit him for a couple of weeks, I thought: “Why not?!” I did not know what to expect from Ukraine since I knew little about it. I usually studied up for weeks on the country that I desired to leave to, but I did not have enough time to indulge in this practice—the prices of the plane tickets shot up after a week or so. I knew that it would be an intriguing experience due to the spontaneous nature of my travel.\n\nUkraine turned out to be completely different from any place I had visited so far. A post-Soviet=Union country, it is still struggling to build a developed society. But being a photographer, I was far more interested in its nature, people, and sites than its politics. Ukraine appeared to be an attractive, even gorgeous country. Being slightly smaller than Texas, it is extremely diverse and is full of natural wonders that take your breath away. Kyiv, the capital city, appeared unexpectedly well-groomed, green, and wealthy. Lots of bridges across the Dnipro River, a great number of outstanding parks, a couple of botanical gardens, and many, many flowers everywhere you go. A lot friendlier than you would think. Next, we went to Western Ukraine with its own peculiar culture and atmosphere.\n\nThe Carpathian Mountains are precious and authentic, with small distant villages and little country houses that seem like modern progress will never reach them. An amazingly romantic place! I had been there in late May, but my friend said these mountains are beautiful all year round—a great hiking spot for spring, a tent camp landscape for summer and autumn, with tiny, fast mountain rivers that amazed me with their pureness, and a couple of perfect skiing resorts that do not yield to the Austrian or Canadian ones even a bit. The people of Western Ukraine amazed me as well, especially the elderly—amiable, positive, and active. West Ukraine was basically the first place to which my friend took me, and it made me fall in love with Ukraine completely. From the Carpathians, we traveled to Lviv—a wonderful medieval city that is somewhat similar to Prague, yet it is special in its atmosphere: 800-year-old castles, wooden churches, Gothic catholic temples and palaces, flowers at every corner and on every window seal, original block pavement streets of the Old City (Stare Misto), and lots of people in authentic national clothes—vishivanki (embroidered white shirts). Lviv is a magical city and it fueled me with inspiration to see the rest of the country.\n\nNext, my friend took me to Zaporizhzhya—an eastern city with an impossible to pronounce name and two thousand years of history. The city is built on two banks of the Dnipro River, and has an island in the middle—Khortitsa—the largest river island in the world. The place is exceptionally spiritual—no wonder that so many centuries ago the wild tribes of skiffs and sarmates, and later the cossaks (famous Ukrainian soldiers of 1400-1600s, that had long mustaches, long forelocks and wore wide red trousers), built their fortifications on Khortitsa Island. The city itself seemed to be still Soviet-like in its spirit and atmosphere, so it was interesting for me to take photos of their famous dam with the huge Lenin statue pointing at it, and the factories that were once the pride of the USSR and, amazingly, still successfully function for export purposes now.\n\nOur next stop was Crimea—a big heart-shaped peninsula that is washed by two seas: the Black Sea and the Azov Sea (the shallowest in the world, by the way). Crimea has indescribable mountains, fantastic crystal caves, and scenic, deep lakes. It is a picturesque place—so green, so virginal, so unlike anything I have seen before. The pictures I took in Crimea are the ones I consider to be the best in the series in my photo collection. We also attended a wine festival in Koktebel, where they make local wine, visited Askania Nova—a marvelous biosphere reserve sanctuary established in the nineteenth century—an opportunity to get a scope of what the country’s nature was like some twelve hundred years ago, still mostly underpopulated.\n\nThere was one thought that did not leave my mind even for a second during the whole time I spent in Ukraine: “I cannot believe that this country and its fantastic nature, history, and culture are so unknown to the rest of the world!” Ukraine was a true discovery for me, and one of those times when your expectations are nothing like what you see. I have visited this country two more times over the past three years, and every time my respect for Ukraine grows. If you should ask me what place I can recommend to those avid and blasé travelers who seem to have seen it all, I would say without a second of hesitation: “Go to Ukraine! Whatever you will expect, this will still amaze and astonish you!”###"}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between the Lapland and the village of Ramsjö?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " It could had been another drab winter. Every year, as soon as that particularly thick fog and white crisp snow covered the village of Ramsjö, its three hundred inhabitants would start spending their free time indoors, either sleeping or trying to wake up. This is what people commonly did in winter in Ramsjö—a small Swedish village located right in the middle of nowhere, on the shores of a beautiful lake that, unlike the inhabitants of Ramsjö, never froze even during the most severe winter seasons. Winter usually started early in this part of the country, and it meant that most life would hibernate almost completely for eight or nine months to come. The village folk were used to this kind of weather here. Everyone but Lara. She came to Ramsjö only three years ago, and she still had not forgotten what life was like outside this sleepy hollow den.\n\nLara came to Ramsjö to work at the local vineyard. She loved the work. She just was not into the whole Swedish moody, depressive climate and lifestyle. A native of Munich, Lara was used to having an active social life, a hundred and one acquaintances, and a wide variety of places to go out to in the evenings. Well, one facet of her life that she did not have problems with here was getting acquainted. It seemed that two months after Lara had arrived in the village, everyone already knew her, and some four months later, she already knew everyone here as well. “Everyone” was the three hundred and two inhabitants of Ramsjö, most of whom worked in the vineyards or the local forestry.\n\nLara’s first two winters in Ramsjö were scarily quiet and stress-free. It was not that she did not expect the place to be that way, but it seemed that she already had enough of the quietness and relaxation to start finding it rather depressive. She craved for sunny days, bright blue skies and smiley faces. That is why Lara long ago decided that this winter would be different from the previous two that she had spent here. Lara decided it would not hurt to travel around a little, the only problem being that she did not know what was there to see in wintry Sweden. But then it suddenly occurred to her that she was closer than ever to the fairy tale land that every child from anywhere in the world knows about—the Lapland. It was right there, a four-hour trip in her SUV and then another hour and a half on the local transport that looked like a combination of a caterpillar tractor and a land battleship. But, as frightening as it looked, it was the only way to travel around in the severe weather of the Scandinavian mountains.\n\nWhen Lara finally got to the heart of Finnish Korvatunturi—the residence of Santa Claus—she was already tired and sleepy. It was probably due to the Swedish lifestyle of being careful and deliberate, but as soon as she came closer to a small village house that looked like a postcard picture, three cute toddlers dressed in green and with miniature bells sewed to their cones approached her. Two of them took Lara by each side and the third one pointed at the house, speaking some esoteric language and talking in a shrill voice, half-laughing and half-whispering. That is just as much as it took for Lara to start feeling like she was part of a fairy tale. Being a clear-eyed 27-year-old woman, she suddenly felt like a gullible little girl who woke up in a fantasy land. Lara followed the toddlers inside the house, and suddenly felt so warm, so comfortable, and so… at home. The toddlers pointed at an old brown arm chair by the fireplace, and ran away, leaving the sounds of their contagious, joyful laughter ringing in Lara’s ears. She hopped on the arm chair, tucked her legs underneath herself and stretched her arms towards the warmth of the fire. She did not even notice when an old man with a big white beard, dressed in red, quietly approached her by the side and gently put his right arm on her shoulder like a father would have to a daughter after coming back from a prolonged winter excursion.\n\n“Well, hello there, dear. You have grown up so much since your last visit, my girl.”###"}
{"prompt": "What does Olivia think of the stranger she meets in the coffee-house?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Olivia knew that visiting Vienna would do more than provide charm: she came to the City of Music to boost her knowledge in the German language and to behold the sights of Austrian art set in opulent galleries. Studying Austrian history and literature had been a longtime passion of hers, and when an opportunity appeared that would enable her to travel there, she did not have to think about whether to go or not to go. Her parents granted her a month-long vacation to the country of her choice as a high school graduation present. Without an instant of hesitation, she said, “Austria,” with a softly assured tremor.\n\nShe studied the German language for three weeks at the Heinzberg International Academy of Languages, while viewing art galleries and museums in the evening. But after her period of study, she had one week to indulge in full days of sightseeing. Her first response to being free from the Academy that evening was to sit in a cozy coffee-house and read a daily “Heute,” or news journal. She had been trudging through the happenings around town, when the sound of a cafe entrance door opening caught her attention: a miniature bell jangling with a tinny resonance. An elegant young man stepped in. He appeared to be around 23-25 years old and was wearing a blue polo shirt and tidy navy pants with grey suede shoes. He had a typical Austrian look—blond straight hair, cut short on the sides, blue eyes, and high cheekbones. He almost seemed plastic in his perfection, except the eyebrow ring, which gave his overall sophisticated and intelligent look a sparkle of rebelliousness, which made him even more sublime.\n\nOlivia belonged to a family with a military tradition—her grandpa, her dad, and now her brother, all officers—so she had a conservative idea about the way a real man should look. And that image was not too different from the way the stranger presented himself—except of course for the pierced eyebrow. While she was examining him with obvious curiosity, Olivia did not even notice that his eyes were now chained to hers. She surfaced out of her half-dreaming state when she heard the stranger saying her name. First completely bewildered, Olivia realized she was still wearing the name-tag from her German-class.\n\nHe introduced himself as Mattias, a journalist who worked in the office of the paper Olivia was reading that moment. Sitting himself down at her table, they started talking and Olivia realized that three weeks in Austria was enough for her to start to conversing. They had much in common—a passion for classic literature, vintage rock music, abstract photography, and staying up late on summer nights. Though the evening drew in its darkness, she hardly noticed its fall. The night was comfortably warm—with a gentle, innocent smile, Mattias insisted that he should walk her to her hotel. While Olivia leisurely paced towards her destination with Mattias, she also began to smile in the same way.###"}
{"prompt": "How does the death of a best friend affect one's view of life?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In blistering Nebraska, it was America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I, went on a manly picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag and off I went to collect my friends by way of bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn.\n\nGeorge and I were born on the same day, March 14th, 1984. His father and my father were best friends from their days at King James High School. Their story is much like an old-fashioned novel or film about two lifelong best friends. They joined the U.S. Marines and both got married the same year. Intriguingly, they had their firstborns in the same year as well. As fate would have it, George and I became close friends. I did not have a sibling, and George became a sort of twin brother to me. We saw each other almost daily, involving ourselves in our selfsame talent: soccer. We both enjoyed defending against oncoming strikers—standing against the opposition with a tough tooth. Besides these similarities, George had a large heart and would go out of his way to help me in situations that called for aid.\n\nMost years, we held our Independence Day picnic by the Sequin River’s calm sound and sight. It was three quarters of a mile west of my apartment. As the three of us rode noisily past plain suburban houses on our bicycles, mostly due to the rickety nature of our mechanical companions, fireworks exploded loudly in the clear sky behind us.\n\nBy the river, we played soccer on the bumpy grass field, swam and caught a fish—a tiny and bony catfish. After having a late lunch of mixed berries, roasted chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, we sat down on the cushion-like grass surrounding the river and talked and laughed loudly at boyish jokes. Then out of the blue, George glared at me.\n\n“Promise we will always be best friends; that we will be exactly like our dads?” he earnestly pleaded with me. I cannot explain why, but a chill rushed down my spine. I had never seen George that serious before.\n\n“I promise,” I mumbled, barely audible.\n\nIt was almost dark and we had to blitz home so that our parents wouldn’t get worried. Terry’s residence was the nearest to the river. He shouted goodnight as he shot into the rubble-like parking lot of his residence. We continued down shadowy Harrison Street. Next was George to leave the group.\n\n“Remember your promise!” he shouted as we turned to enter his family’s compound down an opposing street.\n\nThose words haunt me to this day. Out of nowhere, a yellow Mustang rambled around the corner and headed straight for us.\n\n“George!” I cried out as I swerved to avoid the oncoming car.\n\nI heard the skidding of tires and a loud dinging sound. I was in a daze. People were screaming and running towards where the car had stopped. I had passed out. When I came to, I saw George’s mother holding a bloody, limp body, weeping hysterically. The reality of the situation hit me like a thunderbolt. Inexplicably, my legs became weak. The sky above started spinning wildly. I felt like a massive wind had lifted me up; I was swimming in the air. Then the wind ceased and I fell down with a thud. When I regained consciousness again, I was in my bed. Mum was sitting beside me, and I could see she had been crying.\n\n“Why him?” I asked her. She just cried, and I cried too.\n\nThe death of my best friend made me sullen, bitter, and inconsolable. How could God take him away so soon? There were so many unscrupulous people around, but God chose to take George. Life was never going to be the same again without him. A million friends could never replace him, or even one million angels, I thought. Then one evening, I was sitting with my mother after some tea, and I asked her, “Mum, does God love us? If He does, why does He hurt us?” With loving, teary eyes she peered into my eyes and said, “God loves us so much, son. He takes the righteous when they are still young, before the world can hurt them, and makes them angels.”\n\nI feel George next to me, following whichever path I choose. He was the most faithful of friends—he is my angel now.\n\n###"}
