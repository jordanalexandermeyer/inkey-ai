She dresses like she’s some exotic gypsy or something. Looks like a real high-maintenance kind of girl. Not my type; I’m not going to bother trying to get to know her.” So I didn’t. Too late, I realized what a mistake I’d made.\n\nMaria Mariella (she went by both names) was a foreign exchange student from Italy who was staying with a friend of mine, Joanne. Joanne and I weren’t that close, but we hung out in the same general crowd, so when the extended clique got together, Maria Mariella was often part of the group. We were friendly to each other, but we never tried to become friends until Shanda’s party.\n\nI wasn’t planning on going to Shanda’s party because I had a big track meet the next day, but my friend Elaine convinced me to go for a little while. When I was saying goodbye, Joanne rushed up to me.\n\n“Hey, Jenine, can you do me a really big favor? Maria Mariella needs to go home, but I want to stay. Would you mind dropping her off at my house?” I didn’t really want to, but it was on the way, and I would have looked like a real jerk if I said no, so I said, “Sure, no problem.” Maria Mariella was right behind Joanne. I looked at her and said, “Let’s go.”\n\nWe hopped into my car. As I was pulling out of the driveway, I popped in a 10,000 Maniacs cassette and turned the radio up loud.\n\n“I love this song!” Maria Mariella shouted over the music.\n\n“Really?” Not even my American friends appreciated this band. “You like the 10,000 Maniacs?”\n\n“I love them,” she said with her heavy Italian accent.\n\nAfter that, it seemed like Maria Mariella and I couldn’t stop talking to one another and finding things in common. I loved that she was straightforward and honest, like me. She shared my taste in music and film. We both had crushes on the same movie stars. It felt like a friendship that was meant to be.\n\nThen, just two weeks later, Maria Mariella threw a party at Joanne’s house. It was a going away party. Her mother had developed a serious illness, and Maria Mariella was going home to be with her. At that party, a group of us were playing Truth or Dare, one of our favorite games. It was Maria Mariella’s turn.\n\n“Truth!” she said. “Name something you regret,” our friend Denise demanded.\n\nMaria Mariella pointed a long finger at me. “I wish I’d taken the time to get to know you sooner. I didn’t think you were worth my time.”\n\nA sad smile came across my face. “I thought the same thing, Maria Mariella,” I said. “That is something I’m always going to regret.”###"}

When it happened I couldn’t believe it myself, but it’s true. This really happened.\n\nMy best friend and I were working one summer as line chefs in the Marriott at the sprawling TanTara Resort on the Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri. One Tuesday morning, as I walked through the kitchen to get to the time clock, half a dozen people said to me, “Uh-oh, man, the executive chef wants to see you.” The executive chef? But I hadn’t done anything wrong. What could he want? Why was I in trouble?\n\nI clocked in and knocked on the executive chef’s door. “Listen,” he said angrily when I sat down, “I don’t know what you guys did or how you did it, but you and your buddy Jim have off on Friday.” Friday was our busiest night; no one gets off on Friday without a very good reason. “Just one thing,” he said sternly as I got up to go, “Don’t you guys tell anyone why you’re not coming in. Understand?”\n\n“Understand,” I replied, but I had no idea what he was talking about. I had to find Jim as soon as possible and figure out what was going on. But every time I asked Jim about it, he simply said, “I’ll tell you later. Just don’t worry about it.” No matter how much I begged, he wouldn’t tell me what was going on and why we had the day off. By Thursday night, he still hadn’t told me what was happening Friday. As we were watching TV in our apartment, he said, “Let’s hit the sack early tonight. We’re going to need lots of rest for tomorrow.” Jim never went to bed early. What on earth was going on?\n\nIn the morning, Jim woke me up (another anomaly) and told me to get a quick shower, put on my bathing suit, and pack a change of clothes. A few minutes later, a dark SUV with tinted windows pulled up in front of our building. “There’s our ride,” Jim said with a secretive smile. We walked out to the car, but I wasn’t getting in without an explanation. So Jim shoved me in. Inside, I looked up, and there in the passenger seat was Hugh Jackman.\n\nNow Jim had no choice but to explain. It turns out that a friend of a friend of Jim’s knew Hugh Jackman and knew that Hugh wanted to get away for a totally private vacation between films. This friend said that he knew two guys at a large secluded lake in Missouri who would “take care of him.” So ____ called the executive chef and asked for me and Jim to have the day off.\n\nWe spent the day out on the lake with Hugh, water-skiing, fishing, eating, drinking, and telling stories. We did our best to treat him like just another guy spending the day with a couple of new friends. We didn’t ask him anything about Hollywood or his latest high-profile romance; we just let him relax and be himself for a day without cameras or fans.\n\nAt the end of the day, as we pulled back into the dock, he said, “Listen, guys, I had a really good time today. It was just what I needed. I appreciate it, man.” He shook our hands. “One favor, though?” he asked. “Don’t tell anybody about this. If people find out I’m here, I won’t get any peace and quiet. I need some time alone.”\n\n“No problem,” we said, and headed home. The next day, everyone kept asking what was so special that we had to have Friday off. The night was a disaster for the kitchen, and they were all upset that we hadn’t been there. All we could say was, “Nothing, man, nothing. We were just hanging out.” We had a great time, too, and we kept our promise.###"}

Mr. Robinson was a notorious crank, the house was always dark and creepy, and his dog was a terror—a mean, fang-toothed creature that looked like she would love to tear you apart.\n\nThe dog’s name was Angel, but she scared the devil out of us. She was half pit bull, half Doberman pinscher. Mr. Robinson kept her out on the front lawn, chained to a thin pole stuck in the ground near his front door. It was a long chain, and when I walked past the house to the bus stop, Angel always bounded toward me, barking furiously. One of these times that chain will break, I thought, and I’ll be Angel’s dinner. When I got to the Robinson house, I always walked past it as quickly as I could. Sometimes I could see Mr. Robinson watching from the window, laughing.\n\nThen it happened. We had gotten our report cards in school that day, and I was so proud of my marks and my teachers’ comments that I just had to look at them again on my way home from the bus stop. I was so wrapped up in that report card that I didn’t realize how close I was to Mr. Robinson’s house, and Angel startled me when she started barking. I dropped my report card, and just then, a big gust of wind took the paper up into the air. It landed right smack in the middle of Mr. Robinson’s lawn, about two feet away from Angel.\n\nAngel, growling ferociously, was straining her chain, trying to get closer to me. I could see her long canines. I could even smell her from where I was standing. I think I was shaking. But I needed to get that report card back. My mom had to sign it. Besides, she had to see those fantastic grades.\n\nI thought about yelling for Mr. Robinson, but I was just as afraid of him as of the dog. So I decided to see if maybe, just maybe, Angel would let me get close enough to get that piece of paper.\n\nI remembered my uncle telling me that dogs can sense your fear, and that most dogs will be friendly if you approach them in the right manner. So I did my best not to look scared. I straightened up, softened my face, and walked slowly toward Angel. She kept barking and growling. Saliva was dripping from her chin. I closed my eyes and gulped. I was about six feet away from Angel, and I put my fist out in front of me for her to smell, saying, “Here, girl. Nice girl. Good girl,” as calmly as I could. But she was barking so loudly and angrily that I’m sure she didn’t hear a word.\n\nInside, I had never been more frightened. This dog is going to tear me to pieces, I thought. But I kept going, slowly. I had never earned such good marks before. I wasn’t going to let a crazy old dog keep me from showing that report card to my parents.\n\nI was about three steps away from Angel when the wind blew again, this time sending my report card just out of Angel’s reach. I didn’t have to confront that dog after all. It was a good thing, too—Mr. Robinson later told my folks that Angel surely would have bitten me badly. I realized that what I’d planned to do was dangerous and that I was simply being stubborn. But part of me was proud, because I was brave enough to try to get close to Angel.###"}

My dad had just accepted a promotion that required a transfer, and we moved from Chicago to Oakland, California, just a few days before I was to begin the sixth grade. I didn’t even have a chance to get to know any of the kids in the neighborhood.\n\nAfter the first day of school, I could tell that Charlie Jenkins was the one who would make me or break me. He was a bully for sure, but he was so good-looking and charming that everyone seemed to like him. He was clearly the center of power in that classroom, and I knew I would have to win his approval. I just wasn’t sure what I’d have to do to get it.\n\nMy answer came at the end of the third week of school, when Ms. Harcourt gave us our second writing assignment. We’d been reading and discussing fables, and now it was our turn to write our own. That afternoon, Charlie cornered me on the playground.\n\nHe teased me about being a new kid, yet he seemed interested in the fact that I was a good writer. Our teacher, Ms. Harcourt had read aloud one of my poems in class just yesterday, and obviously he was paying attention. I admitted that I had a flair for writing, and at first I was flattered that he noticed. But, he had an ulterior motive.\n\n“Hey, new kid, hold on a second,” he said, standing between the gate and me. “You seem to be pretty good with writing.”\n\n“Yeah, you do alright, alright,” he replied. “I’ll tell you what,” he said, moving closer, until his face was just a few inches from mine. “Why don’t you just write an extra fable, one for you, one for me? Let me see what you can do.”\n\nSo that was it. I was going to do Charlie’s English homework for him. That was the price I was going to pay to be accepted.\n\nCharlie didn’t wait for an answer. “Bring two fables to school on Monday,” he said. That would give him time to copy it over into his own handwriting to submit to Ms. Harcourt on Tuesday.\n\nOver the weekend, I wrote two fables, both of them quite good, I thought, but one was definitely better than the other. On Monday morning, I met Charlie in the schoolyard as planned.\n\n“Here’s your fable,” I said to Charlie, handing him a piece of paper. I gave Charlie the fable that I thought was inferior, keeping the better fable for myself, and turned to walk away.\n\nHe questioned me about the quality of the paper, read it quickly, and decided that it passed muster. Without saying thank you or goodbye, he swaggered off into the building.\n\nA few days later, Ms. Harcourt returned our fables. I looked at my paper, expecting to see an A or A+, but my grade was an A-. Then I looked over at Charlie. He was holding his paper up high so I could see his grade: A+. I knew the fable I’d kept for myself was better. Perhaps Charlie’s charm was factored into his grade.\n\nFortunately, I only had to do one more assignment for Charlie before he and his family abruptly moved to another town. Now Charlie was going to be the new kid in the classroom. I often wondered what he had to do there to be accepted.###"}

I was pretty coordinated myself, but because I was so insecure, I never seemed to be any good at sports. I was so afraid of missing the ball that I would be sure to swing and miss, even if it was right over the plate. But Katie was my best friend, and if she joined a team, I did, too. Or at least I tried. Katie was a starter for the junior varsity field hockey team; I sat on the bench all season. Katie played regularly in JV basketball; I was cut during tryouts. I figured I was headed for a similar fate with lacrosse. But Katie was my best friend, so I signed up anyway.\n\nKatie was a natural, and she picked up the new sport quickly. I, on the other hand, couldn’t seem to hold the lacrosse stick comfortably. I caught one out of ten throws, if I was lucky, and my tosses were always way off their mark. I was clumsy and feeling clumsier, and I thought maybe it was time to give it up. But that would create an even wider gulf between Katie and me. Already she was spending more and more time with the girls who, like her, excelled at sports. I was beginning to be left behind.\n\nDetermined to stick it out and save our friendship, I begged my mom to take me to a sporting goods store and buy me an early birthday present: my own lacrosse stick and ball so I could practice at home. Katie was impressed with my stick, but I could tell that she thought it was a waste of money. She figured I would never get to use that stick in a game.\n\nI was hurt by her reaction, and again I felt the distance between us. If I was going to keep Katie as a friend, I thought, I simply had to get the hang of this sport. It was my last chance. Somehow, someway, I had to learn how to throw and catch the ball in that net and be respectable on the playing field.\n\nSo I practiced, and I practiced, and I practiced some more. I often felt like there was no hope, and I broke two windows in the garage, but I kept at it.\n\nThen, one day, just after the first official game of the season (during which I sat on the bench), something happened. I paired off with Suzie, who had become my partner since Katie had quickly proven to be too good to play with me. That day, when Suzi sent me her first throw, I caught it. When I threw the ball back to her, I hit her stick dead on. I caught her next throw, and the next. Something was happening. I was getting it. The stick was actually feeling good in my hands. The movements were becoming natural. I was catching and throwing the ball accurately.\n\nI still don’t know what exactly happened that day, but I will always be grateful for it. By the end of the season, I was starting for the JV team. I scored 12 goals that year, and the next year I was playing varsity. My success on the field gave me confidence that I desperately needed. Katie and I continued to drift apart, but Suzie turned out to be a great friend. She quit after the first year, but she came to every game to cheer me on.###"}

There were a few things I knew: He’d come over from Hungary in 1956, after the Revolution. He’d fought with the rebels in Budapest. He was a toolmaker in Hungary, and he was a toolmaker here. He left behind his parents and 11 brothers and sisters, who still lived in the countryside. They exchanged letters once or twice a year. That was about all I knew.\n\nThe summer that I was fourteen, my dad received one of those letters. In it was the news that one of his brothers had died. Maybe it was the realization that he was so out of touch with his family. Maybe it was his own mortality he was facing. In any case, a few days after the letter came, he told me about his role in the Hungarian Revolution and his escape from Hungary.\n\nThe Hungarian Revolution began with a massive student protest on October 23, 1956, and ended just a few weeks later in November after the city was invaded by Soviet tanks and the rebellion crushed. My dad, just 22 years old, had decided to join the students who were protesting the Communist regime, and soon he was not just a protester but a soldier, and not just a soldier but an officer in the rebel army. “Wait a minute,” he said, and he returned with a tattered copy of LIFE magazine’s special issue devoted to the Hungarian Revolution. He flipped through the pages, showing me image after image of buildings demolished by bombs, rebels fighting on foot against tanks, bodies lying in the street. Then he found the picture he was looking for. “There,” he said, pointing to a window in an abandoned, bullet-ridden building. “I was hiding in there, throwing Malotov cocktails at the Russian tanks.”\n\nIt’s a long and fascinating story, and I wanted to know all the details. How did he get involved? How did he escape? How close was he to being captured or killed? I had so many questions. But the question I wanted answered most was this: Why did he fight? At that age, I was just starting to find my footing in the swampy ground of ethics and moral stances. I was having a tough time figuring out what I believed in, and I wanted desperately to understand how someone could believe in something so strongly that he would be willing to die for it.\n\nWhy did he do it? There were a lot of reasons, he said. For one thing, the Communist regime was ruining the economy. As a toolmaker with several years of experience, he had a better salary than most, but still, he said, “I couldn’t afford both clothes and food.” If he respected the government, he would have been able to live with that. “But what I couldn’t live with,” he said, “was not being able to say what I wanted. The Communists, they had all kinds of restrictions on everything. You couldn’t go to the next town without the proper permissions and papers. And you couldn’t say anything, not anything, against the government, or else they’d put you in jail, or worse. They’d come and get you late at night and no one in your family would ever see you again.” That’s what happened to his best friend, Attila. He disappeared the night of September 22, and no one ever heard from him again.\n\nMy dad often complains about America. The politicians are crooks, criminals have too many rights, schools and parents aren’t strict enough with children, and the taxes are “an abomination.” But I don’t need to remind him that at least in this country, he can complain as loudly as he pleases.###"}

Edie and her older sister used to babysit my sister and me. It wouldn’t be so unlikely for her to pick up a family secret or two.\n\nKeith’s mom had told him what Edie told her because she believed it was proof that I wasn’t good enough to be his girlfriend.

I knew right away what I was going to make: my Aunt Rosie’s famous chocolate cake.\n\nMy aunt Rosie made the best chocolate cake in the world. It was a recipe she had gotten from her grandmother, who swore her grandmother had personally made that chocolate cake for the Prince of Wales. When I started the cooking class, I had asked Aunt Rosie what made her chocolate cake so special. She told me the secret ingredient was coffee.\n\nI had never tried to bake a cake from scratch before, and since the chocolate cake was Aunt Rosie’s specialty, I thought for sure she would help me make it.\n\n“But that would be cheating,” she said as a she handed me the recipe. “You go home and you make it yourself. Make sure you save a piece for me!” she hollered as I headed out the door.\n\nAt home, I got out my ingredients: eggs, butter, milk, sugar, fine powdered chocolate, cinnamon, baking powder, and coffee. The recipe looked easy enough, and I followed each step carefully. When I had mixed everything together, I carefully poured the batter into the pan. I put the cake into the oven, which I had preheated as directed, and set a timer for 50 minutes. When the buzzer went off, I stuck a toothpick into the middle of the cake to make sure it was done. It was perfect.\n\nWhen the cake cooled, I opened up a can of Betty Crocker’s chocolate frosting, spread a thick layer on top of the cake, and covered it with plastic wrap. It was a masterpiece, and I couldn’t wait for my classmates to taste it.\n\nThe next morning, I carried my cake carefully to school. I passed out pieces to my classmates, beaming with pride. But when I saw the look on their faces, I knew something was terribly wrong. I took a bite and nearly burst into tears. No wonder they looked disgusted! Aunt Rosie’s cake was never crunchy, and the crunchy things were bitter. The cake tasted awful. My heart sank as I watched Mrs. Wilson take a bite. She crunched, paused, crunched again, paused again, and looked at me thoughtfully.\n\n“Sarah,” she said gently, “does the recipe for this cake call for coffee?”\n\n“Yes,” I replied.\n\n“Hmmm. I thought so.”\n\nWhen I questioned her about my mistake, she said, “You used coffee grounds. You were supposed to use liquid coffee,” she said, and she laughed gently.\n\nI was mortified.

But instead of hearing the crunch of metal crashing into metal, I heard the screeching of brakes as the truck swerved around me, just in time to avoid a head-on collision. The truck skidded to a stop on the shoulder about a hundred feet away from me. Then the driver jumped out and ran over to see if I was okay.\n\nThat night at home, I eased my aching body into bed. But I was climbing into my own bed, in my own room, not in the hospital. Somehow, the only injuries I sustained were a few cuts on my face and hands, a bruised right shoulder, and two bruised calf muscles. My new car was totaled, but I didn’t care. All that mattered was that I was alive.###"}
{"prompt": "Describe an experience you had that would be considered a near miss or a brush with disaster.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I must have had a guardian angel that day.\n\nI was six and had just learned how to ride a bicycle. My bike was a beauty: pink all over, with a stylish banana seat, iridescent fringes hanging off the handle bars, and a white woven basket with big, pink flowers on the front.\n\nIt was a Monday afternoon and I was alone, riding my bike in circles in the driveway. I was exalting in my freedom: no more training wheels, no more big brother or father pushing me from behind and holding me steady. Now I could start, stop, and ride all by myself, and I went around and around our circular driveway in complete bliss.\n\nThe sun shone on my face and made the black pavement hot, even though it was already late September. Emboldened by the warmth of the sun and the excitement of my success—eight laps around and I hadn’t fallen yet—I decided it was time to leave the safety of the circle and ride down the steep hill that led to the road on which we lived: Route 309, a four-lane, heavily-traveled highway. I warmed up with another two or three turns around the circle and then eased to my right and down the slope.\n\nFrom the start of the circle to the edge of the highway, the driveway ran about 200 feet at an even 45 degrees. I began to pick up a lot of speed at 50 feet, more at 75, and by 100 feet I was flying. The road was getting closer; I could see the faces of the people driving by at 50, 60, 70 miles an hour. It was time to slow down, but I couldn’t. I kept going faster, and faster, and I couldn’t stop. In my panic, I forgot how to use the brakes.\n\nIn an instant I was out on the highway, a little pink streak that zoomed across all four lanes and somehow, someway, ended up on the other side, up on the Zeigler’s lawn, in one piece. In the seconds that it took me to cross the road, there had not been a single car. An instant later, they were back, and I had to wait several minutes before I slowly, shakily, walked my bike back across the street and up the driveway.\n\nI never told anyone about what happened, and it was a long, long time before I ventured down that slope again. When I did, I used my brakes the whole way down. This time, I wasn’t going to forget.###"}
{"prompt": "We all need help from others from time to time. Tell about a time you helped someone in need.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " It was the hottest day of the summer, a record-breaking 102 degrees, hot and humid, sweltering even in the shade. I was driving back from visiting my older brother and his new baby. In the blistering heat, I could see the blacktop bubbling. I’d never been so grateful for air conditioning before.\n\nI cruised happily along County Route 2, which wound through the northern tip of the Sonoran Desert. Then I saw that a car had broken down up ahead. It was the first car I’d seen in about half an hour. In the distance, a few hundred feet ahead of the car, I saw a stooped figure walking with a gas can in his hands. There was nothing around for miles. There was no way this person was going to make it to the nearest town, which was a good twenty miles away, in this desert heat.\n\nI’d always been told to stay away from strangers, but I thought if there ever was a time to do a good deed, this was it. Besides, as I neared the figure, I could tell that it was an elderly man, and I thought there was little chance he’d do me any harm. So I slowed down and pulled over. “Need a lift?” I asked.\n\nNow that I could see him clearly, it was obvious the old man was already in trouble. He’d only walked a hundred yards or so, and he looked as if he was going to pass out any moment. “I’d be most grateful, young lady, if you could help me get to a gas station,” he said slowly. “I seem to be out of petroleum.”\n\n“No problem,” I replied. “I’m headed that way.”\n\nHe climbed slowly into the car and I pulled back out onto the road. “Not a good day for car trouble, huh?” I asked.\n\n“Indeed,” he replied. He was silent for a few minutes while his body temperature normalized. I offered him a soda from the cooler I’d packed for my four-hour ride. He accepted it gratefully. We made a little small talk then, but just a little. He seemed to prefer the silence.\n\nAs we neared the gas station, I asked him if he would like a ride back to his car. “I don’t have to be home until late this afternoon,” I told him. “It’s no trouble.”\n\n“I know it is quite out of your way,” he replied. “I would be most grateful.” He paused. “And just where is home, young lady?”\n\n“Elmwood,” I replied. I introduced myself as Emily Hampton and found out that he was Edward Gilliam. “By the way, my name is Emily. Emily Hampton.”\n\n“You’re a very kind lady, Ms. Hampton. My name is Edward Gilliam.” Edward filled up his gas can and I drove him back to his car. We filled up his tank, and I followed him back into town just to make sure he was ok. At the gas station, I beeped and waved and continued north towards home. Edward waved and nodded his thanks.\n\nThe next morning, the doorbell rang. My mom answered. “Emily!” she hollered. “Get down here!” I came down the stairs and saw a giant bouquet of flowers. They were stunning. A small note was attached:\n\n“Dearest Emily, thank you for your incredible kindness yesterday. You just might have saved my life, and I am eternally grateful. You reminded an old man of how much beauty there is in this world. Yours, Edward Gilliam.”###"}
