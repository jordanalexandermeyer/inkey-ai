{"prompt": "What are the best mobile photo processing tools?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Living in an age when graphics are gradually overwhelming textual information implies certain changes to people’s psychology (for example, a dramatic decrease in attention spans—especially among the youth), lifestyles, and hobbies. Speaking of the latter, it can be said that more and more people each year fall in love with mobile photography. Unlike “traditional” photography, which requires a person to possess certain knowledge about cameras, lightning, optics, and so on, mobile photography is more intuitive, easy to learn, and thus more available for the majority of people—especially considering that nowadays almost everyone has a smartphone, which is much easier to carry around than a bulky DSLR camera. In this regard, image processing on mobile platforms is extremely popular—starting with Instagram with its built-in presets and settings, applications designed for working with images have become so numerous that it can sometimes be difficult to figure out which one is worth using. However, experienced mobile photographers distinguish several most effective applications used most often either alone or combined with each other. Among these applications are Snapseed, VSCOcam, and Lightroom.\n\nLightroom was designed by Adobe—a giant in the field of designer software solutions; Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, AfterEffects, and other programs widely used by designers all over the world were invented by Adobe. Respectively, it would be logical to anticipate that the mobile version of one of Adobe’s most famous programs (Lightroom is also available for desktop computers) would be as brilliant as its other products. And it is—in a way. Mobile Lightroom is, generally speaking, a collection of photo filters, which can be easily applied to a batch of photos simultaneously; it is extremely useful if a photographer needs to quickly process a number of photos in the same style, for example—using the same color schemes, contrast, light and shade solutions. It is also useful if you need to synchronize your work between different platforms—employing Adobe’s Creative Cloud, you can easily access it wherever you are. It is useful if you suddenly get an idea about how you could process a number of photos you have taken recently, but your computer is not at hand: in this case, you can do the initial processing in mobile Lightroom, and then synchronize with your desktop and finish the work at home, where more of the tools are available. At the same time, mobile Lightroom lacks a number of functions VSCOcam and Snapseed provide.\n\nVSCOcam has many presets as well, either built-in or purchased (the application itself is free). It allows a bit more of control over the image adjustment process than Lightroom, but its main value is still in the pre-made filters; even used alone, without any other processing, these filters can make any image look stylish, moody, and conceptual. The library of filters that can be purchased (for a rather affordable price), is regularly updated, and all of the filters in it are sorted under categories; you can find filters perfectly suited for architecture, portrait, landscape, still life, macro, and other occasions. VSCOcam is somewhat similar to Instagram—it works best if you first apply a filter to an image, and then trim it with fine settings. The application also incorporates a minimalistic social network, allowing users to showcase their work; unlike Instagram, finding bad or boring images on VSCO Grid is difficult. Overall, it is a convenient application with a satisfying level of control over image processing, but lacking several crucial features to serve as a truly universal and powerful tool for a photographer. In addition, although its design is extremely polished, stylish, and minimalistic, some icons are not intuitive, and some people could find the interface somewhat bulky.\n\nAnd finally, Snapseed by Google is one of the best mobile photo processing tools. Its possibilities and potential are amazing, especially compared to a number of other similar applications. Of course, it does not provide the same functionality as desktop Photoshop, but for a smartphone application, Snapseed does more than just good. Brushes, spot correction, white balance, curves, a whole arsenal of color correcting sliders, patches, text tool (and a powerful one)—all this is more than just basic functionality provided by many of Snapseed’s competitors. This is not to mention various presets—although they are not as sophisticated as in VSCOcam, they can still provide a number of interesting visual solutions. All tools fall under categories, and the navigation is rather sophisticated: a vertical slide selects tools in the chosen category, while a horizontal slide adjusts a tool’s parameters. Once again, not as stylish and fancy as VSCOcam, Snapseed’s interface might look somewhat outdated—but it is fully compensated with the amazing functions it grants its users with.\n\nIt is rather difficult to choose the best application among the three evaluated above—and perhaps unnecessary. Each of these applications serves its own purpose, and is probably the best in its own field. For instance, VSCOcam is perfect for quick editing, being able to turn a photo into a masterpiece in no time. Snapseed is for those who enjoy thorough editing and prefer to have full control over processing; it requires a user to spend a lot of time on it, but the result can be astonishing. Lightroom, it its turn, is great for quickly outlining the course of further editing, for processing multiple photos at once, and for accessing all of them wherever a user is, using Adobe’s Creative Cloud. The best results can be probably achieved through combining all of the three applications.###"}
{"prompt": "How should one evaluate pieces of modern art?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Visual art as we know it today is completely different from what had been created before the 20th century. Realistic depictions of the surrounding reality has given up its place in favor of attempts to convey the artist’s inner world directly through the diversity of shapes, colors, and means of visual depiction. Hence, a reasonable question arises: how should one evaluate pieces of modern art given that traditional criteria of assessment do not apply easily in this case? Unlike traditional art, where one can make judgments about the scene, an artist’s skills, and composition, modern art should be evaluated in a slightly different manner.\n\nEven though there are numerous artistic laws and rules, any assessment made about a piece of art remains subjective; I believe one can easily explain why someone likes a particular piece of art, but will not be able to persuade those who disagree with them or have no artistic taste. Considering this, let us refer to “Scream”—a famous painting by Edward Munch. Though it was painted more than 110 years ago, it still makes a perfect example of modern art. Personally, I usually evaluate paintings by their lucidity, strength of artistic means (such as composition, coloring, and so on), and the creator’s ability to communicate with the audience through a canvas.\n\nDespite its expressionistic, distorted shapes and disturbing colors (which will be discussed later) “Scream” is still a realistic painting, performed in an expressionist manner. Its scene contains no abstract symbols or figures; its elements are clearly visible and do not require interpreting, which proves that the painting is realistic. Hence, in terms of comprehension, Munch’s “Scream” can be relatively easily perceived by all people, and thus is open for reasoned debates about its artistic value. It is good for any piece of art, as people should be able to discuss what they perceive; for example, in the case of “The Black Square” by Malevich (which is also a significant and symbolic painting) it is much more difficult for people to understand the artistic value of what they are shown (RealArtsHistory).\n\nBy his painting, Munch completely fulfilled the idea of expressionism: conveying the feelings through the canvas. Compositional means used by the artist create a feeling that a figure in the center is pierced and oppressed by the surrounding nature, and at the same time, the scenery looks unstable; intersecting diagonal lines of the bridge and the river, as well as the impending skies, create tension; right in its center, a figure screaming in horror looks crushed by the power of nature and uncertainty; even despite that the figure is not alone (the two people standing nearby) the painting is soaked with the feeling of despair and loneliness: due to the use of a slightly distorted perspective, Munch created an unbridgeable distance between the central figure and people who witness this artwork. These impressions are powered by disturbing colors used by the artist, and curvy lines that make the scene look like a delusion. The picture definitely affects anybody who looks at it.\n\n“Scream” was created in a manner that was typical for Edward Munch, though some features in this painting were exaggerated. Thin dark figures with sunken eyes, disturbing dim colors, the sensation of loneliness, generalized scenery—these were Munch’s regular artistic techniques, and all of them were embodied in “Scream.” Thus, this painting can be called a complete embodiment of Munch’s creative method; this method, however, was inspired by Munch’s severe psychological disorders. The artist suffered from manic-depressive psychosis, and his paintings are a testament to his psychological condition and show people how deep his sufferings were (AllBios).\n\n“Scream” by Edward Munch is a perfect example of modern art. Though it had been painted almost a century ago, it still remains modern, both because of the universal character of existential problems raised by it, and by the artistic means used. Munch created an emotionally influential, powerful piece of art; the artistic means he used completely convey the feelings of despair and loneliness, and all of Munch’s tragic personality seems to be expressed in this painting.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the positive and negative aspects of feminism?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Today, we take many socio-political phenomenons for granted. People in democratic countries vote for their candidates during presidential elections, freely express themselves, practice any religion they want, and enjoy many other rights and freedoms, all of which are guarded by numerous laws, bills, non-governmental organizations, and so on. However, the realities of social life were not always so fair. About a hundred years ago, white and black people treated each other with lawful distrust, women were not considered equal with men to a large extent, and many other injustices took place.\n\nOne of the most significant social movements in history is feminism. Germinated in Great Britain at the end of 18th century in the form of calls to grant women the right to vote in elections, it became a movement in the 19th century, and gradually turned into a powerful political force. Feminism has set numerous goals for itself, and has affected many spheres of our everyday life, though some of its achievements can be called controversial.\n\nFeminists can be proud of the changes they caused in the socio-political sphere; this refers to their active participation in political life, and also to the causes for equal opportunities, attitudes, and other rights. In particular, the 19th Amendment, ratified in 1920, claimed that a U.S. citizen cannot be denied from the right to vote on the basis of sex; besides, the Equal Rights Amendment, first introduced in 1923, claims that the equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex (ERA). However, the ERA still has not been introduced into the U.S. Constitution—therefore feminists continue to struggle with this issue. In addition, even though women’s rights and equality have been guaranteed by a number of legislative documents, at the household level, women are sometimes still treated with prejudice—even by women themselves.\n\nFeminists have also made mass culture take a closer look at less obvious phenomena and problems that usually remained hidden. Thus, in the 1970s, researcher Sheila Rowbotham introduced her study Hidden from History, in which she analyzed issues concerning employment and relationships in the workplace; women trade unionism and organizations; family roles; sexuality and differences in attitude towards males and females in terms of sexual activity; and other important problems (Making History). Due to studies like this one, the modern world is aware of such issues as workplace discrimination on the basis of sex; sexual harassment (which had been hushed up for a long time) in public places or at home; an imposition of certain social roles of women; and other significant issues, which due to such attention from feminist organizations, can now be regulated and solved.\n\nOn the other hand, feminism sometimes seems to be fighting windmills, because along with objectively important problems, it tries to find complexes where there are little or none. For an ideal example, one needs to look no further than debates around the word “history”; in the 1960s, feminists who criticized the conventional historiography claimed that the word “history” limited one’s vision of historical events only by the male perspective; this claim was made because feminists interpreted the word “history” as a contraction for “his story”—an interpretation of events told on behalf of a male individual. In fact, this word comes from the Ancient Greek language; it was pronounced as “historia,” and meaning knowledge obtained by inquiry (Etymonline.com). Surprisingly, this odd interpretation causes debates even today, along with such problems as whether compliments about appearance insults a women’s dignity; women-versus-men competitions; sexist language, and other controversial issues.\n\nConsidering all this, feminism should be seen as a movement that has a role and value for the real world that is extremely difficult to underestimate. Feminists won the voting rights for women, and stand on guard for equality and fair relationships between genders. Though not all problems in this field are solved, feminist organizations continue their work. Feminists made American society recognize and admit the existence of multiple hushed-up problems, such as workplace discrimination on the basis of sex, or sexual harassment. At the same time, feminists tend to distract on issues of minor significance, such as, for instance, the etymology of certain words and language sexism. Still, even despite such distractions, feminism plays an important role in modern American society.###"}
{"prompt": "How does political correctness limit communication and why is it inefficient?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In 1948, a renowned British journalist, George Orwell, wrote his famous novel 1984, in which he described a totalitarian society where people had no freedom to express their thoughts without fear. In this novel, the government, in order to limit citizens’ capacity of thinking about censored topics, invented a new language, Newspeak, which widely used euphemisms for omitting prohibited words. In Newspeak, many words were simply excluded, because if there was no word to determine a crime, then the crime itself could not be committed. This strongly correlates to the modern phenomena of political correctness, which has a similar approach and ethical value.\n\nThe concept of political correctness seems ridiculous and ineffective due to the aggregate of several factors. The first of them is that expressions meant to omit an “uncomfortable” topic still directly point at it. For example, if you call a blind individual “a person with sight disorders” it will still point to their blindness, and possess the same meaning – the inability to see. By calling someone “African American” when they are not from Africa, you are trying not to say “black,” thus giving off the impression that you feel the word “black” is an insulting word worth avoiding, which in turn makes it insulting because you appear like you think it is (GeekoSystem). Thus, by this criteria, political correctness fails to prove its efficiency.\n\nThe inefficiency of political correctness becomes even more obvious when it comes to words and phrases which are assessed as potentially insulting. In 2012, the New York City Department of Education published a list of 50 words that can be considered insulting (CBS New York). It is not clear how such words and expressions as, for instance, dinosaur, birthday, divorce, computers in the home, homes with swimming pools, politics, religion, or television and video games can offend other people. If authorities think the word “divorce” insults a child whose parents had separated, than they should consider that the word “marriage” can be insulting for these children as well. According to this logic, too many potentially insulting phrases must be prohibited from use, which is far from rational.\n\nPolitically correct language limits communication and impoverishes language, as it is not natural. People constantly have to mind what they say in fear of getting sued or physically harmed, which leads to increasing stress. In its turn, stress causes people to become less aware and more irritated, which can result in an already calculated insult. People are responsible only for their own words and reactions; to some extent, we must be aware of what we say to others, but we must not predict and guess the reactions of our interlocutors to the words we use all the time. Therefore, it is natural when people use direct words instead of “politically correct” substitutes. One can never truly know when they insult another person; it is impossible to be nice and pleasant to everyone in respect to the words we employ; thus, trying to comfort everyone by intentionally substituting necessary and habitual words is a wasted labor.\n\nPolitical correctness is an artificial concept of omitting potentially abusing words to comfort people who potentially could get insulted by them. In reality, the practice of political correctness does not prove itself to be efficient due to several factors. Politically correct words and phrases still describe the terms which are being omitted; besides, the fact of using politically correct formulations marks neutral concepts as such, which can be offending. For political correctness to achieve its goals, too many words have to be banned. Also, politically correct language is not natural for most individuals; it causes stress and irritation, and burdens people with the responsibility for the reactions and feelings of the people they communicate with.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the most important factors to consider when evaluating the film \"The Shining\"?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " One of the most ambiguous movies shot by Stanley Kubrick is “The Shining”—a horror film, that tells a story of a family that has moved into a hotel called the Overlook, which was inhabited by ghosts. Throughout the film, the plot develops around the Torrance family: Jack, Wendy, and their son Danny. Kubrick based the film on a novel written by Steven King of the same name. The literary source is rather thrilling and intriguing, and the film can basically be given the same positive assessment.\n\nAccording to the screenplay, Jack Torrance, a writer who had quit abusing alcohol, moves into a distant hotel in the mountains with his family. The winter weather conditions render the hotel fully isolated from the outer world. All roads leading to it are covered with snow, so no vehicles can pass. During this period, the hotel is closed. Isolation, however, is what Jack needs to write his new novel, and at the same time, he will work as the hotel’s keeper. The hotel was built on a patch of land where an old Indian cemetery was located. During the film, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicolson), influenced by the evil spirits, gradually goes insane and attempts to kill his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd), but fails to do so and dies.\n\nThe first and foremost criterion to evaluate “The Shining” is the atmosphere that was reproduced in the film. Kubrick managed to convey a sense of isolation and detachment, as well as the supernatural fear constantly increasing throughout the film. Despite the luxurious furnishing, the Overlook hotel looks like a cemetery. The tension is also delivered through scenes with ghosts and the depictions of how Jack gradually loses his mind. One of the most horrifying moments in the film is when Wendy takes a look at the manuscript Jack had been writing during the period of time their family spent in the hotel. She sees that all pages are scribbled with just one phrase: “All fun and no play makes Jack a dull boy,” and she then understands that her husband is completely insane. The sense of fear and desperation, which Kubrick intended to convey to the audience, is delivered masterfully, thus speaking in the film’s favor.\n\nThen, speaking of the acting, with the exception of Jack Nicholson and Scatman Crothers, it is unfortunately unconvincing. While Jack Nicholson managed to create an image of a psychotic writer suffering from alcoholism, the other two members of the Torrance family, played by Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd, look stilted and simulated. In the case of Danny Lloyd, allowances can be made for him because of his age and lack of acting experience; however, Shelley Duvall in this particular movie is not at her best. In most action scenes, her play looks factitious, and sometimes inappropriate, which is irritating. This makes significant contrast to Nicholson’s character who is persuasive, such as in the scene when he breaks the bathroom door with a fire ax. This is, perhaps, one of the best scenes in the film.\n\nThe technical performance is also important for the film’s evaluation, and “The Shining” can be noted for a high level of cinematography. The film introduces a number of novelties that were never used before, or were used rarely. Almost all stills with Danny were shot from the growth rate of a small boy. This technique helps the audience feel the world of a child in a more realistic manner, and view the ghosts and the surrounding scary environment through his eyes. Also, during the filming, a Steadycam system was used. This technology allows for the stabilization of the picture in dynamic scenes. For example, the scene when Danny rides his bicycle in the hotel’s corridors was shot with the help of this device.\n\n“The Shining” is an excellent horror movie, made by a renowned director, based on a famous writer’s novel. It portrays a dense atmosphere of despair and isolation, which is valuable when portraying the plot. Technical novelties used during the filming also contribute to the positive assessment of the film. One of the most significant factors speaking in favor of “The Shining” is Jack Nicholson’s acting ability in portraying the image of a psychotic writer, who is convincing and genuinely scary. However, in his background, other personages are lost due to the characters played by Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd looking simulated.\n\nReference\n\nKing, Stephen. The Shining.

{"prompt": "What are the negative consequences of playing video games for children and teenagers?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Video games are perhaps the most popular and widespread form of entertainment at present. Companies that develop video games earn billions of dollars and constantly invest in research aimed to make virtual reality look like reality. Their products become more and more sophisticated, and they attract a wide audience. However, despite all the joy that video games can bring to children and teenagers, who are the main target audiences of game developing companies, actively engaging in video games at such a young age can produce adverse effects.\n\nThe harm video games cause can be evaluated by several criteria, and the most obvious among them is the negative effects they can have on physical health. Though the proponents of video gaming claim first-person shooters and real-time strategies sharpen reflexes, increase concentration, and muscle coordination, in reality, teenagers who spend an ample amount of time playing games experience effects that are not so beneficial.\n\nThere is a possibility of the loss of sight. Spending hours on a computer or in front of a TV is one of the main causes of blurred vision among youth. In addition, sacrificing healthy physical activities in favor of video gaming may become a risk factor for obesity. Gamers often do not want to interrupt their playing for meals. They eat right in front of the monitor, and their rations often consist of products that can be easily cooked or eaten immediately, such as crisps, chocolate bars, crackers, or other fast foods. All this definitely does not contribute to the proper and healthy development of a young, growing body.\n\nMental health can also be affected by engaging in video games at a young age. This suggests addiction and inappropriate behavior. It is a well-known fact that many gamers (especially fans of online games) suffer from addiction, which is no less serious than narcomania or alcoholism. For instance, in August 2005, a report surfaced about the death of a 28-year-old South Korean gamer who had spent 50 hours playing a real-time strategy game (BBC). For another significant example, one needs to look no further than July 2012, when a Taiwanese teenager fatally collapsed after a 40-hour game session (Crawley). Cases like these are quite numerous and happen all around the world. They make additional arguments to the negative evaluation of video games as an activity which brings harm to young people.\n\nIn its turn, inappropriate behavior can be caused by violence in video games. According to research, children and teenagers who play violent video games tend to be more aggressive. They confront their teachers and peers more often and display a decline in academic achievements. Such psychological deviations also do not implicate video games as a constructive and useful occupation for young people (Crane).\n\nIndividuals who spend excessive hours playing video games may lack the capability to distinguish between reality from fantasies. Video games often offer simplified and conditional models of environments, relationships, friendships, and rivalries. Gamers use these models to learn to interact with the world around them, and they often lack skills that would be developed by real-life experience instead of the simulation (Crane). Therefore, it can be implied that another negative effect caused by video games is the inability of social adaptation on the part of the gamer.\n\nIt can be concluded that video games are a form of entertainment which is not suitable for children and teenagers. This assessment is based on a number of negative consequences that excessive video gaming causes. Young people who spend an inexplicable sum of hours playing video games are observed to be prone to sight loss and obesity. In addition, they tend to be more aggressive than their peers who do not play video games, and they experience difficulties with social adaptation. Also, video games can lead to addictions that are no less serious than alcoholism or narcomania, as evidenced in recent media stories reporting on deaths among inveterate video gamers. This collection of facts contributes to the negative evaluation of video games as an unwholesome activity for children and teenagers.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the main arguments against the death penalty?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Crime and punishment are two categories that are almost always associated with one another. They have become subjects of numerous scientific research studies and literary works. Numerous philosophers have reflected on the relationship and proportionality of crime and punishment. These two categories can be compared as two bowls of the same scale. It is fine when they complement each other, but if they are skewed, it causes negative consequences. Among all possible punishments, the death penalty is the most extreme, and likely, the most ineffective and unfair type of punishment for any crime. However, there are many proponents with opposing viewpoints.\n\nTo begin with, capital punishment cannot be economically justified. At first glance, it may seem maintaining a life-term prisoner is more burdensome for taxpayers. However, according to Richard C. Dieter, the cost of a death penalty may amount to or even surpass the expenditures of handling less-severe punishments for similar cases. The imposition of capital punishment requires complicated and numerous trials which can take a great amount of time. During this period, the defendant remains incarcerated and his or her maintenance is paid for with taxpayers’ money. Additional pre-trial time is needed to impose a death sentence with the involvement law experts, attorneys, and additional trials (Dieter). All of these procedures require additional expenditures, which make a death trial a costly venture.\n\nThe second argument that speaks against the efficiency of the death penalty is its obvious immorality and contradiction to all norms of humanity and justice. Execution is, in a sense, a judicial murder. Murder definitely goes against the proclaimed values of human life, even if it involves the life of a murderer. Stated succinctly, the death penalty is meant to show killing is wrong, by killing a killer. This act is condoned by people who state the inadmissibility of taking away the life of a living being. Therefore, the role of the death penalty as a way of reducing violence in any society seems to be unconvincing.\n\nThough it may be denied, racial and ethnic prejudices still function in modern societies. People are often guided with stereotypes when making decisions or assessing the behaviors of others, and jury members sometimes do not make any exceptions. According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, 50 percent of American convicts on death row are African-Americans. Also, it is stated that between the years 2006 and 2011, 48 percent of the defendants in court cases where a death penalty was sought were African-Americans (NAACP). Xenophobic manifestations when holding a judicial decision are unfair by default, but they take on a special meaning when it comes to imposing a death sentence. In other words, if this kind of punishment is used mainly for a group of people who are different by racial and ethnic origins, it cannot be called a fair and efficient measure of punishment.\n\nOne of the most important functions of the judicial system is to punish criminals and to protect the innocent. However, mistakes happen and innocent people are sometimes wrongly accused, or the punishment they receive does not match the extent of their crimes. Here, another manifestation of the ineffectiveness of the death penalty can easily be seen. When actuated, it cannot be canceled or changed. When a person is executed, it does not matter whether the case is reviewed later and the executed is then found innocent. This fact significantly reduces the efficiency of the death penalty, because it appears to be a rigid and disproportionate measure.\n\nIn addition, there is no credible evidence that the death penalty is a judicial practice that helps reduce the number of crimes committed, compared to life imprisonment as a punishment. Sometimes, a life-term incarceration penalty may be even more of a deterrent for criminals than an execution, especially if state prison conditions are known to be harsh.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the benefits and drawbacks of standardized tests?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Standardized tests are a common and popular way to evaluate the academic achievements of students, teachers, and school districts. They are used in many areas, such as in the army, civil service, medicine, and so on, but primarily standardized tests are associated with academic performance. Many arguments in favor of the usage of these tests have been put forward, as well as a number against, since this method of monitoring and evaluating academic success has both benefits and drawbacks.\n\nStandardized tests are most widely used in the field of education to assess the academic performance of students. Two commonly known types of standardized tests in the USA are the SAT and the ACT. The SAT evaluates skills in vocabulary and mathematics, while the ACT has more to do with a broader range of knowledge and includes additional subjects, such as science. Among the other most-known tests are the PSAT, National Achievement Tests, and SAT II examinations.\n\nOne of the main purposes of testing is to set a standard: a performance baseline of progress for all parties involved in the educational process—students, teachers, and school districts, and to hold them accountable for achieving it. The idea is to detect areas where students usually fail, or fall behind and promote improvement, not punish them (Strong 24). Besides, tests help remove bias some teachers may exhibit towards students and make the evaluation process more objective. This is usually achieved by using special automatic machines that score exams. Also, due to the usage of these methods, the potential of human error is decreased, or even eliminated.\n\nOn the other hand, the exploitation of the system of standardized testing is linked to a number of issues. Thus, many feel that tests do not provide accurate evaluations of a student’s knowledge and learning capabilities, particularly due to the fact that in order to pass a test, rote memorization is preferred to critical thinking and higher learning (Strong 254). Critics of standardized testing often claim it contributes to the rise of academic dishonesty, as the pursuit of knowledge becomes a pursuit of higher test scores. Besides, the emotional state of students may be destabilized due to test-taking. The environment, fostering constant competition and even rivalry may create excessive stress and test-anxiety. A person who gets a low test score may become discouraged from pursuing further academic success. Perhaps one of the most serious drawbacks of using standardized testing is connected to discrimination. Holding all schools and students to the same national standards may infringe on the rights of students with disabilities, lower socio-economic statuses, those who learn English as a second language, students of different nationalities, and so on.\n\nOne can see that standardized testing is a universal method of evaluating those skills to which tests are targeted, which aim to reduce or even excludes bias, partiality, or the potential of human error. Standardized tests are meant to set a high standard and promote objectivity. However, this method is not perfect and involves a number of issues. The most critical among them are the preference accorded to memorization over critical and analytic thinking; the encouragement of academic dishonesty; infringing on students’ emotional state, and even some elements of discrimination. Evaluating both sides of the argument allows for improvements to be made, while still encouraging students to strive for the highest academic achievement.\n\nReference\n\nStrong, Malena.
