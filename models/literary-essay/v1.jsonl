{"prompt": "Tone is the mood or feeling the author intends the reader to experience. Using a specific piece of literature, explain how tone enhances the work.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Writers for TV sitcoms or movies are fortunate. Visuals often convey tone much more conveniently than words. Writers have to be very skillful in word choice in order to evoke emotions. While I began to explore Edgar Allan Poe’s works, I was intrigued with the way Poe carefully chose language and with the way it evoked a very certain mood or tone.\n\nIn Poe’s “The Tell-Tale Heart”, I was amazed with the way the main character could grow to hate someone’s physical appearance so much so that he could stare at him for hours on end. The plot of this story revolves around a young man who rents a room from an elderly man in a large, dark mansion. This is how Poe begins to create the tone or mood. If the setting were in a house with a white picket fence in Pleasantville, the setting might not be as effective for suspense or horror. However, Poe begins to masterfully build suspense in “The Tell-Tale Heart”. For example, the deranged tenant slowly opens the elderly man’s bedroom door at night and stares at his glass eye for hours in a seething rage. He does this numerous times, to where the reader begins to understand that this man is far from normal. His obsession leads him to commit a horrible crime.\n\nThe rage this man feels about the eye finally comes to a point wherein he attacks the man and suffocates him in his bed. Afterwards, he dismembers his corpse and hides the pieces under the floorboards. By now, the reader is in complete disbelief and awe at such a heinous, non-provoked attack, that we must continue reading. The tone becomes very eerie, and will soon turn suspenseful.\n\nFinally, the police investigate the home after a neighbor reported hearing screams coming from the house. The deranged man invites the police in, and invites them to sit with him in the room where the corpse lies. Poe now adds to the tone with more suspense and a feeling of anxiety to whether the man will confess to the murder. While speaking with the police, the man begins to hear a faint heartbeat that continues to grow in volume. However, he is the only one who hears the noise. The man attempted to cunningly fool the police officers while sitting on the corpse, only to now mentally break down from the noise inside his mind to where he confesses. The torture this man evokes on himself adds tremendously to the tone of the story.\n\nJust as Poe creates an eerie, intense, and twisted tone to his fiction, authors can lead their readers to feel certain emotions through their writing.###"}
{"prompt": "In the novel, The Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, a group of boys are stranded on a remote island to fend for themselves. Compare/contrast this novel to the popular television show Survivor. Use specific details in your answer.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " William Golding’s novel The Lord of the Flies explores many themes such as the dark side of human nature, allegiances, and how these boys mirror larger society. I feel as if the producers of the popular television show “Survivor” used this novel as the framework of their show. Both Golding’s novel and the show have many similarities.\n\nWhen the show “Survivor” premiered, I immediately thought of the novel The Lord of the Flies. The novel is about a group of schoolboys who are shipwrecked on a deserted island. The boys attempt to create a “civilization,” but ultimately transform into mere savages. This is an important novel for the psychological study Golding presents. One can’t help but draw parallels to adult society. There is a true need for structure and control in any society, but the means of that control makes this novel all the more interesting.\n\nOne of the boys, Jack, is power-hungry and represents dictatorship. Some of the other boys such as Simon and Piggy try to do what is safe and conservative. The character of Ralph is symbolic of democracy and fairness. Throughout the novel, the boys engage in a power struggle and end up destroying one another. Golding’s use of symbolism forces the reader to see characters and situations as larger ideas. The boys realize that they must create some type of order.\n\nSimilar to the television show “Survivor”, the boys hold council meetings, use objects as a symbol of strength, and use fire as a symbol of hope. I remember watching the show and observing a contestant who won a physical contest against the other players. This person was given a pillow to use, whereas the other contestants had nothing. The pillow symbolizes power, as did the conch in the novel. Also, whenever the show’s council met on Sunday nights, they all brought their torches. When someone was voted off the island (seen as a liability or risk to the welfare of the group), that person’s torch was extinguished, thus eliminating hope. Alliances were formed and these alliances pitted the contestants against each other. Ultimately the winner was the most cunning player who could convince the other members to follow them. This is exactly the situation that occurred between Ralph and Jack in the novel.\n\nWilliam Golding’s novel allows the reader to explore human nature and mankind. Often, we do not like to face the psychological aspects of our being. “Survivor” emulates the same underlying motives that form our nature.###"}
{"prompt": "Using a specific literary work, explain how a novel might influence change in society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Have you ever read a story that ultimately changed the way in which you thought about the world?\n\nSo often we form our opinions and lifestyles from our families and what we observe around us. Could it be possible that a novel might change the way in people’s thinking? After reading Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mockingbird, I realized for the first time how complex racism was, and the necessity for societal change.\n\nI have always been aware of cultural and racial differences in others. I was raised to accept people for their differences and judge people solely on their character.\n\nHowever, I wasn’t aware of the problems encountered by black people in the Deep South during the 1940s. In her novel, Lee makes it apparent that the color of skin was a determinant of social stature, no matter your character. I felt that having a first person narrator, told from the perspective of a young girl in the South was a brilliant way to tell this story. Scout is at the age where she is only beginning to understand how society handles diversity and cultural differences. A black man, Tom Robinson, is accused of raping a white woman, even though none of the evidence points to him. For example, the narrator is a young girl named Scout. Her father, Atticus Finch, is a well-respected, highly moral lawyer who is defending Tom. Even though Atticus finds evidence contrary to the accusations, he has no hope of winning this trial. Scout fights a boy in her class who tells her that her father is defending a “(racial slur)”. Scout now begins to come to terms with her assumptions about people.\n\nAn interesting point is made in this novel. While the white people of this small town in Alabama discuss the horrors of Hitler persecuting Jewish people, Scout wonders how the same people could not understand that the white people of her town were doing the same to the blacks. This sends a powerful message to the reader through such a vivid analogy.\n\nThis novel elicits the reader to think about race relations and social bigotry. There are decent, moral black characters in this novel that are doomed because of their skin color. However, Lee portrays low class white families, such as Bob’s, undeserving of respect, but able to live on a much higher social stature than the blacks. When Tom Robinson is killed escaping from prison, the town barely takes notice.\n\nThrough Lee’s novel, society is faced with the vulgarities of race and social class, along with the racism of this Southern town. Her message that neither race nor class, but actions, define someone’s character leave the reader with important social issues to be re-examined.###"}
{"prompt": "The theme of a literary piece is the central idea or message that it delivers. Cite a specific literary work and discuss the theme.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Theme is the underlying message an author presents to his or her audience. Many times the theme of a work is apparent. Often we ask ourselves upon completing a novel, “What did that character learn at the end?” We base our judgment of characters on our cultural beliefs and emotions we experience in our lives. In Herman Hesse’s Siddartha, the theme seems apparent—fulfillment in life through spiritual peace.\n\nThe main character, Siddartha, takes the reader on his life’s journey to find truth and meaning in life. He decides to leave home with his childhood friend, Govinda. The setting of this story is India, with the social caste system as the motivation for his journey. Siddartha realizes that he yearns for more knowledge and understanding; far more that his father can provide him with. He seeks spiritual fulfillment and wisdom. Even though this story is set in India, the theme is universal. Just as many of us decide to go on to college to learn more about the world, and ourselves; Siddartha does the same.\n\nAt different stages of his journey he acquires wisdom, learns as much as he can, and forges on to new experiences. Siddartha is not unlike a person today in our culture. Many of us challenge ourselves with new ideas and experiences. Sometimes we fail, other times we succeed. However, what unifies us is the desire to explore the unknown. The trade-off is we may discover we are much happier after taking those risks, than if we never ventured out. This is the theme in Siddartha. It is the message that is universal. In fact, there is a very popular book out now about moving cheese. It is a metaphor for the same theme as in Siddartha. Moving out of our comfort zones into a new, unfamiliar arena, hoping to find what it is we are looking for.\n\nSiddartha goes through both pleasant and unpleasant experiences in this novel. At one point, he acquires incredible wealth and has every material possession he could ever dream of. However, at this point in his life, he contemplates suicide! He has become so gluttonous that he sickens himself. He realizes material possessions cannot bring him peace. From this scene, the theme of attaining spiritual peace is strengthened. How many times have we come across people with enormous wealth, but little peace and fulfillment in their lives?\n\nSiddartha is a great novel and its theme is apparent. The quest for spiritual peace, wisdom, and self-understanding is unpredictable, but attainable through the trials of life and what it has to offer.###"}
{"prompt": "Compare/contrast the fear of terrorism and the concern with safety issues in present day society with George Orwell’s novel, 1984.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The events of September 11th shattered our belief that we as Americans are immune to terrorism and its proponents. Our society has taken for granted security and free will. However, heightened measures have been taken in public arenas to bolster our safety. With this heightened security comes the forfeiture of some civil liberties that George Orwell wrote about in his novel 1984.\n\nIn his novel, Orwell was writing from the perspective of nation that recently endured a world war. Orwell wrote his novel in 1948, and simply rotated the last two digits in the year to explore what the world might be like in the future. In this world that Orwell writes about, the government has surveillance in every imaginable public space. There is also a law enforcement collaborative called the “thought police.” In this society, no one could have anti-governmental sentiment whether vocalized or internalized. If you violated this law, “Big Brother” took you away. This government, (Big Brother), supposedly gave the citizens what they needed in order to survive. In this cold, mundane society, there was always a camera somewhere watching you. I think it is appropriate to assume that this society was under Communist rule, and Orwell was indeed frightening his readers to the thought of such a threat. This threat was very significant in the times this novel was written. Orwell was conveying the themes of manipulation of the truth and loss of identity. In our present day society, there are many parallels to Orwell’s novel.\n\nSince September 11th, our government has taken steps in order to tighten security and minimize terrorist attacks. By the same token, members of our society must forfeit certain civil liberties. For example, if you travel by air now, you must arrive extremely early before departure, your belongings are scrutinized more closely, and you may have to be patted down or asked to remove your shoes. These actions seem to be intrusive, but most people will accept them to ensure safety.\n\nFurthermore, it is becoming commonplace to find video cameras in many public arenas. Many airports, stores, and offices install cameras for surveillance. Technology has produced cameras that are so small, they can be installed in a shirt or jacket button. Many parents install cameras in their homes to monitor activity if they must leave and hire a sitter. Many police vehicles are equipped with video recorders so that the tape might yield evidence in court. There are even popular television shows that air actual surveillance tapes. This is eerily reminiscent of what occurs in Orwell’s 1984.\n\nAlthough we have no thought police, nor do we live under totalitarian rule, our society has definitely surrendered its privacy in order to protect its freedom. Orwell seemed to understand how technology can influence society and its freedoms.###"}
{"prompt": "Personification is the technique wherein a non-human character is given human thoughts, feelings, and dialogue. Illustrate how this technique is used in your favorite novel or short story.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Personification is a clever technique wherein non-human characters are given human characteristics. Using this technique, the reader is able to understand how an animal feels, or what a tree is thinking, or even the most intimate thoughts of an old pair of sneakers! Rudyard Kipling’s “RikkiTikki-Tavi” is one of my favorite short stories. In it, all of the animals are personified, which is crucial because the protagonist is a mongoose.\n\nRikki-Tikki-Tavi is a small mongoose who nearly drowns after a flood sweeps him away from his home. A boy named Teddy finds the mongoose, and he and his mother nurse the animal back to health. Rikki never converses in English with his human family, however he does interact with the other animals in the garden, speaking in English. I find this technique to be helpful in formulating the plot. For example, a mongoose’s natural enemy is the cobra. Kipling uses these two enemies in the wild and makes them the protagonist and antagonist of the short story. Throughout the story, RikkiTikki finds himself battling adversaries in the garden in an effort to save Teddy’s family.\n\nThis story follows the archetype of the battle between good and evil. If we look closely at the plot, biblical themes are apparent. Snakes in the garden may remind some of the biblical story of Adam and Eve. Without personification in this biblical story, Eve might not have been tempted if the serpent didn’t have the ability to speak. Although Rikki-Tikki cannot converse with the humans in the story, the reader is able to understand his character and his thoughts. For example, before he battles Nag, the male antagonist serpent, he is cautious and a bit nervous. However, he won’t show his fear to his enemy. Only the reader understands Rikki’s character from this point of view.\n\nRudyard Kipling was clever enough to observe what occurs in nature, blending it with personification, and creating a timeless story of good versus evil.###"}
{"prompt": "Many times in Shakespeare’s plays, the setting changes from rural or pastoral to urban. Compare and contrast these settings. Explain the reason for the shift of scenery, using support from specific plays.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Many times in Shakespeare’s works, the setting changes from a city to a pastoral venue. Although change in setting is expected, there is an underlying reason why he chooses these specific areas. In his play A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the setting changes from the city of Athens to a forest near the city. The characters behave very differently in each setting.\n\nThe play deals with marriages, love, family, and non-conformity. The Duke of Athens is about to be married to a woman who he recently defeated in war. Another element of the plot deals with a young woman whose father is demanding she marry a man she is not in love with. The woman decides to run away to the forest with the man she does love. There are two distinct settings here and I believe Shakespeare was mirroring human nature in the change of scenery. Often when someone is faced with a pressing problem or decision, they will retreat either physically to a quiet place to meditate, or they might go out with friends in order to take release from the issue or problem. Similarly in this play, the forest is viewed as a place of “nonreality,” or a dream world. Fairies and supernatural beings inhabit the forest. This is a place of refuge that contrasts the conformity of the city. There are, however, similarities in both settings.\n\nJust as the Duke of Athens is marrying Hippolyta, there is King Oberon and his queen in the forest. Both couples are learning about the trials of love. There are colorful characters in both venues that keep the audience entertained also. One such character who lives in the forest is Puck. Puck is a fairy-type character who plays tricks on the characters and ultimately tries to teach them lessons throughout the play. One of the more famous lines from Shakespeare is found in this work when Puck states, “Oh what fools these mortals be.” There are lessons to be learned in both the city and the forest, but the forest is more of a dream world or an escape from reality.\n\nShakespeare cleverly changes the setting in this play to expose human folly and lends keen insight into human nature.###"}
{"prompt": "A third type of conflict is called character vs. him/herself. This is also referred to as internal conflict, because the character must face self-inflicted fears and problems. Write about this type of conflict, using a piece of literature that you have read.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In many literary works there is a central conflict. Conflict can occur in many ways. There is character versus another character, character versus an outside force like nature, and internal conflict, where a character must battle themselves mentally and emotionally. Often these types of conflicts can occur simultaneously in a literary work. I have chosen to discuss my favorite type of conflict in one of my favorite plays by Shakespeare; Hamlet.\n\nInternal conflict is the most intricate of all the types of conflict. We may read about a character that must physically defend themselves against another character. Also, there are many characters that have to brave the elements and survive in life-threatening situations. For example, Ishmael, the narrator and sole survivor in Herman Melville’s Moby Dick tells the story of the giant white whale. But the most intense is internal conflict. In Shakespeare’s Hamlet, a young prince must battle his conscience.\n\nHamlet, the main character, has recently lost his father. While he is still mourning, his mother marries his father’s brother, Claudius. However, Hamlet’s father’s ghost appears to him and shows him the foul play that surrounded his death. Hamlet learns that his uncle actually murdered his father! This is where internal conflict is most present. In one of the most famous Shakespearian lines, Hamlet ponders, “To be, or not to be . . . ”. Hamlet must now decide whether to take action and avenge his father’s death, or to remain passive. This decision weighs so heavily on his conscience, that others notice a drastic change in his behavior. Hamlet must decide if being passive is the equivalent of being a coward. Eventually, this play comes to a tragic end, and Hamlet decides to avenge his father’s murder.\n\nI believe that internal conflict works ideally in literature. Of course, Shakespeare presents Hamlet’s internal conflict through soliloquy, and this was performed on stage, but when you are able to read what a person is struggling through, you can more closely relate to the character. Internal conflict conjures up the fears that many of us have in everyday life. Hopefully ours are not as tragic as Hamlets were!###"}
{"prompt": "Discuss a piece of literature in which the author is also the narrator. Describe the way he or she uses actual events from his or her life in his or her writing.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In literature, there are varying points of view in relaying the events. If the narrator was actually part of the events, this is called first-person narration. When the narrator is merely telling a story, but was not part of the events, this is third-person narration. At times, a reader might be thankful that the narrator is only telling a story as the events unfold, especially if the main characters are in some sort of danger. I personally enjoy first-person narration because you are allowed into the mind of the main character. This was especially enjoyable while reading J.D. Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye.\n\nThe main character, Holden Caufield, is the narrator as well. He is a very complex character who doesn’t seem to fit in socially. Salinger creates the world from Holden’s point of view. Although Holden seems apathetic towards many things in his life such as his schoolwork and friends, he is a deeply sensitive character marred by his view of the world. For example, in the beginning of the novel, Holden questions why his roommates are so popular and can converse so well, especially with members of the opposite sex. His insecurities are revealed so that the reader can explore his character and perhaps identify with him. If Salinger had written this as a third-person narration, the reader might not understand Holden’s character as well.\n\nEven though Holden Caufield is a tragic character, and many of his actions are not the most beneficial, Salinger allows us to identify with Holden’s insecurities and private dealings, many of which the reader might identify with.###"}
{"prompt": "The coming of age theme is very popular in literature. This term refers to a pre-adolescent boy or girl going through many difficult, life altering experiences in order to reach young adulthood. Using a novel you are familiar with, discuss this theme. Be sure to use supporting details and evidence in your essay.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The theme “coming of age” is a common one, where an adolescent boy or girl is faced with decisions that ultimately lead them into adulthood. Barn Burning, by William Faulkner, embodies this theme with messages of family loyalty and morality.\n\nThe story is set in the South, roughly thirty years after the Civil War. The main character who comes of age is Sarty Snopes, an adolescent whose father, Ab Snopes is a poor sharecropper frustrated by the post-Civil War Aristocracy. Sarty’s father is a very destructive, immoral character. In the South at this time, if a person wanted to deliver the most potent form of revenge against their neighbor, they would have someone burn their barn down. This crude assault makes perfect sense considering the main income providing lot was agriculture and livestock. If a person lost their barn where these things were stored, their lives would ultimately be ruined. Ab and his son drift from place to place, and Ab makes money as a hired “hit” for barns. His son is deeply troubled by his father’s destructiveness, but follows along out of “blood,” or the loyalty of family regardless of the activities.\n\nThroughout the novel, Sarty is faced with internal conflict. He knows that his father is doing something highly illegal and immoral; however, he wishes to remain loyal to family. Faulkner explores this coming of age theme with real depth and conviction, as the boy struggles with his conscience.\n\nThe climax of this novel comes when the boy and his father are taken in by a warm, friendly man who provides the two with meals, lodging, and conversation. Sarty takes a genuine liking to the man; however, he knows that his father plans to burn the man’s barn down. Although he tries to convince his father not to commit this heinous act, Ab takes the boy in the middle of the night towards the barn. Sarty makes the hardest decision of his life and warns the man. In the closing scene, a gunshot is heard and the reader can assume that the father has been caught and killed. Sarty has crossed the threshold of pre-adolescence and has deceived “blood” in order to preserve his morality.\n\nWilliam Faulkner’s Barn Burning is a remarkable story of coming of age, where a boy must make the ultimate decision and thus becomes a man.###"}
{"prompt": "Discuss how the reader might sympathize with the main character in Christopher Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus, even though he sells his soul to the Devil.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The familiar adage about selling one’s soul to the devil conjures up two distinct images—dabbling with the occult and being granted magical gifts.\n\nAlthough most people would not want to or would not dare to cross into such dangerous territory, Dr. John Faustus, the renowned scholar in this Elizabethan tragedy, could not resist.\n\nChristopher Marlowe, author of Dr. Faustus, created a complex character in the play of the same name. This character is tragic, foolish, ambitious, intelligent, and pitied. For all the good and bad traits he has, the audience cannot help but share in Faustus’ regret at the end of the play.\n\nFaustus has mastered many disciplines and is a well-known scholar. However, he yearns for more knowledge beyond the realm of what is offered. Faustus summons the occult and encounters a demon named Mephistopheles, a servant to Lucifer. Faustus makes an offer to give his soul to the devil in exchange for twenty-four years of magic. Mephistopheles tries to dissuade Faustus from such a fate, but Faustus persists until the deal has been made. Once this occurs, Faustus is ready to satisfy his ambitions.\n\nAt this point in the play, the audience—although apprehensive about Faustus’ choice—is just as curious as he was about magic and infinite knowledge. Faustus wants to learn the secrets of the universe. He also wants a wife. Basically, he desires the things that most humans desire, and this is where Marlowe captures the audience’s empathy. We know that what Faustus has done is immoral and tragic, but we want to share in this display of power as he entertains courts by summoning historical spirits. The audience has pity for Faustus when he has bouts with his conscience. For example, at one point he prays desperately to God for forgiveness, but the audience realizes that no matter how desperate or how much he pleads, the devil will make sure the contract is honored. What is particularly powerful at the end of the play is the torment and desperation Faustus experiences as he fights the clock and tries to hold back time. But, the hours and minutes close in on his fate. Colleagues find his body the next day, and the audience realizes that he has been dragged down to hell.\n\nAlthough the audience can blame Faustus for summoning the occult and bringing this tragedy on himself, Marlowe creates such a complex character that he is to be pitied for his choices.###"}

What makes Angelou heroic, I think, is her perseverance over a multitude of odds.\n\nIn the beginning of the novel, the reader learns that Angelou is living with her grandmother because her birth mother abandoned her.

{"prompt": "Write a literary analysis of a Robert Frost poem. Include theme and symbolism in your discussion.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Frost’s comforting, sad, and often poignant poetry is usually filled with metaphors and vivid imagery. Perhaps my favorite Frost poem is “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.” The imagery creates a memorable portrait of the beauty and power of nature.\n\nNear the beginning, the narrator is introduced as a working man, who has stopped to rest: “My little horse must think it queer / To stop without a farmhouse near.” The narrator suggests that his days are mostly spent in labor, moving from place to place. On a whim, he stops riding to watch the “woods fill up with snow.” During this brief moment, the narrator achieves spiritual transcendence and peace as he connects with nature.\n\nThroughout the poem, the narrator’s horse is a symbol of daily labor and the constant struggle of civilization. Taken from the wilds of nature, domesticated, and trained to obey orders, the horse no longer has any appreciation of nature. While the narrator relaxes in the woods, his horse “gives his harness bells a shake / To ask if there is some mistake.” The irony here is that the man becomes even more connected to nature than the once-wild beast he rides.\n\nIt’s important that this event takes place during “The darkest evening of the year” because the darkness allows the narrator to be hidden from the civilized and unnatural world he lives in every day. At the same time, the darkness of the evening is ironic because the narrator can’t really see the beauty of the woods very clearly. In this way, Frost suggests that nature’s beauty is more than just visual. It’s spiritual too. In the “lovely, dark and deep” woods, the narrator is able to fully appreciate the beauty of nature without seeing it.\n\nAfter his brief moment of peace, the narrator must return to the working world. The line, “And miles to go before I sleep” is repeated at the end to show how weary and tired the narrator has become. Here, the “miles” represent long spans of time. He has a long time to wait before he gets home that night, and he also has a long time to wait before he reaches the ultimate sleep of death. But in this poem, the idea of death isn’t negative because when the narrator dies, he will finally be permanently reunited with the beauty of nature.###"}
{"prompt": "Compare the society of The Scarlet Letter to our society today. Compare and contrast how Hester Prynne would have been treated today with how she was treated in the novel.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Hester Prynne, from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, would not necessarily have fared much better today than in her own time. Some of the Puritanical influences in Salem, Massachusetts at that time still exist in modern society. Public ridicule remains an integral part of our culture, infidelity is still deplored, and unfortunately, women are still often seen as the more guilty party of any extramarital affair.\n\nIn The Scarlet Letter, Reverend Dimmsdale is a spiritual leader of the community. However, he impregnates a young woman named Hester Prynne, who believes her husband has died at sea. As a result of their affair, Hester is forced to wear a scarlet “A” on her chest and stand in the midst of the town on a scaffold. Meanwhile, Dimmsdale keeps his distance and remains silent out of fear. In modern times, it would be hard to imagine anyone who has had an affair being forced to wear a red letter on his or her clothes for all to see, but, at the same time, public ridicule has become a part of modern culture as well. Celebrities are publically ridiculed on the covers of tabloid magazines every day, and the details of their private lives are frequently broadcast on shows like Access Hollywood. In our society, extramarital affairs have become public knowledge. From celebrities to politicians, one way or another, affairs make news and sell papers.\n\nAlso, in the book, Hester Prynne is unfairly singled out as the guilty one as a result of Dimmesdale’s silence. Even now, it is often the woman who is viewed as the immoral one with poor judgment. Although Dimmesdale finally delivers a powerful sermon toward the end of the novel, confessing to the affair before his congregation, he dies—rather conveniently—shortly after, thereby escaping any punishment or public ridicule. So, in the end, Hester Prynne may not have been treated much better in our times. For its portrayal of this timeless situation, The Scarlet Letter remains a viable novel.###"}
