{"prompt": "What is your favorite place?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Richmond Beach was my spiritual hangout in my childhood. It is a rocky beach in the city of Richmond Beach, which can be accessed by a long downhill drive (by car or bicycle) from the city of Edmonds. Or, as I did often, took the 30-minute walk from my house to the calm waters through a tranquil stroll through the woods of Woodway. It used to be a place inhabited by Native Americans, but now it is occupied by mostly Caucasian people. However, a totem pole stands in tribute to the tribes that used to call the beach home. It has a vast property, with a beach, a playground, two upper lawns for the view and recreation, myriad “secret” trails along the clay hillsides, picnic areas, and a square where people can walk around, take an outdoor rinse-shower after a swim, and benches for the spectacular view.\n\nWith the sagebrush, chattering birds, train tracks, the croak of frogs, wind, herons, various shells, a cave along the beach, and a fantastic view of the Olympic Mountains, Richmond Beach is at once ordinary and extraordinary. Being there brings you into another state, in which you want to introspect, be calm, and be positive.\n\nIn high school, I was not a very social person. I did not have so many friends, and I did not feel like I belonged in a group most of the time. But when I went to Richmond Beach, these worries were left behind. It seemed like a mystical place to me, and in a way, it still does.\n\nI would walk to various places on the beach: a secret cave in the clay hills on the left, the train tracks that lead all the way from Seattle to Chicago, the mass of sagebrush where the melody of birds made for a serene scene, and of course the beach itself, which was scattered with shells, tide pools, crabs, seals, driftwood, remnants of parties, and more.\n\nThe passing trains always attracted me there as well. My first word was “choo choo,” since the first three years of my life was near a train station in the Greenlake area of Seattle. So, I had a calling towards trains since my birth. Walking the tracks, I would meet interesting people, learn to know when trains were coming through the vibration and singing of the rails, and would be immersed in a world with a forest on one side and the Puget Sound and the other. This combination of forest and ocean was enchanting, and captured my imagination.\n\nI wrote many poems about this place, and have been continually inspired by the atmosphere there. In fact, my poetry has developed largely at Richmond Beach. No where else have I written so many poems—except perhaps on public transport. I started writing lyrical and narrative poetry around 11 years of age, and have continued since. For the past few years, I have been writing almost exclusively haiku. A lot of my haiku is inspired by the nature of Richmond Beach, how I relate to it spiritually, and by the people who used to occupy that land—as I feel a special connection with Native Americans.\n\nIt seems that Richmond Beach is one of those places that no matter how bad you feel, you will leave feeling soothed and renewed. It is like therapy just to walk around, feel the ionic breeze of the Puget Sound, smell the seaweed and moisture, hear the variety of birds singing, listen to the crashing of moderate waves, witness the sailboats and other boats on the water, take in the Olympic mountains in all their glory, see people enjoying themselves on the beach, the whistle and trucking of a distant train, and feel the sand on the soles of your feet, melding into each other with each step. It is a whole therapeutic package.\n\nIt will be hard to ever forget Richmond Beach. It is now intertwined in my poetry, childhood, spiritual life, family life, romantic memories, and even the passing of my father, whose ashes was spread there. So, whenever I visit Richmond Beach, all of these elements rest in my mind and soul. There are other places that stir my imagination and supply me with sentimental rushes, but Richmond Beach is at the top of my list.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the role of pi in mathematics and physics?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Pi is usually known as a string of numbers starting from 3.14. However, it is much more than that. It is a mathematical constant. Originally, it was defined as the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. However, it now has various definitions and is in many formulas in mathematics and physics. Though it is called “pi” in English, it commonly represented by the Greek letter “π.” Anyway, in the following paragraphs, we will go into detail about its fundamentals, history, and role.\n\nPi is the most known mathematical constant. As was mentioned in the introduction, it equals the circumference of a circle divided by the diameter. According to LiveScience, “No matter how large or small a circle is, pi will always work out to be the same number. That number equals approximately 3.14, but it’s a little more complicated than that” (Hom, Elaine J.). Pi is also noted as an irrational number, which basically points to the fact that is a real number that can be shown as a simple fraction. In fact, it is what mathematicians call an “infinite decimal,” as pi’s digits go on forever. Also, there are no repeating patterns in pi.\n\nSince pi’s digits go on forever, mathematicians and scientists often approximate it. According to Wonderopolis, “For most purposes, pi can be approximated as 3.14159. Some people even shorten it to 3.14, which is why Pi Day is celebrated on March 14 (3/14)” (“What Is Pi?”). What is interesting is that computers have calculated pi to over three trillion digits. Some people even remember 1000s of digits of pi as a mental exercise.\n\nBut where did this number come from? Surprisingly, this formula has been in use for over 4000 years. The first people to discover pi was the Babylonians. According to Exploratorium, “The ancient Babylonians calculated the area of a circle by taking 3 times the square of its radius, which gave a value of pi = 3. One Babylonian tablet (ca. 1900–1680 BC) indicates a value of 3.125 for π, which is a closer approximation. The Egyptians calculated the area of a circle by a formula that gave the approximate value of 3.1605 for π” (“A Brief History of Pi (π)”). However, the first calculation of pi was completed by Archimedes (287–212 BC). Yet, he knew he did not find the value of pi, but rather an approximation of its value, with him stating that pi was between  3 1/7 and 3 10/71.\n\nPi has many roles. In mathematics, “Most geometry students first encounter pi when they study circles and learn that the area of a circle is equal to pi times the square of the length of the radius.” It is also used widely in trigonometry. Formulae concerning circles, spheres, or ellipses commonly use pi.  Here are some common formulae that use it:\nThe circumference of a circle with radius r is 2πr.\nThe area of a circle with radius r is πr2.\nThe volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3πr3.\nThe surface area of a sphere with radius r is 4πr2.\n(A Guide Book to Mathematics)\n\nIn physics, pi is also commonplace. According to LiveScience, “Pi also appears in the physics that describes waves, such as ripples of light and sound. It even enters into the equation that defines how precisely we can know the state of the universe, known as Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. A river’s windiness is determined by its “meandering ratio,” or the ratio of the river’s actual length to the distance from its source to its mouth as the crow flies” (Wolchover, Natalie). Therefore, pi has many applications in physics as well.\n\nPi is surprisingly in popular culture. There is an even a day celebrated for this mathematical constant. However, most do not know that it was first discovered by the ancient Babylonians and refined by Archimedes. Also, many people do not know that it is an irrational number that equals the circumference of a circle divided by the diameter. This special formula has many applications in mathematics, physics, and even more areas.###"}
{"prompt": "What is Bitcoin and how has it revolutionized currency?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin is currently a craze. It is a cryptocurrency, or electronic cash. It is marked by its decentralized nature without a central bank or administrator. The currency can be sent from user to user on the Bitcoin network without a middleman. In this respect, Bitcoin has been revolutionary. Though there are other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin, it is the most prominent one. In order to understand more about this phenomenon, this essay will explore the history and inner workings of this digital currency.\n\nThere is not much known about the inventor of Bitcoin. Though the person who authored it is known as Satoshi Nakamoto, his identity is not fully known. At any rate, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered on the 18th of August, 2008. According to Business Insider, “Two months later, a paper entitled ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ was passed around a cryptography mailing list. The paper is the first instance of the mysterious figure, Satoshi Nakamoto’s appearance on the web, and permanently links the name “Satoshi Nakamoto” to the cryptocurrency. Among Bitcoin’s earliest enthusiasts was Hal Finney, a console game developer and an early member of the “cypherpunk movement” who discovered Nakamoto’s proposal for Bitcoin through the cryptocurrency mailing list” (Bernard, Zoë). Finney became the first receiver of a Bitcoin transaction. On January 3rd of 2009, the Bitcoin network was created by Nakamoto by mining the first block of the chain—otherwise known as the genesis block. According to Wired, “For a year or so, his creation remained the province of a tiny group of early adopters. But slowly, word of bitcoin spread beyond the insular world of cryptography. It has won accolades from some of digital currency’s greatest minds” (Wallace, Benjamin). The greatest earliest supporters of Bitcoin came from cyberpunk enthusiasts and digital currency creators.\n\nThe progress and popularity of Bitcoin was gradual. By 2010, the first commercial transaction using Bitcoin was made by Laszlo Hanyecz to buy Papa John’s pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin (Kharpal, Arjun). After this time, Nakamoto mined up to one million bitcoins, and disappeared. Before he left, though, he gave the network alert key and control of the code repository to Gavin Andresen, a software developer. This led him to become the lead developer for the Bitcoin Foundation (Vigna, Paul).\n\n2011 marked a significant year for the digital currency. Bitcoin made “proof-of-concept” transactions with black markets such as Silk Road—the first modern darknet market, which mostly sold illegal drugs. For 30 months, Silk Road exclusively used Bitcoin to make translations. Overall, 9.9 million bitcoins were employed by them, which amounts to 214 million dollars. From these types of transactions and partnerships, the price of a bitcoin started at $0.30, but grew to as much as $31.50 in June of that year. Later, however, the price of a bitcoin dropped back down to $4.77. Another big happening was the creation of the first spin off of Bitcoin: Litecoin. From this first “altcoin” came many other variations and takes on cryptocurrency (McMillan, Robert).\n\nFast forward to 2019 and Bitcoin currency has fluctuated a lot but has also raised its value significantly over the years—especially from its humble beginnings. Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are at once praised and criticized enthusiastically. The market for these coins are mostly volatile but there is perhaps a brighter future for them in terms of stability. Unfortunately, Bitcoin experienced hacks in 2018 and this has negatively affected its value and reliability (Chavez-Dreyfuss, Gertrude). Yet, many experts believe that in the near future, cryptocurrency will be a regular installment of the economy in many countries. This change will be perhaps gradual, but many experts say that this transformation is almost inevitable.\n\nBitcoin has created a currency revolution. Initiated by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is an open-source, person-to-person currency that is transferred digitally without middlemen or centralized control. Though the digital coin had humble beginnings in a pizza shop and black markets, it has now been used for a multitude of purposes and its price has skyrocketed since its beginnings. Though the cryptocurrency market is more volatile than regular currencies, many see Bitcoin and other companies as pioneers in a physical-money future.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some attributes of an ideal friend?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " To say what an ideal friend is is not the easiest thing to do. Each person has his or her own perception of what one would be. However, speaking generally, there are certain attributes that most people deem characteristic of an ideal friend. Loyal, trustworthy, open to show weakness, caring, reassuring, and inspiring are common qualities that the majority of people attach to ideal friends.\n\nLoyalty is a usual attribute given to ideal friends. According to Psychology Today, “Loyalty is valued early on in all of our relationships, from the time we make our first friendships. We need friends who won’t spill our secrets to others, gossip about us, or allow others to criticize us” (“The 13 Essential Traits of Good Friends”). The worst action between friends is double crossing one individual, or not keeping one’s word.\n\nAlso in the vein of loyalty, ideal friends are usually referred as being trustworthy. In a statement by Psychology Today, they say that, “Trustworthiness is often the “make or break” element in any interpersonal relationship. Any breach, regardless of perceived magnitude, can devastate a relationship. Trustworthiness is comprised of several components, including honesty, dependability, and loyalty, and while each is important to successful relationships, honesty and dependability have been identified as the most vital in the realm of friendships” (“The 13 Essential Traits of Good Friends”). In light of this, a ubiquitous pet peeve of friends is a lack of honesty, and this is at the heart of being trustworthy.\n\nIn line with being honest is also the capacity to show one’s weaknesses. According to the Book of Life, “The ideal friend doesn’t try to prove how robust and successful they are; on the contrary, quite often they let us know awkward and potentially embarrassing things about themselves. They show how much they trust us by confessing failings and sorrows which would open them up to possible humiliation from the world beyond. They offer us the gift of their vulnerability” (Cotton, Jess). That openness is treasured, as to be close to an individual, one must be willing to share his or her true feelings and states.\n\nCaring is the essence of love, many say. In the words of ReachOut.com, “Friends will come and go in your life, but more important than how long your friendships last is your friends’ acceptance of you for who you are. A good friend walks the talk and shows that they care by their actions – big and small” (“What Makes a Good Friend?”). An ideal friend cares for your well-being over any issues that may arise between you two.\n\nA part of caring is being reassuring. According to The Book of Life, “They don’t just flatter; they understand how easily we lose perspective, panic and underestimate our own ability to cope. They know we’ve got zones of fragility that need to be treated gently. Sometimes they get us to laugh at ourselves, when on our own we’d be inclined to self-pity or rage” (Cotton, Jess). Ideally, a friend will do his or her best to lift your spirits when you are down.\n\nAnother part of being uplifting is the quality of being inspiring. As The Book of Life says, “More often than it’s comfortable to admit, we don’t quite know what we think until a proper friend gently asks us to expand on a thought, to explain why we’re impressed by it and to find good answers to possible objections. They see the potential in what we’re saying when we can’t” (Cotton, Jess). So, an ideal friend allows us to expand on our ideas and for them to be greater than a momentary thought.\n\nThere are more qualities that could be spoken about when talking about an ideal friend. However, these are the most commonly mentioned. Being loyal, trustworthy, open to displaying weaknesses, caring, reassuring, and inspiring are often stated as attributes of an ideal friend.###"}
{"prompt": "How would you describe your bedroom?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The door is white, with some scratches at the bottom from my pug scraping it with her claws. My pug scratches the door when she wants to come into my room. The door handle is brown and metal. At the complete bottom of the door is a rubber flap, which I do not know the reason why it is there. The room is about three lengths of my arm span, including the closet.\n\nThe floor in my room is wooden, and it creaks when stepped on. However, I do have one white, plush carpet approximately in the middle of the floor. It is rather clean-looking, considering it is white and that it is not washed regularly.\n\nTo the left of the door is a leather chair, of which is of no particular use, besides hanging half-used clothes on it. Past the chair is my electronic station, where I charge my phone at night, and charge my shaver during the day. Also, center-left is a rectangular window overlooking our backyard garden and swimming pool. It is a pleasant view for a cold room.\n\nCenter-left and far-left is my queen-size bed, with white and grey covers, and white and other colors for the blanket. The blanket in particular has a floral design and is heavy. My pillow has a white case and nothing else to it. The frame of the bed is wooden and beige in color.\n\nAbove, to the right of the bed, is a narrow, elongated window, which allows one to view the sky and neighbor’s fence. On the sill, there is a candle lamp, of which I never use. I can often find dead insects on the sill as well, such as flies.\n\nBelow that window is my meditation altar to the right, and a small table to the left of the altar, which houses books and random papers. It is barely big enough to hold these books and papers in an organized fashion. My meditation altar is covered in a red cotton cloth and features a picture of my meditation teacher. There is a candle in front of the picture of my teacher.\n\nTo the right of the altar is my closet, which contains a rack of sweaters, a suit, scarfs, and belts. There is also a brown, lean dresser, which has the rest of my clothes in it. On the floor, below the rack, there are miscellaneous items, such as an extra blanket, shoes, and hair oil. Right before the closet on the left of it, and before the altar, is my tabla drums, replete with a hammer and a small bottle of talcum powder.\n\nThe walls are all white, except the back room, which is covered with a blue, mosaic-patterned cloth. The curtains over the large window are also white and see-through, which almost defeat the purpose of having them. The ceiling is white, but with black blotches above the meditation altar because of candle and incense smoke.\n\nIt is one of the coldest rooms in our house, as the windows are quite old and thin, and lack insulation. During autumn and winter, sometimes a heater is brought in to feel comfortable. However, with enough heavy blankets, sleep is manageable.\n\nIt is a simple room without much purpose other than sleeping, meditating, and playing percussion. But I am a down-to-earth person, and it matches what I need.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the six areas of brilliance that make a film great?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Though we might think that what makes a film great is subjective, there are definite criteria that points to it being a standout piece of art. There are tons of lists of the greatest films of all times, and what do they have in common? The six areas of brilliance are the script, characters, acting, timing, sound, and visuals (No Film School). In order for a film to be truly great, it needs to excel in all those spheres.\n\nFor scripts, if the dialog is clunky and unnatural, it is usually noticed by audiences and critics alike. No matter how amazing the plot is or how beautiful the visuals are, if the script is pretentious or awkward, then the film does not float. Also, having weak opening and/or ending dialog certainly contributes to a sour taste in the audience’s mouth (Grove, E.).\n\nCharacters are often the focal point of a film. They are the drivers of plot and scenes. The main aspect of characters in films that is important is whether or not they are believable. It is a fine balance between exaggeration of real life and vagueness (Nicholson, J.).\n\nIn order for a film to be great, the acting obviously has to be on par with the rest of its components. Critics usually go after actors whose work is flat, over the top, or unconvincing. It is part of the casting director’s job to find actors that will fit in the role perfectly, and that will act in a way that will be Oscar-worthy. This is perhaps the most difficult part of getting a film right, as it is the main characteristic of a film that people criticize, besides plot.\n\nThe timing, or a pace, of a film is often what keeps film viewers staying or leaving. A great film commonly slows down for emotional moments, and speeds up for action scenes—just like a novel does with its pacing. If a movie seems to take too long, or ends too swiftly, audience members usually feel that it either dragged on, or they did not get their money’s worth (raindance).\n\nSound is more essential to the film-viewing experience than most would believe. The sound, especially music, adds layers and emotional content to the film that nothing else can. A great film will have an impressive score, and one that aligns with the plot and mood of the film.\n\nFinally, the cinematography should be stunning. This part of film is often what makes A-list movies different than B-list movies. The type of camera used, the angles employed, the filters of the lens used, and much more add to the overall experience—which allows viewers to become engrossed in the film.\n\nThough most people say “to each one’s own” when it comes to films, there are exact criteria that critics and official film industry professionals use to gauge the greatness of films. These elements comprise script, characters, acting, timing, sound, and visuals. Without the successful undertaking of these aspects, a film might be a cult gaff, but never a cult classic.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the most impressive constructions of the ancient world?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Sometimes it may seem that historians already know everything possible about the ancient world. Indeed, scientists have found ways to glance at the very beginning of time, starting from the moment Earth appeared, through the age of bacteria, dinosaurs, primitive tribal societies, and until the most recent events. This does not mean there are no mysteries left, or no questions are unanswered, though. On the contrary, historians all over the world keep introducing theories explaining this or that historical phenomenon. And there are many of them in need of being explained: myths and legends such as the city of Atlantis, or why some figures on the Mayan and Aztec graves strongly resemble people in spacesuits, or speculations about how Stonehenge was built.\n\nIn fact, the latter—meaning ancient architecture in general—is often the subject of either debates or admiration (or both). Historians and archaeologists, mystics, and conspiracy theorists, adventurers and common people around the world all agree that raising some of the most impressive constructions such as the pyramids of Giza or Angkor Wat, using relatively simple tools and engineering methods, required enormous resources, effort, and technical wit, to say the least. Regarding the times they were built in, these constructions can be rightfully called wonders of the ancient world. Let us take a look at some of them.\n\nAny list of ancient wonders would not be full-fledged without the mention of Stonehenge—a gigantic ring of stones standing in the middle of Salisbury Plains in England. Being not the most beautiful wonder, Stonehenge still manages to inspire and impress; it is mostly its purpose and the way it was built, rather than its appearance, which intrigues. When it was first constructed, Stonehenge was a ring of huge megaliths standing on the ground, with another ring of megaliths on top of them; in other words, it was a structure of two circles, one lying upon the other. The construction is primitive, but the weight of some of the stones reaches 50 tons; the nearest quarry such stones could be extracted from is 18 miles away from the site. How did ancient people manage to transport megaliths? Why would they even want to do this, given that there was no dynamite, caterpillars, trucks, or other modern means of construction; respectively, transporting each megalith was a task of immense complication. There is evidence proving that works on the site where Stonehenge stands now started about 11,000 years ago, although the rocks were placed on their spots much later—only around 2,000 years B.C. The people who raised Stonehenge had no written language, their origins are unknown, as well as the purpose they worked on Stonehenge for such a long time. There are guesses that the stone rings were used for druid ceremonies, or as an ancient calendar, but an unequivocal explanation has not been provided yet (Unmuseum.org).\n\nAnother example of an ancient architectural wonder is the famous Great Wall of China. It is so enormous that it is probably the only human-made structure that can be seen from space (as they say), and that the extent of borders of some European countries would be less than the Wall’s overall length. To be more precise, the Wall is 13,170 miles long, and served as ancient China’s main protection against nomadic invasions from the West. In fact, it is so big that recently the Chinese government discovered that the Wall is even longer than it has been believed before. The process of the Wall’s construction took around 2,000 years: the project started around the 3rd century B.C., and continued until the 17th century. Built and expanded on from the third century B.C. until the seventeenth century A.D., obviously, it was not built as a single wall, meaning that different Chinese kingdoms (since China was not always a single state) in different periods of time raised different segments of the Wall. Many of its parts were reconstructed, so to the probable disappointment of some tourists, the Wall is not “original”—at least, not all of it; these “unoriginal” parts are exactly the segments open for tourists: Badaling, Juyongguan, Mutianyu, and Simatai. However, the Wall’s bigger part remains untouched and slowly degrades because of deterioration (Weather.com).\n\nSpeaking of Asia, it is always a source of exotic and mind-boggling wonders, which have remained unknown to the public for a long time. Perhaps everyone in the West knows about the pyramids of Giza, the Rhodes Colossus, the lighthouse of Alexandria, or the statue of Zeus. What people seldom know is that in Asia, there are lots of architectural wonders that are in no ways inferior to those located in the western hemisphere. For example, the gigantic statue of Buddha in Leshan: located in Sichuan, China. This is the largest statue of Buddha in the world, carved from stone. 71 meters high and 24 meters wide, the Leshan Buddha is impressive—not only because witnessing it makes you think about how the ancient sculptors managed to carve such a tremendous figure out of a cliff, but also because it emits calm and antiquity. Its construction started during the reign of the Tang dynasty (around 713 A.C.), and lasted for almost a century; the Leshan Buddha’s head is decorated with 1021 buns, and the drainage system it secretly utilizes reflects the engineering proficiency of those who raised the statue—this system helps keep the statue from deterioration, so this is one of the reasons why it is still standing there almost in its original magnificence (TMW).\n\nAs we can see, antiquity has a lot of surprises. The age of gigantic constructions and engineering wonders did not start with the first skyscrapers in the United States; thousands of years ago, people raised huge buildings, using primitive tools and methods that were available back then. However, wonders like Stonehenge, the Great Wall of China, or the Leshan Buddha prove there is no limit and no obstacle for human inspiration and innovation.###"}
{"prompt": "How did the royal lion hunt of Ashurbanipal influence Assyrian art?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The royal Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal is shown on a famous group of Assyrian palace reliefs from the North Palace of Nineveh that are now displayed in room 10a of the British Museum. They are widely regarded as “the supreme masterpieces of Assyrian art.”[1] They show a formalized ritual “hunt” by King Ashurbanipal (reigned 668 – c. 631/627 BC) in an arena, where captured Asian lions were released from cages for the king to slaughter with arrows, spears, or his sword.[2] They were made about 645–635 BC, and originally formed different sequences placed around the palace. They would probably originally have been painted, and formed part of a brightly colored overall decor.[3]\n\nThe slabs or orthostats from the North Palace were excavated by Hormuzd Rassam in 1852–54, and William Loftus in 1854–55. Most were sent back to the British Museum,[4] where they have been favorites with the general public and art historians alike ever since. The realism of the lions has always been praised, although the pathos modern viewers tend to feel was perhaps not part of the Assyrian response. The human figures are mostly seen in formal poses in profile, especially the king in his several appearances, but the lions are in a great variety of poses, alive, dying, and dead.[5]\n\nThe carvings come from late in the period of some 250 years over which Assyrian palace reliefs were made, and show the style at its most developed and finest,[6] before decline set in. Ashurbanipal was the last great Assyrian king, and after his reign ended the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the land descended into a period of poorly-recorded civil war between his descendants, generals, and rebelling parts of the empire. By 612, perhaps as little as 25 years after these were made, the empire had fallen apart and Nineveh been sacked and burnt.[7]\n\nFor over a millennium before these reliefs, it seems that the killing of lions was reserved in Mesopotamia for royalty, and kings were often shown in art doing so. There may have been a religious dimension to the activity. A surviving letter on a clay tablet records that when a lion entered a house in the provinces, it had to be trapped and taken by boat to the king. The Asian lion, today only surviving in a small population in India, is smaller than the African variety, and much later records show that their killing at close quarters, as depicted in the reliefs, is not an impossible feat. When the sword is used, it seems likely that, as in relatively recent times, the technique was that “the lion-killer wrapped his left arm in a huge quantity of goats’ hair yarn or tent-cloth” and tempted the lion to attack this, while the sword in the right hand dispatched him. This padded defense is never depicted.[8] More often, the king fires arrows at the lion; if these fail to stop him and he leaps, the huntsmen close beside the king use their spears.[9]\n\nAn earlier king, Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883-859), who had erected other lion hunt reliefs in his palace at Nimrud some 200 years before, boasted in inscriptions of about 865 BC that “the gods Ninurta and Nergal, who love my priesthood, gave me the wild animals of the plains, commanding me to hunt. 30 elephants I trapped and killed; 257 great wild oxen I brought down with my weapons, attacking from my chariot; 370 great lions I killed with hunting spears.”[10] Ashurnasirpal is shown shooting arrows at lions from his chariot, so perhaps this was a more conventional hunt in open country, or also in an arena.[11]\n\nIn the later reliefs, captured lions are released into an enclosed space, formed by soldiers making a shield-wall. Some are shown being released from wooden crates by an attendant in a smaller crate sitting on top, who lifts up a gate.[12] Despite hunting, lions survived in the wild in Mesopotamia until the 20th century.[13]\n\nThe lions may sometimes have been raised in captivity. Ashurnasirpal II, in an inscription boasting of his zoo, stated: “With my fierce heart, I captured 15 lions from the mountains and forests. I took away 50 lion cubs. I herded them into Kalhu (Nimrud) and the palaces of my land into cages. I bred their cubs in great numbers.”[14]\n\nThere are some two dozen sets of scenes of lion hunting in recorded Assyrian palace reliefs,[15] most giving the subject a much more brief treatment than here. Neo-Assyrian palaces were extensively decorated with such reliefs, carved in a low reliefs on slabs that are mostly of gypsum alabaster, which was plentiful in northern Iraq. Other animals were also shown being hunted, and the main subject for narrative reliefs was the war campaigns of the king who built the palace. Other reliefs showed the king, his court, and “winged genie” and lamassu protective minor deities.\n\nMost palace reliefs occupied the walls of large halls, with several rooms in sequence. But the lion hunt scenes in the North Palace come from more than one space; mostly from relatively-narrow passageways, leading off to larger rooms. They are not complete. Some also were originally on the upper floor, though they had fallen down to below ground level by the time they were excavated.[16] Their original setting was, in terms of dimensions, not that different to the way they are displayed today, though the ceiling would have been higher. The same palace has a much less usual relief with a male and female lion relaxing in a lush palace garden, the lioness snoozing, a “shady idyll” that perhaps represents palace pets, which we know lions sometimes were.[17]\n\nSome of the lion hunt reliefs occupy the whole height of the slab; like most narrative Assyrian reliefs, the scenes of military campaigns from the same palace are mostly divided into two horizontal registers.[18] The reliefs that came from the upper floor have scenes on three registers.[19] Ground-lines are clearly indicated, which is not always the case, and indeed some lions are given individual ground-lines when forming part of a larger scene. As well as the animals, depicted with “extraordinary subtlety of observation,”[20] the carving of the details of the king’s costume are especially fine.[21] At a late stage in their execution, the tails of nearly all the lions in the single register reliefs were shortened.[22]\n\nThe single register scenes show three large scenes from one side of a corridor. The arena of shields is shown, with a crowd of people either climbing a wooded hill for a good view, or getting away from this dangerous activity. At the top of the hill is a small building carrying a scene showing the king lion-hunting. The king makes ready in his chariot, the horses held by grooms. Huntsmen with large mastiff dogs and spears wait within the arena for any lion that comes too close to the shield-wall. In the large scene with the king hunting in his chariot, a total of 18 lions is shown, mostly dead or wounded. The other side of the corridor had similar scenes with the royal chariot in action shown twice.[23]\n\nAnother group of reliefs, some originally located on the upper floor and some in a small “private gate-chamber,”[24] are set out in three registers with a plain strip between them, with the figures much smaller. Some scenes are repeated, but not exactly, between the two groups. The lions released from cages charging at the king on foot are from here, and also the king pouring a libation onto the collected bodies of the dead lions. Some of this group are in Paris, and others were recorded in drawings but lost. These include scenes showing the king hunting lions and other animals in the wild; gazelles are beaten towards the king, hiding in a pit with bow and arrow.[25] In one scene, the same lion is shown three times close together: exiting his cage, charging towards the king, and leaping up at him, somewhat in the manner of a modern strip cartoon.[26]###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the attractions that Melbourne, Australia has to offer tourists?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Australia is probably one of the most mysterious regions of the world—at least for people who have never been there before. A huge continent on the outskirts of the world, a place where it is cold during summer months and warm when it is winter; a place whose inhabitants “walk upside down”; a place where flora and fauna is exotic, dangerous, and unique—many species inhabiting Australia cannot be found anywhere else in the world. Australia is well suited for living—and at the same time, there are regions where no human being has ever set foot before.\n\nAustralia can offer a traveler a lot to see, both in terms of wild nature and urban life. And, speaking of the latter, perhaps one of the most interesting places to visit is the city of Melbourne: the second largest city on the continent.\n\nMelbourne is located on the southeast part of Australia: at latitude 37 degrees 49 minutes south and longitude 144 degrees 58 minutes east. Melbourne’s metropolitan area covers 9990.5 square kilometers, and is inhabited by approximately 4.5 million people. The center of the city is represented by a business district; each of the other districts possesses its own purpose, functionality, character, communities living and working in them, and so on. Melbourne’s suburbs extend to more than 40 kilometers to the south of it. 30 kilometers to the east and 20 kilometers to the north lies the Dandenong Ranges National Park. To the west of Melbourne, vast basalt plains can be found. Annually, Melbourne is visited by over a million international visitors  (City of Melbourne).\n\nMelbourne is the capital of the state of Victoria, and was built on a coastal plain at the Port Phillip Bay, where the mouth of the Yarra River is located as well. Melbourne is considered Australia’s cultural center, and probably the most politically-conservative city in Australia. Walking around its streets, a tourist will eventually run into the buildings raised in Victorian style and modern high-tech skyscrapers; a number of art galleries, museums, and theaters; and extremely spacious parks and gardens. Melbourne hosts an enormous amount of all kinds of cultural (and not only cultural) events, and combined with an efficient transit system, it guarantees that a tourist will never feel the lack of action when staying in this city (melbourneaustralia.org).\n\nHalf a century ago, the American actress Ava Gardner who starred in the great 1960s movie “On the Beach” after Nevil Shute’s novel, proclaimed Melbourne to be the best place to film the end of the world. Presumably, there was not much to see in Melbourne back then, but since that time, a lot has changed, and now Melbourne is definitely one of the greatest and busiest cities on the planet. It can offer a tourist a number of attractions, arcades, places to eat and hang out at, as well as sporting facilities, including the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Flemington Racecourse; sometimes it seems that all the Melbourne’s townsmen are crazy about sports. Almost all of these attractions are located within the business center, or in its proximity—a walk or a short tram ride can deliver a tourist to any place worth visiting in Melbourne. Recently, the city’s docklands and the inner-city areas have been turned into residential areas, so now people of Melbourne can enjoy living in totally new districts (melbourne.com.au).\n\nAlong with the central districts, it is advisable to visit the Yarra River. Crossed with a number of bridges built in Victorian style, the river divides the city on the Central Business District and Southbank. There is much to see in this part of Melbourne: Royal Botanic Gardens, for example, or The Crown Entertainment Complex, which is the Southern Hemisphere’s biggest casino. To the south of the river, one can find a long (9 kilometers) green boulevard with English-style buildings along it: the St. Kilda Road. St. Kilda Bay, located at the end of the boulevard, once was a spooky place crowded by criminals, drug addicts, and prostitutes. But throughout the last 20 years, the Bay has turned into a remarkable and fashionable area with cake shops, boutiques, and other signs of civilization and well-being. To the north of the Central Business District, one can find Queen Victoria Market, Fitzroy Gardens, Flagstaff Gardens, and Treasury Gardens. Almost any place in Melbourne can be reached by a tram: the tramways system in the city is well organized and functions perfectly. There is even a restaurant on one of the city’s trams: it is an attraction for rich people (or at least for those who can afford paying $150-200 for food), but still a thing to see (melbourne.com.au).\n\nMelbourne is considered to be the cultural center of Australia. The majority of its theaters, museums, galleries, and other remarkable places are located in the city center, or the Central Business District. However, it does not mean there is not much to see in Melbourne beyond the central district. Redesigned and revived industrial and old city areas turned into residential districts, picturesque banks of the Yarra River, spacious gardens, and other places of interest combined with an extreme density of cultural events make Melbourne a great city to visit for any tourist.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the benefits of traditional Chinese medicine?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Chinese civilization has for thousands of years been one of the most advanced in the world. China is the land of grandiose architectural monuments, deeply-rooted traditions, unique philosophy and mysterious poetry, a diverse and difficult language, and an enigmatic mentality—a land of great accomplishments and terrible historical cataclysms. When speaking of China, one probably imagines Buddhist monks, temples in which students master the arts of peace and war, overpopulated megalopolises, exotic food, and incomprehensible (for a laowai: a foreigner) customs and lifestyle. But along with this, one of the most notable legacies of Chinese civilization is its traditional medicine.\n\nIt is not a secret that Chinese people live long—sometimes, incredibly long. If you have watched travel shows on Discovery or similar channels dedicated to China, you must have seen those old men and women, who, in their 80s or even 90s, look like a western person in their 60s. You must have also been amazed by how graciously and actively they move when doing physical exercises in open air—Chinese elderly people love them; it is called Tai Chi Quan, a mix of martial arts and gymnastics. Perhaps the question you kept asking yourself when seeing this was, “How? How is it possible that a person born somewhere in 1930s can look, move, and feel much younger that their age suggests?” One of the answers to this question is Chinese medicine.\n\nTo start with, Chinese medicine approaches health issues in a way different from what we have become accustomed to in the West. In particular, traditional Chinese medicine does not view body malfunctioning and diseases as separate, particular phenomenons, but rather as consistent patterns, legitimacies, which can be cured only through analyzing and treating a body as a holistic system, in which everything is interconnected. Therefore, Chinese medicine does not (or rarely) prescribe ailments for specific conditions, but focuses on treating the whole body instead. A big part of such approach belongs to the relationship between Yin and Yang—shortly put, two levels of energy flowing through everything that surrounds us. When there is harmony between these two flows of energy, a body is harmonious and healthy as well; when there is a imbalance, different kinds of maladies occur. Yin represents the feminine, “passive” energy, calm and gentle, whereas Yang comprises aggressiveness and hardness—features that men are usually imbued with (Taiwanese Secrets). The goal of treatment in Chinese medicine is to bring balance to the relationship between Yin and Yang.\n\nBased on such an approach, Chinese doctors have for thousands of years developed their arts of therapy and treatment. China’s traditional medicine widely utilizes methods that are considered unconventional in the West, but which have nevertheless been proven in their efficiency. Along with Qi-gong, Tai Chi, or Wushu, all of which are closely related to manipulating energies, Chinese medicine also relies on herbs, acupuncture, and massage. However, as it often occurs in Asia, it is not all that simple.\n\nHerbal therapy is probably among the most-commonly used types of therapy in China. It focuses on both treating a disease, and preventing it from occurring again in the future. There are 5,767 medicinal substances used by Chinese traditional medicine at the moment, and not all of them are herbs: a person undergoing such therapy may encounter rather exotic ingredients from which the ailments are made, such as insects, animal genitals, tiger claws, and so on. There are also several forms in which medicine can be made: 1) herbal decoctions, which are the most traditional and “acceptable” to the western mind. These decoctions can take a long time to make, and are famous (or better said, infamous) for their strong scent and taste; 2) herbal powders, from which, with the addition of water, the aforementioned “teas” can be made. Since they possess a weaker aroma and taste better, they are more popular in the West as compared to decoctions; 3) syrups, which are mostly used to treat children from light illnesses, such as cough, common cold, and sore throat; 4) liniments, compressors, and plasters applied externally. All of these, as well as other methods, are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine both inside and outside China (University of Minnesota). However, perhaps only in China you will be able to find the most efficient and exotic ailments, since some ingredients for them cannot be found outside of this country.\n\nMassage is yet another common method of treatment widely used in Chinese medicine. The type of massage described below originates from Taiwan, and is called the Taiwanese knife massage. It dates back over 2000 years, and in other places outside of Taiwan, it has completely disappeared. As exotic as it sounds, the knife massage is also claimed to be more effective than more conventional massage techniques. These special knives are believed to penetrate muscles more deeply than in other methods, resulting in more noticeable positive health effects. The knives used for this type of massage are not regular meat cleavers—they are made specifically for masseurs, and are unlikely to cut a patient’s skin. Besides, the massage is performed through a towel, so the risks are minimal. Currently, there are about 2000 masseurs specializing in this type of massage. These days, there are around 2000 knife therapists in China, all of them living strict and disciplined lives, following special vegetarian diets, and practicing their art regularly (Skyscanner).\n\nYet another technique used throughout Asia for therapy and malady prevention is acupuncture, and China is the land in which the art of acupuncture had emerged and reached its climax. The first records mentioning acupuncture originated from approximately 1600 B.C., most of them being carvings made on bones, such as turtle-shells. Ancient acupuncture needles were made of stone, and were used to make skin incisions and stimulate specific points in the human body; it was believed Qi energy (or vital energy) could not flow freely through these points if they were functioning improperly, and acupuncture was supposed to break such “blocks” and let Qi flow naturally (British Acupuncture Council). Later, needles for acupuncture were made from bamboo (acos.rog). Acupuncturists are knowledgeable in using secret diagnostic techniques, and focus rather on a patient than on his or her sickness or symptoms (applying the aforementioned holistic approach). Each patient is seen as unique, and even if they possess the same diagnosis, the treatment may differ; two people with the same western diagnosis may well receive different acupuncture treatments (British Acupuncture Council).\n\nAs it can be seen, traditional Chinese medicine is as enigmatic and complex as Chinese culture. Based on principles alien to western conventional medicine, the oriental approach to therapy and treatment has been nevertheless proven to be efficient throughout centuries. Focusing on the relationship between Yin and Yang, on the flow of the vital Qi energy through a human body, Chinese therapists use a variety of methods to return a human body to healthy functioning, such as herbal decoctions, secret massage techniques, and the ancient art of acupuncture. Perhaps, people in the West should not neglect the effectiveness of Chinese medicine just because it does not use MRI scanners and modern diagnostics, and put more trust in the millenary traditions of Chinese people.###"}
{"prompt": "How do you define a point in space and a point in time?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Center-of-mass motion in one dimension is particularly easy to deal with because all the information about it can be encapsulated in two variables: xx, the position of the center of mass relative to the origin, and tt, which measures a point in time. For instance, if someone supplied you with a sufficiently detailed table of xx and tt values, you would know pretty much all there was to know about the motion of the object’s center of mass.\n\nIn ordinary speech, we use the word “time” in two different senses, which are to be distinguished in physics. It can be used, as in “a short time” or “our time here on Earth,” to mean a length or duration of time, or it can be used to indicate a clock reading, as in “I did not know what time it was,” or “now is the time.” In symbols, tt is ordinarily used to mean a point in time, while ΔtΔt signifies an interval or duration in time. The capital Greek letter delta, ΔΔ, means “the change in…,” i.e. a duration in time is the change or difference between one clock reading and another. The notation ΔtΔt does not signify the product of two numbers, ΔΔ and tt, but rather one single number, ΔtΔt. If a matinee begins at a point in time t=1t=1 o’clock and ends at t=3t=3 o’clock, the duration of the movie was the change in tt,\n\nΔt=3 hours−1 hour= 2 hours.\nΔt=3 hours−1 hour= 2 hours.\n\nTo avoid the use of negative numbers for ΔtΔt, we write the clock reading “after” to the left of the minus sign, and the clock reading “before” to the right of the minus sign. A more specific definition of the delta notation is therefore that delta stands for “after minus before.”\n\nEven though our definition of the delta notation guarantees that ΔtΔt is positive, there is no reason why tt cannot be negative. If tt could not be negative, what would have happened one second before t=0?t=0? That does not mean that time “goes backward” in the sense that adults can shrink into infants and retreat into the womb. It just means that we have to pick a reference point and call it t=0t=0, and then times before that are represented by negative values of tt. An example is that a year like 2007 A.D. can be thought of as a positive tt value, while one like 370 B.C. is negative. Similarly, when you hear a countdown for a rocket launch, the phrase “t minus ten seconds” is a way of saying t=−10 st=−10 s, where t=0t=0 is the time of blastoff, and t>0t>0 refers to times after launch.\n\nAlthough a point in time can be thought of as a clock reading, it is usually a good idea to avoid doing computations with expressions such as “2:35” that are combinations of hours and minutes. Times can instead be expressed entirely in terms of a single unit, such as hours. Fractions of an hour can be represented by decimals rather than minutes, and similarly if a problem is being worked in terms of minutes, decimals can be used instead of seconds.\n\nAs with time, a distinction should be made between a point in space, symbolized as a coordinate xx, and a change in position, symbolized as ΔxΔx.\n\nAs with t, xt, x can be negative. If a train is moving down the tracks, not only do you have the freedom to choose any point along the tracks and call it x=0x=0, but it is also up to you to decide which side of the x=0x=0 point is positive xx and which side is negative xx.\n\nSince we have defined the delta notation to mean “after minus before,” it is possible that ΔxΔx will be negative, unlike ΔtΔt, which is guaranteed to be positive. Suppose we are describing the motion of a train on tracks linking Tucson and Chicago. As shown in the figure, it is entirely up to you to decide which way is positive.\n\nNote that in addition to xx and ΔxΔx, there is a third quantity we could define, which would be like an odometer reading, or actual distance traveled. If you drive 10 miles, make a U-turn, and drive back 10 miles, then your ΔxΔx is zero, but your car’s odometer reading has increased by 20 miles. However important the odometer reading is to car owners and used car dealers, it is not important in physics, and there is not even a standard name or notation for it. The change in position, ΔxΔx, is more useful because it is so much easier to calculate: to compute ΔxΔx, we only need to know the beginning and ending positions of the object, not all the information about how it got from one position to the other.\n\nThe example above shows there are two arbitrary choices you have to make in order to define a position variable, xx. You have to decide where to put x=0x=0, and also which direction will be positive. This is referred to as choosing a coordinate system or choosing a frame of reference (the two terms are nearly synonymous, but the first focuses more on the actual xx variable, while the second is more of a general way of referring to one’s point of view). As long as you are consistent, any frame is equally valid. You just do not want to change coordinate systems in the middle of a calculation.\n\nHave you ever been sitting in a train in a station when suddenly you notice the station is moving backward? Most people would describe the situation by saying that you just failed to notice that the train was moving—it only seemed like the station was moving. But this shows there is yet a third arbitrary choice that goes into choosing a coordinate system: valid frames of reference can differ from each other by moving relative to one another. It might seem strange that anyone would bother with a coordinate system that was moving relative to Earth, but for instance the frame of reference moving along with a train might be far more convenient for describing things happening inside the train.###"}
{"prompt": "How does the center of mass affect the motion of an object?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If you had to think consciously in order to move your body, you would be severely disabled. Even walking, which we consider to be no great feat, requires an intricate series of motions your cerebrum would be utterly incapable of coordinating. The task of putting one foot in front of the other is controlled by the more primitive parts of your brain, the ones that have not changed much since the mammals and reptiles went their separate evolutionary ways. The thinking part of your brain limits itself to general directives such as “walk faster,” or “don’t step on her toes,” rather than micromanaging every contraction and relaxation of the hundred or so muscles of your hips, legs, and feet.\n\nPhysics is all about the conscious understanding of motion, but we are obviously not immediately prepared to understand the most complicated types of motion. Instead, we will use the divide-and-conquer technique. We will first classify the various types of motion, and then begin our campaign with an attack on the simplest cases. To make it clear what we are and are not ready to consider, we need to examine and define carefully what types of motion can exist.\n\nNobody, with the possible exception of Fred Astaire, can simply glide forward without bending their joints. Walking is thus an example in which there is both a general motion of the whole object and a change in the shape of the object. Another example is the motion of a jiggling water balloon as it flies through the air. We are not presently attempting a mathematical description of the way in which the shape of an object changes. Motion without a change in shape is called rigid-body motion (the word “body” is often used in physics as a synonym for “object”).\n\nA ballerina leaps into the air and spins around once before landing. We feel intuitively that her rigid-body motion while her feet are off the ground consists of two kinds of motion going on simultaneously: a rotation and a motion of her body as a whole through space, along an arc. It is not immediately obvious, however, what is the most useful way to define the distinction between rotation and motion through space. Imagine you attempt to balance a chair and it falls over. One person might say that the only motion was a rotation about the chair’s point of contact with the floor, but another might say there was both rotation and motion down and to the side.\n\nIt turns out there is one particularly natural and useful way to make a clear definition, but it requires a brief digression. Every object has a balance point, referred to in physics as the center of mass. For a two-dimensional object such as a cardboard cutout, the center of mass is the point at which you could hang the object from a string and make it balance. In the case of the ballerina (who is likely to be three-dimensional unless her diet is particularly severe), it might be a point either inside or outside her body, depending on how she holds her arms. Even if it is not practical to attach a string to the balance point itself, the center of mass can be defined.\n\nWhy is the center of mass concept relevant to the question of classifying rotational motion as opposed to motion through space? It turns out that the motion of an object’s center of mass is nearly always far simpler than the motion of any other part of the object. The ballerina’s body is a large object with a complex shape. We might expect that her motion would be much more complicated than the motion of a small, simply-shaped object, say a marble, thrown up at the same angle as the angle at which she leapt. But it turns out that the motion of the ballerina’s center of mass is exactly the same as the motion of the marble. That is, the motion of the center of mass is the same as the motion the ballerina would have if all her mass was concentrated at a point. By restricting our attention to the motion of the center of mass, we can therefore simplify things greatly.\n\nWe can now replace the ambiguous idea of “motion as a whole through space” with the more useful and better defined concept of “center-of-mass motion.” The motion of any rigid body can be cleanly split into rotation and center-of-mass motion. By this definition, the tipping chair does have both rotational and center-of-mass motion. Concentrating on the center of mass motion allows us to make a simplified model of the motion, as if a complicated object like a human body was just a marble or a point-like particle. Science really never deals with reality; it deals with models of reality.\n\nNote that the word “center” in “center of mass” is not meant to imply that the center of mass must lie at the geometrical center of an object. A car wheel that has not been balanced properly has a center of mass that does not coincide with its geometrical center. An object such as the human body does not even have an obvious geometrical center.\n\nIt can be helpful to think of the center of mass as the average location of all the mass in the object. With this interpretation, we can see for example that raising your arms above your head raises your center of mass, since the higher position of the arms’ mass raises the average.\njete-illusion\n\nBallerinas and professional basketball players can create an illusion of flying horizontally through the air because our brains intuitively expect them to have rigid-body motion, but the body does not stay rigid while executing a grand jete or a slam dunk. The legs are low at the beginning and end of the jump, but come up higher at the middle. Regardless of what the limbs do, the center of mass will follow the same arc, but the low position of the legs at the beginning and end means the torso is higher compared to the center of mass, while in the middle of the jump it is lower compared to the center of mass. Our eye follows the motion of the torso and tries to interpret it as the center-of-mass motion of a rigid body. But since the torso follows a path flatter than we expect, this attempted interpretation fails, and we experience an illusion that the person is flying horizontally.\n\nIn addition, there are cases in which the center of mass moves along a straight line, such as objects falling straight down, or a car that speeds up and slows down but does not turn.\n\nNote that even though we are not explicitly studying the more complex aspects of motion, we can still analyze the center-of-mass motion while ignoring other types of motion that might be occurring simultaneously. For instance, if a cat is falling out of a tree and is initially upside-down, it goes through a series of contortions that bring its feet under it. This is definitely not an example of rigid-body motion, but we can still analyze the motion of the cat’s center of mass just as we would for a dropping rock.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the scientific method?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If you drop your shoe and a coin side by side, they hit the ground at the same time. Why does not the shoe get there first, since gravity is pulling harder on it? How does the lens of your eye work, and why do your eye’s muscles need to squash its lens into different shapes in order to focus on objects nearby or far away? These are the kinds of questions that physics tries to answer about the behavior of light and matter, the two things that the universe is made of.\n\nUntil very recently in history, no progress was made in answering questions like these. Worse than that, the wrong answers written by thinkers like the ancient Greek physicist Aristotle were accepted without question for thousands of years. Why is it that scientific knowledge has progressed more since the Renaissance than it had in all the preceding millennia since the beginning of recorded history? Undoubtedly the industrial revolution is part of the answer. Building its centerpiece, the steam engine, required improved techniques for precise construction and measurement (early on, it was considered a major advance when English machine shops learned to build pistons and cylinders that fit together with a gap narrower than the thickness of a penny). But even before the industrial revolution, the pace of discovery had picked up, mainly because of the introduction of the modern scientific method. Although it evolved over time, most scientists today would agree on something like the following list of the basic principles of the scientific method:\n\nScientific theories are created to explain the results of experiments that were created under certain conditions. A successful theory will also make new predictions about new experiments under new conditions. Eventually, though, it always seems to happen that a new experiment comes along, showing that under certain conditions the theory is not a good approximation or is not valid at all. The ball is then back in the theorists’ court. If an experiment disagrees with the current theory, the theory has to be changed, not the experiment.\n\nThe requirement of predictive power means that a theory is only meaningful if it predicts something that can be checked against experimental measurements the theorist did not already have at hand. That is, a theory should be testable. Explanatory value means that many phenomena should be accounted for with few basic principles. If you answer every “why” question with “because that’s the way it is,” then your theory has no explanatory value. Collecting lots of data without being able to find any basic underlying principles is not science.\n\nAn experiment should be treated with suspicion if it only works for one person, or only in one part of the world. Anyone with the necessary skills and equipment should be able to get the same results from the same experiment. This implies that science transcends national and ethnic boundaries; you can be sure that nobody is doing actual science who claims that their work is “Aryan, not Jewish,” “Marxist, not bourgeois,” or “Christian, not atheistic.” An experiment cannot be reproduced if it is secret, so science is necessarily a public enterprise.\n\nAs an example of the cycle of theory and experiment, a vital step toward modern chemistry was the experimental observation that the chemical elements could not be transformed into each other, e.g., lead could not be turned into gold. This led to the theory that chemical reactions consisted of rearrangements of the elements in different combinations, without any change in the identities of the elements themselves. The theory worked for hundreds of years, and was confirmed experimentally over a wide range of pressures and temperatures and with many combinations of elements. Only in the twentieth century did we learn that one element could be trans-formed into one another under the conditions of extremely high pressure and temperature existing in a nuclear bomb or inside a star. That observation did not completely invalidate the original theory of the immutability of the elements, but it showed that it was only an approximation, valid at ordinary temperatures and pressures.\n\nThe scientific method as described here is an idealization, and should not be understood as a set procedure for doing science. Scientists have as many weaknesses and character flaws as any other group, and it is common for scientists to try to discredit other people’s experiments when the results run contrary to their own favored point of view. Successful science also has more to do with luck, intuition, and creativity than most people realize, and the restrictions of the scientific method do not stifle individuality and self-expression any more than the fugue and sonata forms stifled Bach and Haydn. There is a recent tendency among social scientists to go even further and to deny that the scientific method even exists, claiming that science is no more than an arbitrary social system that determines what ideas to accept based on an in-group’s criteria. I think that is going too far. If science is an arbitrary social ritual, it would seem difficult to explain its effectiveness in building such useful items as airplanes, CD players, and sewers. If alchemy and astrology were no less scientific in their methods than chemistry and astronomy, what was it that kept them from producing anything useful?###"}
{"prompt": "What is the most difficult part of crossing a desert?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " It is difficult to form a correct idea of a desert without having seen one. It is a vast plain of sands and stones, interspersed with mountains of various sizes and heights, usually without roads or shelters. They sometimes have springs of water, which burst forth, and create verdant spots.\n\nThe most remarkable of deserts is the Sahara. This is a vast plain, but a little elevated above the level of the ocean, and covered with sand and gravel, with a mixture of sea shells, and appears like the basin of an evaporated sea.\n\nAmid the desert, there are springs of water which burst forth and create verdant spots, called oases. There are thirty-two of these that contain fountains, and date and palm trees; twenty of them are inhabited. They serve as stopping places for the caravans, and often contain villages.\n\nWere it not for these, no human being could cross this waste of burning sand. So violent, sometimes, is the burning wind that the scorching heat dries up the water of these springs, and then frequently, the most disastrous consequences follow.\n\nIn 1805, a caravan consisting of 2,000 persons and 1,800 camels, not finding water at the usual resting place, died of thirst, both men and animals. Storms of wind are more terrible in this desert than on the ocean. Vast surges and clouds of red sand are raised and rolled forward, burying everything in its way, and it is said that whole tribes have thus been swallowed up.\n\nThe situation of such is dreadful, and admits of no resource.

It is then that the value of a cup of water is truly felt.\n\nTo be thirsty in a desert, without water, exposed to the burning sun, without shelter, is the most terrible situation that a human being can be placed in, and one of the greatest sufferings that a human being can sustain; the tongue and lips swell; a hollow sound is heard in the ears, which brings on deafness, and the brain appears to grow thick and inflamed.\n\nIf, unfortunately, any one falls sick on the road, he or she must either endure the fatigue of traveling on a camel, (which is troublesome even to healthy people,) or he or she must be left behind on the sand, without any assistance, and remain so until a slow death comes to relieve him or her.###"}

As the aging author rode a nag on the road to Toledo, a student catching up to him from behind hailed him with these words, “Yes, yes, this is the complete cripple, the completely famous and comic writer, and lastly, the delight of the muses!” Cervantes could not accept this faint praise, and replied, “That is an error into which many of my uninformed admirers have fallen. I, sir, am Cervantes, but not the delight of the muses or any of the other foolish things that you have mentioned.” Cervantes finished the prologue by taking leave of his readers: “for I am dying and hope to see you soon, happy in the life to come!”1\n\nThe literary fame Cervantes gained in his lifetime was for writing Don Quixote de la Mancha. The book tells the story of Alonso Quijano, a country gentleman whose limited estate had been eaten away by his purse and mental stability, caused by his non-stop consumption of chivalric romance. Proclaiming himself the knight errant Don Quixote de la Mancha, in an age when they no longer exist, he sets off, accompanied by the peasant Sancho Panza, to right imaginary wrongs, only to meet with beatings by those who considered him at best a madman, if not a fool. After being taken home in a cage by his neighbors at the end of Part One, Don Quixote hits the road again in Part Two, this time to encounter readers of his previous misadventures, including a Duke and Duchess who turn the would-be knight errant and squire into court entertainment.\n\nPublished in 1605, Part One gained sufficient popularity to inspire a translation into English by Thomas Shelton, probably by 1612, and into French by Cesar Oudin by 1614, as well as a spurious continuation from 1614 by the pseudonymous Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda. Already having begun Part Two (published in 1615), Cervantes reacted against Avellaneda’s sequel by changing his characters’ route and taking angry swipes at the impostor. Nonetheless, the generic identity and even the intent behind his beloved work had bothered the author from the beginning. In Part One’s prologue, an unnamed friend advises Cervantes, who struggles with writer’s block, that his goal be “demolishing the ill-founded apparatus of these chivalric books, despised by many and praised by so many more, and if you accomplish this, you will have accomplished much.” What is more, reading Don Quixote was to “move the melancholy to laughter, increase the joy of the cheerful, not irritate the simple, fill the clever with admiration for its invention, not give the serious reason to scorn it, and allow the prudent to praise it.”2\n\nWhatever Cervantes’ initial idea, in the course of the last 400 years, Don Quixote has embarked on a journey in the world imagination that has taken the literary character far beyond its original conception. The book illustrations of Cervantes’ Don Quixote would play a decisive role in this—transforming not only the image of Don Quixote and his loyal servant Sancho Panza, but also by giving life to the image of Cervantes himself.\n\nSeventeenth-century images emphasized the title character’s pompous folly as well as the often rough-and-tumble action of many episodes. The windmill scene, in which Don Quixote mistakes the technology that grinds the grain produced in the semi-arid Manchegan landscape for giants, became immediately iconic. The first representation of the scene appears in a Frankfurt edition of 1648, in which the windmill sail stabs Don Quixote.\n\nThe frontispiece to the 1687 London Hodgkin edition also captures important motifs of early visual interpretation. The presence of the windmill identifies this otherwise English countryside as the setting for Don Quixote’s adventures, as it already did in the title page to the 1620 London Blount edition. In the foreground, Don Quixote proudly wears the basin that he has claimed from a bewildered barber as Mambrino’s helmet, while Sancho, dominated by a beer belly, wears a dunce’s cap. Aldonza Lorenzo, the peasant Don Quixote names as his sweetheart when Sancho pushes for information about the imaginary Dulcinea, feeds pigs in the background.\n\nThe iconographic tradition has already diverged from the novel in significant ways. In the text, Sancho is described as having long shanks, but illustrators show him with the abundant belly that is his name implies (Panza meaning “belly” in Spanish). The comic opposition of the short, fat peasant to the tall, lean would-be knight errant—a juxtaposition never developed by Cervantes—emerges early in book illustrations. Here the fictitious nature of the beautiful, virginal Dulcinea stressed by Cervantes remains unchanged, as the illustrator depicts Cervantes’ joke concerning a husky peasant woman who had the best hand for salting pork in all the neighboring countryside.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, major changes came to the interpretation of Don Quixote, accompanied by a reappraisal of Cervantes. The advent of deluxe editions containing biographies of the author as well as abundant engravings, including illustrations of the episodes with allegorical frontispieces and maps, transformed the funny book into a monumental tome fit to take its place beside classics such as Homer, Dante, and Horace on the learned reader’s bookshelf.\n\nThe 1738 London Tonson edition, published in Spanish and patronized by Lord Carteret, constitutes a monumental project. It boasts Gregorio Mayans y Siscar’s biography of Cervantes as well as two portraits of Cervantes, one presenting him as a sensitive man of letters and another as the allegorical hero Hercules Musagetes. The first, designed by William Kent and engraved by George Vertue, emphasizes the writer’s dignity, hiding the hand maimed at the Battle of Lepanto and framing him in drapery and books in a Gothic architectural setting. Cervantes clearly controls his characters, Don Quixote and Sancho, astride their mounts in a vaulted niche behind him.\n\nThe allegorical portrait of Cervantes, designed by John Vanderbank and engraved by Gerard van der Gucht, as a muscular Hercules, stands in sharp contrast. The author turns his back on the viewer and the pleading Muses, takes a club and a mask from a beckoning satyr, and strides toward Mount Parnassus to rid it of the monsters of knight errantry that occupy it.\n\nThe meaning of the illustrations must have seemed somewhat slippery and unstable, for a certain Dr. John Oldfield found it necessary to write accompanying explanations. The mask, which sports a heavy brow and craggy nose similar to that of Don Quixote in the editions episodic illustrations, is “the proper implement for accomplishing [Cervantes’] end, viz. those of raillery and satire.”3 Whereas earlier commentators insisted on Cervantes’ parody of the popular literature of knight errantry, Oldfield and Mayans now attribute to the author satiric intent, clothing him in neo-classical attire. For Mayans, the literature of knight errantry is nothing less than barbaric, perpetuating the rule of brute power that followed the fall of Rome. Cervantes’ satirical attack on chivalric romance becomes, then, a defense of reason and, even, civilization.\n\nIn visual terms, elevating the novel to another genre translates to illustrating episodes that show Don Quixote not only as a fool, but also as a man of learning. In this sense, alternative narratives emerge in the illustrations. For example, Cervantes pokes fun at Don Quixote as his character discourses—before puzzled, illiterate goatherds—on the lost Golden Age when trees gave freely of their fruit and maidens rode untouched across the wilderness as virginal as the mothers who gave them birth. Not only does the would-be knight-errant mangle the classical topic, but he does so for an audience who has no idea what he is talking about. When Vanderbank encapsulates this episode in its climactic moment according to the norms of history painting, a starkly different vision emerges.\n\nThe goatherds listen raptly as a youth presents his muscular back to the spectator, but turns his head in respectful attention toward the distinguished Don Quixote. This setting of the central character, using the surrounding crowd to pull in the viewer’s eye, is seen in works such as Velázquez’s The Surrender of Breda. Indeed, the only person who ignores Cervantes’ madman is Sancho, who guzzles his wine bottom right. The visual neoclassical vocabulary fails to capture Cervantes’ irony, nor is it deemed fitting within the larger project of canonizing the novel Don Quixote to revert to depicting scenes of physical humor or of Don Quixote’s madness. In fact, this edition does not depict the infamous windmill scene at all.\n\nAlthough the 1780 Madrid Ibarra edition, patronized by the Real Academia de la Lengua, complements the 1738 London Tonson edition in its canonizing impulse, certain components demonstrate how the language of neoclassicism, both visual and critical, can give way to a sentimental reading of the novel in which Don Quixote emerges as a hero. In his analysis of the novel, Vicente de los Ríos notes glimpses of wisdom within the character of Don Quixote, and observes that when not dealing with issues of knight errantry, the madman always behaves as an educated gentleman. Among the several illustrators whose drawings were engraved for this monumental edition, José del Castillo ventured into a heroic vocabulary. In an illustration of Don Quixote’s beating by mare herders engraved by Pedro Pascual Moles, Castillo grants the fallen character dignity and strength, as he offsets the brutish beating by the two peasants with his outstretched shield.\n\nHis profile is strong, middle-aged, and handsome—his gaze valiant. Even the compositional curve formed by his attackers and the tree behind them is anchored by the firm Don Quixote at their feet. All this, of course, illustrates a violent encounter occasioned by an event perhaps more comic than dignified: the randy nag Rocinante’s unwelcome sexual advances upon the mares.\n\nWith the advent of mass-produced editions containing vignettes and full-page illustrations in the nineteenth century, comic and sentimental images often coexisted in the same volume. In the 1818 London Cadell edition, Robert Smirke designed two quite different illustrations, both referring to Don Quixote’s penance in the Sierra Morena, in which the would-be knight errant took off his pants and performed acrobatic feats as proof of his devotion to Dulcinea. One is a full-page illustration, engraved by Francis Engleheart, showing Don Quixote seated half-naked atop a mountain peak, which has been interpreted as evidence of a “Romantic” reading of the novel.\n\nThe other illustration, an accompanying vignette, clearly participates in the older, comic tradition as it shows Don Quixote upside-down with bare legs akimbo and Sancho Panza in the background, aghast at his master´s shamelessness.\n\nThe production of vignettes along with full-paged illustrations (already seen in deluxe editions) allows for a multiplicity of visual interpretations of Don Quixote side by side in the same edition.\n\nIn his illustrations for the 1863 Paris Hachette edition, Gustave Doré took advantage of the diversity of the iconographic traditions to create a visually-exuberant and even contradictory vision of Cervantes’ novel. The French illustrator carried the sentimental tradition to its extreme, seeing not only Don Quixote as the hero he believed himself to be, but also seeing the world from his perspective. Granted new technical capacity to explore dark tones through wood engraving, Doré reveled in depicting night scenes, wringing from them their lugubrious ambient qualities. In the illustration engraved by Longacre after Doré’s drawing of a fictitious procession of “Merlin,” rigged by a duke and duchess to manipulate Don Quixote and Sancho, the artist capitalizes on white-on-black delineation to highlight the spectral quality the midnight scene would have had for the two frightened protagonists.\n\nThis vision of the episode allows readers to experience the knight errant and squire’s fear, and then to feel the disappointment and eventual loathing for the cynical aristocracy as the truth is revealed. This inversion of perspectives is another turn in the visual narrative. Nonetheless, Doré did not renounce the comic. Returning to the windmill scene, Doré foregrounds Don Quixote’s defeat as the tattered sail sweeps Rocinante into the air, exposing the horse’s underbelly and the thwarted madman in a great arc that brings the vision of a battle between a hero and giants down to earth.\n\nIn the case of eighteenth-century deluxe editions, the move by publishers and literary biographers to canonize Cervantes and his novel was coupled with the illustrators’ neoclassical visual vocabulary that tended toward sentimentalizing Don Quixote. As editorial projects, these editions were monumental in scale and succeeded in envisioning Cervantes as a “classical” author, yet the illustrations depict an intentionally one-sided perspective on the novel’s complexity, sacrificing its humor and irony. Nineteenth-century editions, cheaply produced and including vignettes, reintroduced the comic episodes side-by-side with the sentimental. Even more influential was making the perspective of Don Quixote himself visible, in all its excessive attractiveness, as seen in Doré’s vision. So, it is that the character Don Quixote slipped away from the straitjacket in which he had been held when considered a mere tool for attacking chivalric romances, and became a hero of the popular imagination. Cervantes had already glimpsed how slippery the claims to his wonderful nutcase would be, when in the Prologue to Part I he quipped, “But though I seem to be the father, I am the stepfather of Don Quixote.”4###"}
{"prompt": "What is the most expensive photo ever taken?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A long time has passed since photography was used to only record memorable events, and transformed into one of the most popular forms of visual art. And, as well as other forms of contemporary art nowadays, photography can be expensive to purchase, especially if it was taken by a famous photographer, and corresponds with the latest art trends. For now, the most expensive photo ever taken was estimated at 4.3 million dollars, in 1999, and was created by the German photographer Andreas Gursky. The photograph is named Rhein II, and apart from its incredible cost, it is a truly remarkable piece of contemporary art.\n\nWhen looking at the photo, a spectator sees six stripes of grayish blue, green, and grey. From a certain distance, the photo might look like a painting of an abstractionist artist, something that perhaps Malevich or Rothko would paint; however, as you take a closer look, you can notice that the stripes are actually a sky, a river, grass, and asphalt. First comes the grayish-blue sky; after it, there is a narrow stripe of a farther shore, the river Rhine, and a green piece of a closer shore of the river, divided into two by the grey stripe of the asphalt track.\n\nThe size of the photograph is impressive: 73 x 143 inches, with an even larger frame around it; the photo is printed on acrylic glass. In 2011, it was sold to an anonymous buyer at Christie’s New York auction for the price of $4,338,500, which has made Rhein II the most expensive photograph ever sold.\n\nIt is interesting that the image on the photo is not how Rhine looks like in real life, or how it looked back in 1999, when Gursky took the photo. Gursky had to heavily retouch Rhein II using digital editing in various image processing programs; originally, the photo contained many superfluous details, such as people walking around the scene, buildings across the river, and so on. “Paradoxically, this view of the Rhine cannot be obtained in situ—a fictitious construction was required to provide an accurate image of a modern river,” said Andreas Gursky.\n\nFor those who do not value contemporary art much, Rhein II might seem like a regular photo; however, there are experts who can adequately estimate a piece of art, and are ready and willing to pay huge amounts of money to own it. This photo taken by Andreas Gursky is proof of it.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the Empire State Building?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The United States was the first country to build skyscrapers. The amazing technology used to raise buildings that seemed to touch the sky has developed and improved, and now incredible skyscrapers of all shapes and configurations are one of America’s visit cards. However, there is one iconic building which, despite it being built almost a century ago, still remains one of America’s symbols. This is the Empire State Building.\n\nBuilt in 1931, this skyscraper counts 102 floors, and its height is 1454 feet. Located in Manhattan, it occupies an area of around 208,879 m². Surprisingly, considering its size, the Empire State Building was raised only in 410 days with the effort of approximately 3,400 construction workers. What is even more surprising is that the skyscraper did not cost much to build (in relative prices); including the price of land, the estimated price of the project was $40,948,000—not too much for such a gigantic building even at those times, with the cost of the building itself only being $24,718,000.\n\nThe skyscraper is built in the architectural art deco style. This style was typical for the America of the 1930s, and the Empire State Building is a classical representative of this style, with all of its geometric forms, symmetrical patterns, and vivid, contrasted colors. The materials used in construction were also typical for art deco: steel, aluminium, granite, limestone, and concrete. Perhaps the most outstanding part of the building is its antenna of an unusual shape; it performs not only a decorative function, but also protects the building, serving as a lightning rod: annually, it is struck by lightning 23 times on average. It is said that the skyscraper’s developer, John Jakob Raskob, got the idea of a future building after pulling a pencil from his drawer. He held it up to the architect, William Lamb, and asked him, “Bill, how tall can you make it so that it won’t fall down?”\n\nThe Empire State Building was made from the most up-to-date construction technologies of its day. For example, for the skyscraper’s foundation, a substantial concrete base was used, which allowed to support the enormous weight of the steel framework of the building. For a framework, prefabricated steel sections was used; they were manufactured to exact sizes (within 2mm tolerance) and could be either bolted together, or joined with rivets. In particular, the hot riveting technique was borrowed from the shipbuilding industry, where it was used to join ships’ steel plates together. In the case of the Empire State Building, a steel rivet (yet plain) was first heated up to the maximum possible temperature, and then passed through the holes of steel sections that needed to be fastened. Through heating up, construction workers made rivets soft, and after passing them through holes, they had to use a rivet gun in order to make a rivet’s plain end round, and thus seal steel girders together. The resulted construction was incredibly strong; in July 1945, a B-25 bomber crashed into the Empire State Building’s 79th floor, however it reopened in only two days.\n\nThe Empire State Building is truly a magnificent example of architectural style, engineering genius, and the spirit of the American 1930s, when the luxury of art deco bordered with the poverty of the Great Depression. Although nowadays much more advanced technologies exist, and more impressive skyscrapers can be raised, the Empire State Building remains an icon of American architecture.###"}
{"prompt": "How does Angkor Wat reflect the cultural heritage of East Asia?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Each country in the world has contributed to the world’s cultural heritage. One of the most contributing parts of the world to cultural heritage is East Asia. Architectural, religious, musical, visual, and literary forms of art practiced by East Asian people had been greatly influenced by religious traditions practiced in the region—in particular, Hinduism and Buddhism. One of the most outstanding monuments ever created under the influence of these two paradigms was the temple complex of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.\n\nThe Angkor Wat complex is located in the northern province of Siem Reap. Its overall square is approximately 400-square kilometers; on it, numerous temples, basins, reservoirs, canals, and communication routes are located. Angkor Wat had been a center of the Khmer Kingdom; with its impressive monuments, urban plans, and a complicated system of canals, the site is an exemplar of Khmer architecture, closely linked to the geographical context, and possessing strong symbolic significance. In the Khmer Empire, it had a high level of social order and ranking. Therefore, Angkor Wat has a strong cultural, religious, and symbolic value, as well as aesthetic and artistic significance (UNESCO).\n\nAngkor Wat is so vast that it is difficult to grasp its entire architectural plan if you are  walking around the monument’s territory. From a distance, Angkor Wat looks like a colossal mass of stone, but if you get closer, you will see numerous elevated towers, chambers, and courtyards—all of them located on different levels, and connected with stairways and covered galleries. Angkor Wat’s central tower’s overall height is surprisingly greater than it might seem; it is 699 feet high, which is an amazing index for a building raised in ancient times, without modern cranes and other facilities. This had been achieved with three rectangular or square levels; each of them is progressively smaller and higher than the one below. Covered galleries with columns are located on the first and second levels, and on the third level there are five towers. Four of them are located in the monument’s corners, and the last one is standing in the center. These towers are of a conical shape, and are decorated with the ornament of lotuses (Tourism of Cambodia).\n\nMoreover, the whole monument’s profile imitates a lotus bud. Surprisingly, you cannot see all the five towers at the same time—they are visible only when looking at the monument from certain angles, and if you look from the entrance, you will not be able to see them. The shape of a cross is dominant for the majority of structures and constructions located within the monument, such as courtyards, basins, and so on. The hallmark of Angkor Wat is a curved sloping roof of galleries, chambers, and aisles: from a distance, it looks like a series of long narrow ridges, which looks incredibly beautiful (Tourism of Cambodia).\n\nAngkor Wat is an incredible monument of a civilization that has vanished ages ago. The monument, however, is still standing, reminding us of the greatest days of the Khmer Empire. This is a unique architectural complex, incredibly difficult in its plan and sophisticated in its execution. Therefore, this place is a must-see for any tourist heading to Southeast Asia.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the history of the Taj Mahal?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Although technological progress in the 21st century has enabled people to construct amazing buildings, it does not mean that in the past that people could raise less impressive structures. History knows many examples of incredible and unique architectural decisions: the Notre Dame cathedral, the Egyptian pyramids, the Eiffel Tower, and many others. Among them, the famous Taj Mahal should be mentioned without doubt.\n\nThe Taj Mahal was constructed (or to be more accurate, ordered to be constructed) by the Indian ruler Shah Jahan in the 17th century. It is a mausoleum named after Mumtaz Mahal, the beloved lover of Shah Jahan, from materials including lapis lazuli, jade, crystal, amethyst, and so on. The building’s central dome is slightly more than 70 meters high, and is surrounded by four minarets. According to Islamic tradition, on the walls, there are verses from the Quran written in calligraphy. Inside the mausoleum, there is a false tomb of Mumtaz Mahal (also called a cenotaph), whereas the real sarcophagus with her remains lies at the garden level.\n\nThe Taj Mahal complex also includes a main gateway, a garden with pools of water, a red sandstone mosque, and an identical building called “jawab.”  Shah Jahan wanted to build the second mausoleum across the river, as grandiose as the Taj Mahal, to have his own remains buried there. He also wanted the two mausoleums to be connected with bridges. But, unfortunately, these plans remained on paper.\n\nAurangzeb, Shah Jahan’s third son, deposed his father in 1658, and became the ruler of the country. Shah Jahan ended up under house arrest, locked up in a tower of the Red Fort at Agra. From there, he could see Taj Mahal. He rested in peace in 1666, and his body was buried next to Mumtaz Mahal.\n\nThough almost everyone is familiar with the grandiose architecture of the Taj Mahal, not many know the intriguing history behind it. Though it stands in objective beauty, the Taj Mahal also resonates through history as a sight of mystery and love.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the most technologically-advanced skyscraper in the world?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Living in the 21st century means living in the age of technological wonders—considering, at least, you are living in a first-world or second-world country. Technological progress manifests itself in the surroundings of a modern individual, starting from coffee machines and ending up with larger-than-usual skyscrapers. Speaking of the latter, they have evolved greatly from the times of the Home Insurance Building in Chicago—the first skyscraper ever built. Today, the most technologically-advanced skyscraper is the famous Burj Khalifa in Dubai.\n\nThe Burj Khalifa (or how it was called until 2010, Burj Dubai) opened on January 14th, 2010. Even before the building construction was finished, starting from 2007, it had become the highest skyscraper in the world. Its exact height is 2,722 feet, or 829,8 meters, and it obviously can be seen from any point in Dubai. The number of floors, however, is a bit fewer than some might expects: Burj Khalifa totals in 163 floors, which is 16’2” (about 5 meters) for each floor.\n\nBurj Khalifa looks like a stalagmite, which means it resembles vertical minerals growing from cave floors. Stalagmites usually have a shape of a cone, and so does Burj Khalifa; if you look at it from a distance, it will remind you of a gigantic sharp cone made of glass and steel.\n\nThe most impressive aspect about Burj Khalifa is that it had been planned to be a “city within the city”; this means inside the tower, you can find parks, alleys, districts, fountains, and so on. The glass of the tower’s surface always shines, because it is washed every single day, and the make of concrete of which the tower was built from was invented specifically for Burj Khalifa. There are three entrances to the tower, because it is so huge that one or two would not be enough. At the foot of the skyscraper, there is a big artificial lake that measures up to 12 hectares.\n\nInside, the building is as magnificent as it is from the outside. The interiors were projected by famous designers—for example, the interior of the Armani hotel, located on the floors from first to 39th, was designed by Giorgio Armani himself. The air inside Burj Khalifa is conditioned and flavored—it is said that the flavor was also designed exclusively for the tower; 57 elevators work 24 hours each day to transport visitors between floors.\n\nWriting about Burj Khalifa is a thankless job. The existence of this building is a miracle itself, considering how it stands against the wind, gravity, and other natural forces. With a truly oriental luxurious scope, Burj Khalifa was designed and built to embody the impossible. And one can bravely state that nothing like this skyscraper has ever been built on Earth before.###"}

Not to mention its magnificent contrasts on the edge of modernity and traditionalism, this country can boast of incredibly beautiful nature, rich culture, and technological progress that has outpaced the rest of the world for decades. One of the manifestations of this progress is the famous Tokyo Skytree: an enormous skyscraper built right in the city center, which has changed the city’s appearance dramatically.\n\nThe Tokyo Skytree belongs to the most prominent constructions ever raised by human beings. It is a communications and observation tower located in the Sumida district. It would not be an exaggeration to say it can be seen at almost any place in Tokyo, because it is so incredibly high.\n\nTo be precise, the Tokyo Skytree is 2,080 feet high, which makes it Japan’s tallest structure, and the second highest building in the world, before the famous Burj Khalifa. In this building, broadcasting companies, restaurants, and observation grounds are located, so anyone can enjoy the panorama from the Skytree’s heights.\n\nThe tower reminds of a gigantic tripod in its base, and at the half of its height (1,050 feet) its three “legs” conjoin and form a cylinder, which helps create possibilities for panoramic views all over its perimeter. The tower is painted in a color that is officially called Skytree White. It is said that this bluish white color is based on the so-called Aijiro color, which is traditional for Japanese visual arts. Besides, the tower is illuminated with LED lights, so the Tokyo Skytree’s colors change daily, from pale purple to sky blue.\n\nDue to the use of modern technologies, Tokyo Skytree can also withstand even powerful earthquakes, which occur in Japan rather often.\n\nThe Tokyo Skytree without a doubt is a wonder of technology and industrial design. It makes Tokyo, which has consistently been futuristic, look like a city from the distant future. And, considering Japan’s constant growth and development, many other futuristic buildings will be raised.###"}
{"prompt": "How does Henri Cartier-Bresson's \"Political Meeting\" photograph depict the atmosphere of post-World War II Europe?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Photography has undoubtedly become one of the most impressive and important visual arts of the 20th century, and affected other branches of art significantly. This is, perhaps, one of those arts that are little or not affected by technological progress, and it is only the talent and skill of an artist that matters. There lived many masters of photography, but there was one whose works depicted the entire 20th century with its contradictions and dramas as fully as nobody else managed to. The name of this artist was <b>Henri Cartier-Bresson, the founder of the famous Magnum agency, and one of the most outstanding photographers of all times.\n\nAmong Henri Cartier-Bresson’s works, I especially enjoy the one titled “Political Meeting” made in Paris in 1953. It is a black and white image that depicts a large crowd of people, located in some kind of hangar or manufacturing facility, and a person who is going to hold a speech in front of them (or already is). The composition of the photo is built in such a way that the speaker’s lonely silhouette seems to be contrasted by the infinite crowd of people who gathered at the meeting. This impression is enforced by the lines of the building’s ceiling, which guide the viewer’s sight into the depth of the picture, to a tiny spot of the facility’s exit. The whole picture is sustained in shades of grey of various intensities; the darkest and the brightest spots are the speaker’s figure and the facility’s windows respectively.\n\nThe photograph possesses a strong emotional charge that is easily noticed from the first moments of looking at it. The people seem to be waiting for the orator to offer them a solution to a difficult problem. Perhaps it is a trade-union rally, or a strike. The speaker, in his turn, seems to be somewhat confused, and even overwhelmed by the crowd. It seems that H. Cartier-Bresson has depicted a moment of awkward silence, when the expectations of thousands of people are addressed to a single person, who is confused and does not know what to say. This is a subjective vision, though, and the situation might have developed in a different way.\n\nIn general, the photograph is a depiction of the atmosphere that was established in Europe after the Second World War. It was the time of big changes and social commotions, labor and liberty, hopes and difficulties, and H. Cartier-Bresson has captured it all in just one photo.\n\nCritics globally value H. Cartier-Bresson’s photographs as a high standard. He continually managed to capture the essence of events or persons he pointed his camera at. His photos are not just images shot with professionalism, but are more like short stories, each with its own emotional charge and context. Cartier-Bresson had once said it was life itself, not photography, that interested him the most. And this is what can be easily seen when looking at any of his works.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the characteristics of the olinguito, a newly discovered carnivorous mammal?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Ancient scientists must have had much more work than their modern colleagues, as there were a plethora of undiscovered phenomena, laws of nature, animal species, and so on. Along with scientific and technological progress, people continued to believe in manticoras, chimeras, werewolves, and other mythical creatures. The ancient Chinese manuscript Zuo Zhuan contains descriptions of the Qilin—a creature with a body of a deer, the head of a lion, green scales, and a long horn. Today, new animals are rarely discovered; however, it looks like even in the 21st century, with GPS and satellites, nature still can surprise us. In August of 2013, a new carnivorous mammalian species was discovered: the olinguito.\n\nAn olinguito (or Bassaricyon neblina in Latin) has been classified in the family of procyonidae; the most well-known representative of this family is a raccoon. The discovery of olinguitos, made by Smithsonian scientist Kristofer Helgen, curator of mammals at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, is in fact a rare occasion, as almost 35 years have passed since the last time another carnivorous species had been discovered in both North and South Americas (CNN). Olinguito share about 90 percent of their DNA with olingos—their “sister” species—but still remain a unique carnivore specimen (Time).\n\nConsidered the smallest representative of the raccoon family, olinguitos are jokingly described by scientists as a “cross between a house cat and a teddy bear” (Newsdesk), and weighs about two pounds, while being no bigger than 2.5 feet long. Since olinguitos are nocturnal creatures, they have large eyes that help them navigate in the dark. Olinguitos reside in the misty forests of the South American Andes located at 5,000 to 9,000 feet above sea level, and live in the treetops—they can move through the forests by jumping from one tree to another; perhaps, this is one of the reasons why they have remained unclassified by science for such a long time.\n\nOlinguitos primarily eat fruits, but also feed on insects, which gives a reason to classify these animals as carnivores. According to Helgen, there seems to be four subspecies of olinguitos that differ mostly by color (their fur can be of different shades of reds, oranges, and browns) and by the area of the Andes that they inhabit. Helgen said it is rather unusual to discover the olinguito: “I honestly think that this could be the last time in history that we will turn up this kind of situation—both a new carnivore, and one that’s widespread enough to have multiple kinds” (Smithsonian.com).\n\nAccording to the descriptions provided by scientists, olinguitos seem to be cute carnivorous creatures belonging to the raccoon family that have been recently discovered. They are rather small—about 2.5 feet long and weighing only 2 pounds—and feed primarily on fruit, though insects also make a part of their diet. They inhabit the misty forests of South America and are nocturnal creatures, which results in the large size of their eyes. There seem to exist four subspecies of olinguito, differing only in fur color and regions of the Andes they inhabit. It has been a long time since scientists have discovered a rare mammalian species and it might be even longer until the scientific community happens upon a new one.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the biggest mysteries about Earth's oceans?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Humankind has resided on Earth for thousands of years. Though before the 18th century, scientific progress had a rather slow pace, starting from the 20th century, however, humanity quickly and dramatically increased the amounts and quality of knowledge about the planet we live on. Discoveries made about Earth show that it is still full of wonders, despite constant and persistent research conducted by scientists. One of the biggest mysteries today are oceans. According to some data, 95% of oceanic depths are still unexplored (LiveScience). This means there are an unimaginable number of wonders awaiting to be discovered.\n\nA perfect illustration of this thesis is represented by weird creatures regularly being found or filmed in the oceans across the entire planet. For an example, one needs to look no further than giant squids, fish-devils, enormous mantas, and other unique species that most likely had served ancient sailors as sources of inspiration for their legends about deep sea monsters. One of such creatures is the oarfish, which could be a prototype for famous sea serpents; one of the largest of its representatives was found in October, 2013 on the Southern California coast(CNN).\n\nAn oarfish is a gigantic and extremely elongated sea creature; its length can reach about 17 meters long. Presumably, they earned their name due to their length and a slightly compressed body shape. However, its Latin (and scientific) name, which sounds like Regalicidae, is translated as “royal” which makes this species a “king” of other fish. Anyways, it does not mean that all the exemplars of the oarfish are that long; in most cases, their length varies between 2-4 meters (New World Encyclopedia). Oarfish usually inhabit the tropics, though they also can be seen in other regions of the world ocean.\n\nBesides its length, oarfish have other curious characteristics. For example, despite its size, oarfish possesses a surprisingly small mouth with no visible teeth in it. The oarfish does not have any scales as well. Its color is mostly bluish, which is caused by small crystals of guanine deposited in the upper layers of its skin. Their flanks and undersides may be different in color, but in the majority of cases, they are also blue and black (New World Encyclopedia).\n\nThough in the older times oarfish could most likely inspire sailors to have stories about gigantic sea serpents, dangerous and carnivorous, oarfish are known to feed entirely on plankton. It eats small fish, crustaceans, krill, and other smaller prey, which they strain from the water with their grill rakers. However, there were documented cases when oarfish ate cnedarian medusa and little squids. It is interesting to know that when oarfish feed, they usually turn their bodies into a vertical position.\n\nAn oarfish is a unique and fascinating creature. Despite its size and feeding requirements, it does not possess a danger to humans; also, it inhabits deep waters of tropic areas, though sometimes it can be seen elsewhere. Its longest exemplar was known to reach 17 meters long; in October, 2013, one that spanned six meters was found in Southern California. Oarfish are a perfect example of the thesis that we still know little about our planet, especially about our oceans.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the benefits and drawbacks of the Silk Road?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The Silk Road\n\nCenturies prior to the Internet, much earlier than the steam engine, and well before the arrival of the airplane, there still existed a way to connect the world. The Silk Road, the trading path between East and West was the artery which contributed to cultural and monetary exchange between civilizations. Deriving its name from the then rare and highly in-demand commodity, silk, the Silk Road was established roughly 2200 years ago, and comprised of both land and marine routes, spanning more than 4000 miles, across the known world at the time (Vadime, 2001).\n\nFrom ancient China towards the West, the Silk Road snaked through the high valleys of the Tibetan plateau and over the roof of the world – the Himalayan mountain ranges. Passing through the expansive plains of the Indian subcontinent, it ran across the deserts of Arabia to reach the Mediterranean Sea, and onwards to Europe via the sea. Simultaneously, along the coastline of Asia, the Silk Route knitted together the entire region in a triangular web of numerous marine routes – extending from Java in the far East to the coast of Africa in the Southwest (Wilson, 2007).\n\nIn essence, the Silk Road efficiently and effectively connected the entire known world. Primarily a carrier of silk from China to the world, and of rare goods from the world to China, the Silk Road, with time, emerged to become the most significant and only conduit of all goods the world could have exchanged – and even the evils. It ushered in an unprecedented era of progress and prosperity for human civilization. It brought relative food security to regions short of rations. It enabled the exchange of human values: religion, art, and culture. It introduced the world to Marco Polo and his stories. And above all, it helped the spread of knowledge to humankind as it brought the pen, the paper and even the printer to the world.\n\nLikewise, the Silk Road also facilitated the distribution of the wickedness of its era. When Genghis Khan, a tribal wanderer, arose from the anonymity of Mongolia, he took the Silk Road southwards to deliver his wrath to the world. The “Black Death” or bubonic plague raged around the world to the deepest regions of Russia through the Silk Road. Yet, the human quest for the righteousness of the world based on the cherished principle of mutual co-existence far outweighed and outpaced the evils of those times.\n\nThe Silk Road, connected civilization to civilizations, human to humans, trader to traders, artist to artists, soldier to soldiers, and kings to the kings. Thus, it became the colloquial “melting pot,” and a launch-pad for today’s internationalism and glottalization. It aided civilizations in learning from other civilizations. It promoted human values, culture, art, economy, diplomacy, technology and peace, to help shape the modern, prosperous, free and open world.\n\nNot surprisingly, while the original and functional utility of Silk Road has diminished over time, thanks to the modern and efficient means of worldwide exchange like the airplane and the Internet, the timeless esteem the world holds for this historic road remains ceaseless.\n\nBibliography\n\nVadime, E.

{"prompt": "What were some of the challenges involved in the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The Brooklyn Bridge’s construction is one of the great achievements in United States history and helped pave the way for New York City’s rapid expansion in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was an undertaking that required extraordinary effort, sacrifice, and ingenuity by its designers as well as its builders to complete. Its completion was a feat of engineering that was unmatched in its time: it was the longest suspension bridge—the first to use steel-wire—and dominated the New York City skyline as the tallest structure in the western hemisphere (Hiden 476).\n\nThe idea of a bridge linking Manhattan to Brooklyn was first formalized in a petition to the state legislature in 1802 (Feuerstein 24). From the time Dutch settlers arrived in Brooklyn in 1636, there had been a need to travel between Manhattan and Brooklyn (Feuerstein 98). There were many factors that made constructing a bridge there difficult, though. The East River was a wide and busy waterway with large ships and was surrounded by a low-lying area. This required that the bridge have a high clearance to enable ships to enter, be longer than any bridge built before it and have a significant curve. For these reasons, the idea for the bridge was continuously put off in favor of ferry services. Brooklyn’s population continued to swell though, and between 1860 and 1870, it experienced a colossal increase from 266,000 to 396,000 (Feuerstein 19). The City of New York at the time consisted only of Manhattan, which had about double the population of Brooklyn. A bridge was seen as a way to relieve overcrowding in Manhattan, while at the same time aid in the expansion of Brooklyn.\n\nA man named John Roebling came up with the idea for the bridge in 1855 when he became frustrated while waiting for a ferry in 1855 (Logson 341). Roebling was born in 1806 in Germany where he trained to be an engineer. He immigrated to the United States in 1831 and after a failed attempt at making a living as a farmer in Pennsylvania, he found work as a civil engineer (Logson 342). He originally worked on canals and in the process of designing them, he found that he needed better rope. He came up with a new design and method of creating flexible wire ropes and received a patent for this in 1842 (Logson 342). He quickly found additional uses for the invention, one of which was bridges. He completed his first major bridge in 1855, which was the Niagara River Gorge Bridge (Logson 344). After several more successful projects, Roebling began to lobby influential people in New York for a bridge he had designed to cross the East River. In 1867, an act was passed to raise funding for the bridge and two years later, the design for the Brooklyn Bridge was approved. The same month the plans were approved, Roebling’s foot was crushed by a ferry and he soon after died of tetanus (Logson 345). His son, Washington, took over and ground was broken on the bridge on January 3, 1870 (Logson 346).\n\nThe main design feature of the bridge were four fifteen-inch diameter steel cables that would support the enormous expanse of the bridge, which was to be over 6000 feet (Switch 22). In order to support those cables, the towers had to be enormous and they had to be sunk to the bedrock below the East River. The method for digging the river bottom was to sink a wooden box using pressurized air and create an elevator so that workers could be lowered to the box which was called a caisson. In order to pressurize the air, other gases had to be used which were potentially toxic. At least two dozen people died during the construction, most of which occurred from this phenomena. Workers were raised to the surface too quickly and experienced what were referred to as the bends. Roebling’s son, Washington, was himself paralyzed due to this, after which point his wife took charge of the project (Switch 23). Granite finally reached 78 feet down on one side and 44 feet on the other and the towers were eventually finished in 1877.\n\nThe construction of the roadway began in 1878 and finally finished in 1882. By 1883, the longest suspension bridge in the world was finished after thirteen years of development and construction. The opening ceremony was attended by U.S. President Chester A. Arthur and was hailed as the 8th wonder of the world. Not long after Brooklyn became part of New York, the three other boroughs followed shortly thereafter. It far surpassed what was thought of as possible for bridges at the time and laid the foundation for the rapid expansion of bridge building throughout the country. It also allowed New York to expand rapidly by allowing the easy flow of traffic to and from Brooklyn and defined what we today think of as New York City.###"}
{"prompt": "How did Mark Zuckerberg's attributes of ambition, creativity, and risk-tolerance help him become a successful entrepreneur?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Mark Zuckerberg, one of the five co-founders of Facebook, knew exactly what he was doing when he propelled himself into the computer programming business. As a young entrepreneur, Zuckerberg learned that in order to be successful, you must have three key attributes; ambition, creativity, and risk-tolerance.\n\nThe main attribute that Zuckerberg acquired was ambition in order to jump-start his campaign to introduce Facebook to a wider audience than just Harvard University students. Most people believe they are ambitious until the pressure of an external source backs them into a corner and the “way up” seems far away (Open 564). Ambition comes from within as a form of willpower and forces us to make serious decisions in order to be successful. Most entrepreneurs must pay serious dues to get to the point where they need to be. Hard work and dedication is a must, even if you do not think your product will last after its debut. Zuckerberg’s drive to launch Facebook, from his university dormitory, despite the competition of other leading social networks, showed he was committed to his product and had faith it would be a sensation (Open 237).\n\nAnother key attribute that Zuckerberg has is creativity. The development of Facebook was an imaginative idea: having friends and family connect over long distances through images, text status updates, and a personalized forum. When Facebook first hit the Internet, it was plain in design and easy to navigate. Though the website started at this humble beginning, Zuckerberg continued to use his skill of innovation to reshape and rethink Facebook’s design and layout. Rolling out every month or so, new features are developed and deployed on the website to increase its popularity, usability, and efficiency (Collins 17).\n\nZuckerberg has taken many risks to claim his way to fame. One of the main risks any businessperson faces is the factor of their product not selling. In Zuckerberg’s case, his main concern was whether or not Internet users would latch onto Facebook, considering the competition that was present at the time in social media (Rand 46). In addition, Zuckerberg faced the danger of adopting Facebook from another source, as it could have been easily referred to as a copy of a concept that was already patented (Rand 35). Also, after the launch of Facebook in 2004, Zuckerberg had to go through the hurdle of multiple controversies regarding the development of Facebook with a few of the co-founders, specifically from his Harvard roommates Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra (Rand 27).\n\nIt is without dispute that Mark Zuckerberg’s rise to stardom emerged with the development of Facebook. As a young entrepreneur, he obtained three key attributes to instill his success: ambition, creativity, and having a high risk-tolerance. These qualities, if abided by, can ensure success in almost any business entrepreneurial circumstance.###"}
{"prompt": "How did John Maynard Keynes' early life experiences shape his economic beliefs?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Although Sir John Maynard Keynes’ fame is limited to the field of economics, he held sway in affecting governmental policy to a large extent during the Great Depression of the U.S. He is fondly remembered as the father of modern economics (Cutchell 235).\n\nBorn in a well-educated family, Keynes had the advantage of his father’s affluence and mother’s guidance to enable him to study economics without hindrance, unlike most of his contemporaries who had to struggle to make ends meet. He was not only an outstanding student, but was also extremely optimistic. It is widely believed, among economists, this optimism came from a happy childhood and later on, reflected in Keynes’ works as well (Fullen 267). Keynes’ journey to fame began when he entered the Civil Services and joined the India Office in 1906. It is here he realized his true interest lay in the field of economics. Hence, he resigned from his post and shifted to Cambridge where he began with the first ever research of his life on probability theory at the Cambridge University in 1908. He published his first book in 1913 by the title of Indian Currency and Finance (Fullen 148).\n\nHis most accredited contribution, however, was the renditions he made in the concepts of employment, interest and money. According to Keynes, free market mechanisms should be followed. The main idea of his work Treatise on Money highlighted that when interest rates are high, the savings made by the people will exceed the investments being made—as a result, unemployment will increase (Soren 15). At the time, he contradicted the policies of the government and opined government interference is essential for any economy to function properly. He voiced his criticism of the British government and said a period of recession can be beneficial for the economy (Soren 138). It is in this period, he explained, the government should increase investment by way of enhancing infrastructure, health, and other facilities for people. Keynes completely ignored the concept of the long-term and concentrated his research on short and medium terms. He is believed to have said, in response to criticism for ignoring the long-term aspect, “In the long-term, we are all dead.” His book titled The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money was used as an economic bible by the countries which were hit by the Great Depression in the late 1920s (Soren 94). After steering the world economy out of the Great Depression, Keynes made a significant contribution in the formation of the World Bank and IMF (Maller 117).\n\nThere is an entire section of economists who follow him and proudly call themselves the Keynesians. An entire branch of economics is named after him and is known as Keynesian Economics. Due to these reasons and several more, Time magazine included Keynes in the list of 100 most important and influential people of the 20th century in 1999. Keynes has also been portrayed as “Britain’s most famous 20th century economist” by The Economist. Keynes lived his life with optimism and imparted complete justice to the acceptance and fame given to him by the people. His life is an example of his belief and one of his most famous quotes, “Ideas shape the course of history.”###"}
{"prompt": "How was the Terracotta Army created?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Chinese civilization has produced an uncountable number of artifacts valued the world over and considered to be humanity’s cultural heritage. For an example, one needs to look no further than the notorious ceramics of the Ming Dynasty, historic paintings on silk, lacquered boxes, and many other pieces of pictorial and sculptural art. One of the most well-known artifacts is the Terracotta Army—a sculptural ensemble of about 10000 statues.\n\nThe collection depicts the army of the first Emperor of China known as Qin Shi Huang. The statues were found in the early 1970s in a dark cavern in Xian, located in Shangxi province (Capek, 2008). Radiocarbon dating ascertains the sculptures date back to the third century. The idea of recreating a whole army is incredible in the sense that no one remotely had thought of such an idea before. At first, the finding was kept in secret from the rest of the world, but it quickly turned out that archaeologists had run into a discovery they claimed to be the most significant one in the history of sculpture (Man, 2008). This find caused fascination all over the world, since it was the only exact copy of a life-sized army created by humanity.\n\nThe name of the sculptor who created the ensemble is unknown, but he or she must have been a person of immense artistic power and creativity. Most of all, the sculptures are incredibly realistic, depicting the soldiers in extremely detailed form. Little can be said about the background of the sculptor as well, since almost nothing is known about his or her personality. Scientists guess that he or she must have been an individual with a military background, and who could understand the Emperor’s wishes perfectly. The use of terracotta as the main material indicates that the sculptor was a master of their craft; since it is almost impossible for one person to create a masterpiece of such a large scale, it can be assumed that the sculptor passed on their skills and knowledge to other people who had also been working on the statues. In other words, there was no single craftsman working on the Terracotta Army, and the sculptor was actually a mass of ordinary people. The supposed collective of sculptors produced an incredible masterpiece, which has endured for almost two thousand years.\n\nDuring archaeological excavations, three large pits were found; they contained over 8000 real-size soldier figures, 130 chariots, 520 horses, and a further 150 cavalry horses (Capek, 2008). The vast majority of these statues are still buried close to the Emperor’s mausoleum. A large number of tools and implements were found as well (Man, 2008). The Terracotta Army represents funerary art at its best, as a way of linking the world of the dead with the world of the living; it was known that the Emperor wished to take his army with him after his death.\n\nThe Terracotta Army is a unique artifact both by scale and its astonishing accuracy of lifelike replicas. The terracotta figures have been displayed in several different locations, but the most famous one was a recent exhibition at the British Museum in London. It was one of the most exciting demonstrations of Chinese antiquity to western people.###"}
{"prompt": "What was the significance of the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jallianwalla Bagh is a public garden in Amritsar, in the province of Punjab, where thousands of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had gathered for the celebration of the traditional festival Vaisakhi. Vaisakhi is an ancient harvest festival celebrated across Northern India, especially in the region of Punjab. It is a peaceful and convivial festival, which has a significant meaning for the aforementioned religious groups. However, on the 13th of April, 1919, during the annual celebration, gunfire occurred, and many people who came to feast were shot.\n\nThe meeting began at 4:30 p.m., as it was previously scheduled. About an hour later, Brigadier-General Dyer arrived at Bagh, accompanied by 65 Gurkha and 25 Baluchi soldiers. 50 of the general’s soldiers were carrying rifles; two armored cars with machine guns had been brought along with the general as well, though they could not pass the narrow entrance of Bagh and were parked outside. Bagh was surrounded by a number of houses; many of the narrow entrances to the park were kept closed for most of the time. The main entrance was wide, and it was heavily guarded by the soldiers and armored vehicles.\n\nDyer blocked the main exits to the garden without warning. Then, he announced he was going to “punish the Indians for disobedience” (Collett, 2006). As people in the garden became aware of the impending doom, they took to their heels. Most of them ran to the gateway looking for an exit. At the same moment, Dyer ordered his troops to open fire and shoot into the crowd. Many men, women, and children died in the stampedes near the gates, as people tried to get out of the slaughter. Some people jumped into the well in the garden to escape gunfire, and died there.\n\nA plaque near the monument was installed in the garden after India regained independence, stating that at least 120 bodies were pulled out of that well. People also tried to climb up the wall, which stood five feet tall at some places and still higher at other places. They were shot immediately as they clambered up. It is said that firing continued up to 10 minutes. Only after around approximately 1,650 bullets were fired, the gunfire stopped.\n\nAccording to British officials, the number of fatalities was around 379 casualties, and about 1,000 more people were wounded (Lapping, 1985). However, many researchers believe the death figure was much more than was stated. The flame ignited at the Jallianwalla Bagh by General Dyer can be considered one of the major triggers in India’s struggle for freedom, which ended with its independence on the 15th of August, 1947.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the best way to spend a weekend?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " An innate question for humans beings is, “Who am I?” Failing to answer this question can be disastrous for our well-being, since it refers to making a distinctive decision of what we aspire to do, and what we want to achieve in our lives. Consequently, it becomes easier for people to manipulate and shape us into what they want if we do not give ourselves an answer to this fundamental question. As for me, I have become grounded in an idea of myself, and this has aided me in being self-confident.\n\nProfessor Richard Gunde (2002) posits a person’s physical appearance is the foundation on which other people judge them (p. 71). Unfortunately, identifying oneself this way is inaccurate, as other people cannot appropriately deduce who I am by my height or the way I dress. For instance, I am a short person, which consequently assigns me to the lower regions of the social ladder, so to speak. Most people will treat me with prejudice due to my height. But only after these interlocutors interact with me can they more or less form an idea of who I am. A personality—this is a gateway into knowing whom people truly are. Through the personality I exhibit, people can perceive how I am. My friends see me as caring and generous, willing to go an extra mile for them.\n\nIn order for a person to achieve their goals, they need to set high standards and values, and pursue them throughout their entire life with diligence. However, the fact of not many people acting upon this procedure is quite disturbing, as it seems such people go adrift and do not make efforts to manage the many areas of their lives as a coherent whole. I think I could be called an exception among my friends. I am a focused and organized person who is determined to achieve the best life has offered me in the way of opportunities. I know when I will retire, and what activities I should engage in at their correct time in my life. I also know how much money I will have saved by the time I am 50 years old.\n\nBesides being above the rest in determination and organization, I have a penchant for writing. I attribute this to my parents, who were both teachers and encouraged me to read and write from a tender age. By the time I was three, I could read and write, and I would spend my spare time cuddled up on the floor trying to make sense of high school textbooks while my peers were out playing in the sandpit. When writing, at times I get so enthusiastic, I hardly realize what I am trying to put across. My fingers fly over the keyboard and ideas pour from my head. Later, when I go through the hodgepodge of scribbled ideas, I invariably notice themes. Evaluating these themes help me decipher my bottled-up emotions and interpret my characters. In stories, the characters express my viewpoint. Opinion essays, on the other hand, demonstrate my values.\n\nI believe physical appearances are not the best yardstick for evaluating who a person is. My personality, ambitions, and what I love doing should be the best criteria for defining my identity. One should never be worried if they do not know everything about themselves, as we are continuously learning and discovering new aspects of ourselves. Personally, I am satisfied knowing my friends value me and consider me an asset.\n\nReference\n\nGunde, Richard. (2002). Who am I? Where did I come from?

{"prompt": "How has the Dalai Lama's life been a complex mixture of political and spiritual leadership?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The 14th Dalai Lama is perhaps one of the most interesting and significant public figures of the modern era. His struggle to maintain the culture, identity, and religion of the Tibetan people are renowned. The Dalai Lama’s peaceful manner and joyful approach to life is inspiring, despite the fact that he has lived most of his adult life as “a stateless refugee in India” (Beyond Religion, 2011). The Dalai Lama’s life path is endlessly uplifting as a humanitarian example and his role in modern history is difficult to overestimate.\n\nThe Dalai Lama was born in 1935 to a family of poor farmers in Taktser, a small village in the Amdo province (From Birth to Exile, n.d.) of what was then known as Tibet. These humble beginnings contrasted starkly with the new life into which he was thrust into when he was declared to be the “new incarnation of the Dalai Lama” when he was not quite three years old (From Birth to Exile, n.d.). In 1959, he had to flee to India because of the Tibetan uprising; there he denounced the People’s Republic of China and established a Tibetan government while in exile. Since that time, he has traveled around the world propagating the ideals of peace and equality, advocating the welfare of Tibetans, and propagating the ideals of Tibetan Buddhism. Many people around the world know the Dalai Lama primarily as an influential political leader and the Nobel Peace Prize winner.\n\nDalai Lama’s spirituality and wisdom is the subject of admiration among his followers. According to the Dalai Lama’s webpage, “he frequently states that his life is guided by three major commitments: the promotion of basic human values or secular ethics in the interest of human happiness, the fostering of inter-religious harmony and the welfare of the Tibetan people, focusing on the survival of their identity, culture and religion” (dalailama.com, n.d.). In his book, The Art of Happiness, the Dalai Lama lays out his blueprint for achieving happiness through training the mind. He often emphasizes how important compassion is as a source of a happy life for every human being. The Dalai Lama has always been the incarnation and conductor of his ideas into the world and many people have changed their lives with the help of his teachings.\n\nMany of Dalai Lama’s philosophical and ethical views come from, or are a continuation of, the ancient Buddhist teachings. The Dalai Lama has spent a lifetime learning Buddhist philosophy and methods of meditation. He has worked tirelessly to promote peace throughout the world using his knowledge of Buddhist precepts as his guide (Living Wisdom, 2006). One of the key points of his doctrine is a concept of non-violence, not only toward human beings, but all living creatures. Together with other great teachers of humanity, Dalai Lama prescribes us to be patient towards each other, to resolve conflicts peacefully, and to be tolerant of the flaws of other people. The strengths of these conceptions are multiplied by Dalai Lama’s personal charisma, his ability to persuade, and his authority as a religious and philosophical guru.\n\nThe Dalai Lama is a complex person who has lived a fascinating life. His whole existence has been marked with his recognition of himself as the reincarnated leader of Tibetan Buddhism. Though he is seen as a political figure, he is also renowned for dedicating his life to advocating the rights and the well-being of Tibetan people and to propagating the ideals of peace and tolerance. The 14th Dalai Lama possesses a strong and charismatic personality; he is a living embodiment of his own teaching about the importance of love and compassion. While many of his ideas have their roots in ancient Buddhism, the Dalai Lama has made them easier to understand for many of his followers all over the world.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the significance of the Great Wall of China?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " China is the largest country in Asia and the world’s most populous nation. It also has one of the world’s oldest and continuous civilizations. The Chinese have occupied their vast territory for thousands of years and China has numerous achievements in a variety of disciplines. The country has produced many great thinkers and philosophers, and numerous artists and inventors from China have introduced creations that have changed perhaps billions of lives. Some of these creations include the compass, gunpowder, paper, printing, porcelain, and silk. But perhaps the most well-known and recognized symbol of China is the Great Wall.\n\nThe Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east at the Yellow Sea, travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall. According to conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s length is approximately 2,400 miles, its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders (Turnbull & Noon, 2007).\n\nAlthough it is often mistakenly thought of as a single wall, the Great Wall is a series of walls that were constructed, reconstructed, and expanded over several centuries and, depending on the location, having different materials. The massive construction project was the idea of China’s first emperor, Shi Huangdi, who ended more than 250 years of regional fighting between several independent states, and united China. Once in control, Shi Huangdi wanted to maintain his power and position. The idea to create a massive wall along the northern border of the country was conceived by the emperor to bar assailants from kingdoms to the north of China. The construction of the Great Wall continued long after the reign of Shi Huangdi, particularly during the Han and the Ming dynasties. During these periods, features such as watch towers, gates, and garrisons were added or enhanced, and the Great Wall’s design was unified (Marsh, 2006).\n\nThe Great Wall is of great significance, as it reflects much of China’s extensive history. The Great Wall helped define the empire and mark a boundary between the Chinese and foreigners. The great emperor, Shi Huangdi, wanted to keep the Chinese people together and at the same time isolate foreigners, especially those to the north (Sterling, 2009). The Great Wall survives today, more than 2,000 years after its initial construction. It attracts thousands of visitors from all over the world each day, being one of the most toured and significant monuments in the world. This has helped boost China’s economy through tourism and foreign exchange (Collins, Staton & Milgrom, 2010).\n\nThe Great Wall is undeniably one of humankind’s most prominent and enduring architectural feats. It is a testament to a people’s ability to plan, organize, create, and work diligently together. The wall is a monument to Chinese civilization, one that came at great costs and through countless sacrifices.###"}
{"prompt": "What is your favorite spot in the city and why?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. However, before I moved to New York City, I was apparently not well-prepared for surviving in the Big Apple. I love NYC, but sometimes it becomes too much, and I have to escape from the noise to free my mind from all the routine worries, to clear my thoughts, and remind myself that despite how difficult and challenging life can get, I still have to enjoy the road along the way to success while achieving my dreams.\n\nEveryone needs to take a break from the crazy pace of NYC lifestyle, once in a while. When I ask myself where the best place to do that is, I do not have to think for more than a second. My favorite spot in the NYC isVan Cortlandt Park, with its long paved trails that I so much like to ride on my bike, passing jungles of trees and bushes so wild that they make you believe you have escaped the city completely and are somewhere in the middle of a real rich forest. I love its ample, spacious green valleys that remind me of those gorgeous Scottish hills you can sometimes see in movies, with white, puffy dots of sheep, and lonely, chunky trees. I adore the impetuous, dashing stream of the Tibbets Brook, and the contrasting calm and breathless pacifying waters of the Van Cortlandt lake.\n\nLast week, I made my annual escape to the park. I was alone, did not take my bike this time, only my camera and my five senses, which was all I needed to enjoy a day away from work, buzz, and crowds. I first went to the Parade Ground, watched as a couple of cricket players run back and forth in their crisp, white mantles that sparkled in the sun. The players were like those sheep in the Scottish hills, only whiter and much faster. Not wanting to get burned in the bright morning sun rays, I quickly moved on to reach my destination—the meadow grass plot in the middle of the oak forest. I had spotted at this location before, and promised myself to go there again.\n\nAs I moved through the dense forest of the park, I pushed away the ample fluffy branches that came my way, trying not to hurt any of the big flat leaves, or neat, perfect acorns that covered each branch. Wanting to be closer to nature, I decided not to take the pathway but, instead, go directly through the forest. It was as if there was no sign of civilization around me. The oak trees were my favorite, with their wide, strong, mossy trunks and tender, roundish leaves. The air was still wet from the early morning shower—while everywhere, in the open, it had already been dry and hot, as if there had not been no shower. The shadows of the forest still preserved the humidity, intensified by the smell of wet moss and last year’s leaves that still laid on the ground. I loved this deep moist air, saturated with oxygen and filled with freshness.\n\nAs I was moving through the forest, a couple of times I came across little glades with no trees. They were intensely lit by the rays of the summer sun, like small islands of happiness, not enough to make me too hot from the fullness of sunlight, but enough to bathe my face and arms in their warmth. And when it got too hot, I could again dive into the pool of fresh, moist greens of the forest to appreciate the shadows of the generous old oaks. I stopped a few times, took my camera out, and captured the play of the light and shadow, spellbound by nature’s simple beauty that we tend not to notice, looking for chic and glam instead.\n\nA half an hour later, I was at my destination point. The valley lay right in the middle of the park, between the forest and the lake, thoughtfully muffled by nature, protected from the inner noises and fuss. There were a couple of people already sitting on the grass, picnicking, reading, laying down dreaming. Even though I was not alone on the meadow this time, I appreciated this fact: I could observe the people merge and coalesce with nature in this somewhat Utopian picture of a perfect idyll.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the most memorable restaurant you have ever been to?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Whenever I travel abroad, I try to eat out as much as possible in order to get an idea of the national cuisine of the country or province I am visiting to be able to delve deeper into the local culture. Over the years of travelling around the world, I have been to a great number of unusual and interesting restaurants that impressed me. If I were to make a list of the most memorable local restaurants and cafes that I have visited abroad over the past 12 years, New Zealand’s Yellow Treehouse would definitely make it to the top of the list.\n\nThis restaurant is located in the woods of Warkworth, about a 40-minute drive north of Auckland. The description of the place is in its name – a wooden tree house built ten meters above the ground on a Redwood tree. If you think it is nothing special, you are wrong. The restaurant is unusual looking and does not resemble anything I have seen before. From the ground, it looks like a small onion-shaped knag in the middle of the tree trunk that is softly illuminated with orange and yellow lights. It also has a narrow wooden bridge leading to it that connects the restaurant with a bunch of the neighboring trees that are also illuminated. The place looks particularly pretty at night, and the walk to the café by the bridge is really something!\n\nInside, the place feels quite different from what it looks like outside. The seemingly fragile construction made of thin and flexible wooden bars, bent in the middle to form a dome shaped construction, is cozy and spacious inside. What I liked the most about the construction is probably the fact that not only is it located in the woods, far from the roads, city noises and smog, surrounded by nothing but the trees and the local fauna, it is in fact built entirely of natural materials. The whole construction is authentic, simple in its interior and exterior design, yet obviously well thought-out. The restaurant is meant to host up to 30 guests at a time, and to me, is a perfect place for a romantic getaway, or a family celebration, like a wedding anniversary, a birthday, or a small engagement party.\n\nThe chef of the place does a great job as well. The dishes we ordered were delicious and juicy. The menu mainly consists of local cuisine; the wine list consists of a great selection of New Zealand’s white and red wines. Overall, the dinner was tasty, and the service provided unobtrusive, yet attentive and polite. Their waiters were an excellent addition to the pleasant experience. The place is a must-see, or rather a must-eat-in, to those who are visiting the country and want to get a scope of the most vibrant impressions. While the rest of the world is competing in construction of the highest and ugliest concrete-and-glass skyscrapers, New Zealand is coming back to the roots, both figuratively and literally speaking, with this unique wooden tree house restaurant that reminds us all that going back to basics will always be the ultimate solution.###"}
{"prompt": "What is your favorite piece of art and why?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Modern art was never my cup of tea. I enjoy mainly old oil paintings of the French impressionism era by Oscar-Claude Monet or Eugène Boudin, with their gaudy ornate shapes, romantic pastel colors, and vivid, rich nature—or the incredible juxtapositions and surprising idiosyncratic combinations in the surrealistic fantasies by Salvador Dalí and Pablo Picasso. But not modern art, with its minimalistic and bold lines, simplistic shapes, and daringly loud colors. To me, modern art is too much about the hidden, and too little about the visible sense behind a painting. But, I do realize that I might be wrong in labeling all modern art with one cliche, thus I am always open to new experiences. So, when my friend invited me to a gallery exhibition by Jack Long last week, whom I had never heard of before, I was quite enthusiastic about it. When I saw the works by this artist from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I was truly amazed.\n\nThe exhibition comprised of a collection of the photographs that the artist had named “Vessels and Blooms.” I have seen instant photography pictures before, but nothing that artistic. It usually looked like a set of bright and juicy splashes of colored water, beverages, or paints captured randomly, with no particular order, except for the combination of shades that would look aesthetic or contrasting together. But, what Jack Long has done is a completely new level of instant photography combined with fine art. The artist (I believe it would be wrong to call him simply a photographer, since what he does looks more like paintings than like photography) creates amazingly beautiful pictures using water, dyes, pigments, and thickeners, shaping them into flowerpots of lilies, tulips, roses, peonies, and orchids. These exceptionally realistic, glossy, and bright three-dimensional images—with a hint of movement to them, which made the pictures somewhat romantic—instantly mesmerized me. The artist captures a single moment and does more than just preserve it. He creates the art during those milliseconds of beauty that flickers in front of us, and that our eyes would not be able to capture otherwise.\n\nOne image had a particularly strong impression on me. It was a bright orange flower on a plain wide background. It resembled a fragile poppy, being torn apart by the wind, vulnerable to the air attack, but so beautiful and breathtakingly tender. The primarily orange flower had mustard yellow specks and inclusions that formed a subtle and elusive transparency of the flower’s pestles. This evasive and tenuous image reminded me of the fragility of nature’s beauty, and its vulnerability under human’s influence and the polluting impact of our existence. The delicateness of this image, and the beauty of the idea, hypnotized me. I could not look away from this magnificent picture with which I instantly fell in love, so I just had to purchase it. And now this frail and gorgeous orange flower on a dainty brittle stem is what I look at every day, and instantly remember how precious the feeling of happiness is. I cannot help but associate this meringue and airy flower with love and happiness—so imperceptible, volatile, and eluding, yet so magical and breathtaking at the same time.  Thank you, Jack Long, for the inspiration and fervor that one of your works brings into my life every day now!###"}
{"prompt": "What is your favorite restaurant and why?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As a child, I was not fond of eating out. My family would eat at a restaurant, diner, or buffet at least once a week, often more than once. Every time we went anywhere, but for a little place called Rivenee’s, it was a challenge for my parents to find proper food and a nice atmosphere. Rivenee’s was that lucky exception—I loved the place and this made my parents love it too. The restaurant seemed magical and fascinating to me when I was an elementary school kid, and surprisingly, the place still fascinates me today. Recently, when I visited my old family house for Thanksgiving, I was astonished and pleased to find out the place still operated and, in fact, was still run by the same family. Apart from the house in which I grew up, Rivenee’s is probably the dearest place to me in the small town, just outside of San Ramon, where I was born and raised.\n\nRivenee’s is a small and cozy place, and this is what probably garnered my love of the restaurant initially. This, and the people who worked and still work there. Unlike more spacious restaurants, diners, and chain buffets my parents also took me to, Rivenee’s was a family-owned business run by a middle-aged couple, Janette and Derek. When I think about them now, I still remember their warm smiles and sincere care for each customer and employee. Mrs. Jan, as I would call her, loved orange shades, both in her outfits and in the restaurant’s interior decor. Warm orange and yellow-pomegranate furniture, sunny-colored napkins and curtains, country-style hard wooden tables and stools at the bar—everything was solid and comfortable about the place. Mrs. Jan would always have orange in her outfit— to match the place, as I then thought. Be it a bright orange ribbon in her hair, or a peachy neat cotton dress, or red nail polish—this woman belonged to the place like nobody else, and I doubt it was only the external resemblance.\n\nHer husband Mr. Derek was older, with graying hair and a miniature mustache, which made him look a bit strict to me at the time. But the moment he started talking with his deep, soft, and half-laughing voice, with that particular tender frog-in-the-throat vibe, he would make me listen to his every word with an open mouth. The man was like a magician to me: mysterious and a bit scary even, yet so fascinating and magnetic. There was his daughter as well, the first love of mine. She was a blonde pony-tailed girl of 7 or 8 with cute bangs, lively, and active. She would be running around the place, attracting the attention of visitors with her sonorous laughter that made you laugh in return, or at least smile back at the small, sunny creature cruising around the place.\n\nWhen I visited Rivenee’s after all these years, the memories flashed back through my mind in a heartbeat, and I suddenly felt like a child again. The place was still an illuminating planet of orange and light, yet comfortably relaxing and pulsating with fresh energy. I instantly felt like I was home, and a big bouquet of freshly cut wild daisies, neatly tied with an orange ribbon made me think of Mrs. Jan. The food tasted the same—crispy and puffy home-made corn bread was my favorite part of the meal then, and it tasted like it did in my childhood to me now. My parents still eat at Rivenee’s from time to time, still order their favorite specials and enjoy the evening with Mrs. Jan and Mr. Derek, remembering the good old times.###"}
{"prompt": "What is the most significant event that occurred during your trip to Central Europe?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The history of Central Europe has fascinated me for several years, though I did not expect it to be as it was described in the books I read about it. You know how whenever an event you anticipate becomes reality, it never lives up to your expectations? When my friend suggested that we go to Central Europe on a summer vacation, I was prepared to be disappointed, even though I was excited about the endeavor. It turned out to be the opposite of my anticipations. Central European opulence and nobleness lingering in the atmosphere, and its architectural and historical allure went beyond my imagination. Out of all the cities and towns we visited in Central Europe, which included Vienna, Warsaw, Munich, Hamburg, Berlin, Budapest, and Krakow, the city that made the biggest impression on me was definitely Prague.\n\nI do not know if it is the story behind the landmarks, stones and bridges, if it is the gorgeous majesty of façade detail of the incredible Gothic cathedrals, or the resplendence of the interior finery of the castles and cathedrals that left me speechless. But to this day, I have no doubt that there is no other city in the world that can compare to Prague. With its peculiar romantic scent, fresh youthfulness of the students, and picturesque city views, Prague to me is far more attractive than Paris, London, and New York combined.\n\nMy acquaintance with Prague began on a bus from Vienna, where I listened to a tour guide telling us the story of how the city was established. When we arrived in Prague, the first landmark we went to see right from our hotel, Hivan, was the Charles Bridge. With its foundation laid in 1357, this pedestrian bridge across Vltava was literally built on blood and eggs that were poured into the composite to hold bricks together, and it proved to be firmer than any cement mix at the time. Fascinated by this fact, we went on to examine the statues of saints on nearly every post of the bridge, while we listened to the story behind each of the figures.\n\nThere were many other elements of Prague that inspired and fascinated me: the beautiful and mysterious Loretta; the breathtaking and sublime Saint Vitus’ Cathedral; the eminent and enduring Church of Mother of God before Týn; the fantastic and dreamlike Dancing House; and the childishly bright and colorful Zlatá Ulika, where you feel like you are a part of a fairy tale. The whole of Prague is like a fairy tale of its own, with the millions of unbelievable stories running through its veins. But the event that made the significant impression on me was the sunset above Prague Castle.\n\nThe scenery was bewitching, dazzling, and breathtaking. The sun, barely reaching the sharp peaks of the Castle that pierced the peachy sky with soft billowy clouds; the shadows of the towers reflecting in the peaceful waters of Vltava; the slightly audible melody of violin and flute echoing in the air. The atmosphere caressed me into thinking that time had stopped—like I had traveled back in time to the medieval era.\n\nWe spent over three weeks in Central Europe, and just two days in Prague. But it seems like my memories of Prague have overshadowed the rest of the journey, taking up most of my emotions and feelings associated with this trip. Prague is worth composing laudatory odes and songs about—Prague is worth admiring, and most certainly, Prague is worth visiting again and again, as it has an ample history that you can unveil and discover every bit of and still be mystified.###"}
