{"prompt": "How do the book and movie versions of \"Starship Troopers\" differ in their focus?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Science fiction is one literary genre whose possibilities in terms of generating engaging stories are infinite. The only limit a science-fiction author has is his or her imagination. However impossible, crazy, or unbelievable a world described in the novel is, if the author is talented, he or she will make it real for an audience. Robert Heinlein was one of such masters. It is probably difficult to find a person in the western world who would not at least partially be aware of his legacy, or who would have not read such masterpieces as “The Puppet Masters,” “Tunnel in the Sky,” Citizen of the Galaxy,” and many others.\n\nThere is, however, one novel that has become a true cult classic: “Starship Troopers,” a title that is probably familiar to everyone living in the West. The original story was published in 1959, and a year later brought Heinlein the Hugo Award for Best Novel. Despite it having been written more than half a century ago, “Starship Troopers” still remains a book without age–meaning that it does not look obsolete. On the contrary, it is one of those novels that serve as a mainframe, a roadmap to younger generations of authors who inherit the structure and the narrative of classics.\n\n“Starship Troopers” did not have a literary sequel, but there were several movies released after the novel. In fact, there were three screen versions, but the first one is the best, so for the sake of comparison, let us juxtapose the novel with just one movie.\n\nThe book itself is written in the genre of military science fiction on behalf of the main character: Juan “Johnny” Rico. A regular teenager from Buenos Aires, he decides to enter the ranks of the army in order to earn his right to vote and become a citizen. In the world Heinlein describes, the population of Earth (or Terra, as it is named in the book) lives in a controlled democracy, a federation ruled by the military elite. The society is prosperous, even though not everyone can enjoy the full scale of civic rights. Citizenship and the rights it grants are extremely valuable, and thus come with great responsibility. One must work hard to prove one can bear it. It does not mean that those without citizenship are in any way inferior: on the contrary, the society is described as rationally organized, and not everyone wants to be a citizen, as even without this legality, life is good. Anyways, Rico decides he wants these rights, he is ready for hardships, so he joins the Mobile Infantry. While he is serving in the army, humanity is attacked by a race of Arachnids, or Bugs, as they are referred to in the book. And so, Rico enters the war.\n\nThe storyline of the book mostly revolves around Rico’s time in Camp Arthur Currie: a place where all the rookies have to undergo severe training, physical and moral, to become soldiers. Later, when Rico is already a trooper and has some experience, he starts studying to become an officer–the true elite of the army. Rico’s studying, him gaining experience, becoming able to see deeper into the nature of the society he lives in or the war the human race is engaged in–this is the true story, the true conflict of “Starship Troopers.” In this regard, this book is a coming-of-age novel, which shows a long and curvy road a teenager hothead has to walk before he or she can become a true member of society. Very similar to the “Catcher in the Rye,” “Starship Troopers” focuses on one personality placed into a social context. The war, military losses, the Federation (which is actually a fascist state) and its propaganda: all this serves only as a background for Rico’s growth.\n\nUnlike the novel, the movie focuses around the war itself. Filmed by Paul Verhoeven in 1997, it is a masterpiece of its own. It does share similarities with the book, and the overall storyline is generally the same. There are, however, several crucial discrepancies. They do not make the movie worse than the book: in fact, both of them are great, but each in its own way. Verhoeven’s movie focuses mostly on the context in which Rico and his closest friends live. The movie is full of cheesy militaristic propaganda praising the Terran Federation and denouncing the Bugs. These advertisements are a pleasure to watch on their own; if you remember Verhoeven’s “RoboCop” (1987), you can imagine how it looks and feels. At the same time, they do a great job describing the society of the future, conveying its spirit–even though it is not depicted in the movie as detailed as in the novel. However, the emphasis of the film is on the war against the Bugs. Combat, special effects, animatronic dolls, decorations–all this looks good and feels good. However, this is not a movie about Rico’s coming-of-age: it is mostly about him already being a true citizen, a hero, a role model. Johnny’s doubts, fears, thoughts, failures, and insights are left somewhere behind the scenes: in the movie, he has already found all the answers he needed—and this is probably the biggest difference between the book and the movie.\n\n“Starship Troopers” is a great coming-of-age novel. Set in beautiful scenes of the distant future, it tells a story of a young man’s maturation, of him realizing his civic duties, the nature of the society he lives in–and of his agreement to continue living in this society. The movie, in its turn, is intentionally filled with militaristic pathos. It focuses on the atmosphere of a fascist interstellar empire called “Terran Federation,” on its propaganda materials, on its spirit. And, of course, on the war with the Bugs. The book is more of a contemplative autobiography (although it is vividly written and engaging), whereas the film is more of an action movie. Both are good, however, and should be acquainted with.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the four main styles of parenting?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As a parent, we have to be aware of the many styles of parenting that exist. There is no style that fits every child’s needs, and we should adapt our parenting style to our children and our own personality. There is also nothing wrong with mixing styles. To elaborate, there are four main styles of parenting: authoritarian, permissive, uninvolved, and authoritative. Let us delve into each of these styles to understand how we can become better parents, and to comprehend our mistakes in raising our children.\n\nAuthoritarian parenting is perhaps the most aggressive and strict style of raising children. It is only recommended when a high amount of discipline is needed in order to correct a child. According to VeryWellMind, “Authoritarian parenting is a parenting style characterized by high demands and low responsiveness. Parents with an authoritarian style have very high expectations of their children, yet provide very little in the way of feedback and nurturance. Mistakes tend to be punished harshly” (Cherry, Kendra, and Steven Gans). Unfortunately, when feedback is given to a child, it is commonly in the form of yelling and other aggressive acts. Though children of authoritarian parents might succeed in society at higher rates, they will often carry a lifetime of animosity towards their parents and develop deep psychological issues.\n\nThe opposite of authoritarian parenting is permissive parenting. In order to not tamper with a children’s happiness or satisfaction, parents sometimes will be involved in their children’s lives without setting many limits on them. Based on Vanderbilt University’s studies, “These parents are responsive but not demanding. These parents tend to be lenient while trying to avoid confrontation. The benefit of this parenting style is that they are usually very nurturing and loving” (Vanderbilt University). The negatives of this approach are a lack of self-control and patience in the future. Parents might also be tied down by fear, feeling afraid to do anything against the wishes of their children.\n\nSimilar to permissive parenting, uninvolved parenting implies putting the raising of children in the back of one’s mind. For many reasons, parents consider parenting only a side deal in comparison to their careers and other life aspirations. According to Momjunction, “A parenting style where the child does not get an adequate amount of emotional support, physical time of the parent, basic needs such as food, shelter, health care, childhood play, and academic support, can be termed as being neglectful. Neglectful parenting, or uninvolved parents have the least amount of involvement or response towards their children’s needs. They just provide the most basic of facilities but no room or opportunity for recreational and developmental activities” (Awasthi, Deeksha). In this form of parenting, discipline rarely has a place, and hardly any demands are put on children. Parents who follow this style commonly are emotionally detached, and are usually recommended to seek psychological help.\n\nNot too different from the authoritarian style, authoritative parenting combines responsiveness with demands. It is commonly the most recommended parenting style, as it sets limits for children, while offering them support. According to Parenting for Brain, “Studies have found that preschoolers raised by authoritative parents tend to be happy and content, are independent and self-reliant, develop good social skills,have good emotional regulation and self-control, express warmth and cooperate with peers, explore new environment without fear, and are competent and assertive. Older children with authoritative parents achieve higher academic success, engage more in school activities. develop good self-esteem, have better mental health — less depression, anxiety, suicide attempts, delinquency, alcohol and drug use, interact with peers using competent social skills, and exhibit less violent tendencies” (Parenting For Brain). As you can see, this parenting style leads to the most benefits with the least amount of disadvantages.\n\nThere are many occasions to go to extremes while parenting. With four distinct parenting styles—authoritarian, permissive, uninvolved, and authoritative—there is a range of methods for raising children. It has been shown, though, that perhaps authoritative parenting is the most healthy of all the options.###"}
{"prompt": "How have our attitudes towards human nature changed since the 18th century?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " ‘Oklahoma, 1973’, begins the documentary account of an experiment to teach a baby chimpanzee human language and thus, in the words of one of the researchers, ‘test the nature versus nurture hypothesis’. And through today’s eyes, the eyes of film-maker James Marsh (of Man on Wire fame), much of that experiment seems bizarre if not downright wrong. Nim’s first surrogate mother, Stephanie Lafarge, takes the baby chimp into her home like another baby, changing its nappies, dressing it and even breastfeeding the animal for several months.\n\nThe film is a mixture of interviews, archive footage. and reconstruction, and the testimony of the humans involved is, of course, far more revealing about them than about Nim. Both Stephanie and her daughter recall how Nim quickly learned to manipulate the dynamics of the family, playing off the jealousy of Stephanie’s poet husband (who was not consulted before the baby ape moved in) and defying the authority of the project’s supervisor, professor Herb Terrace, when he visited.\n\nBut while chimps are social animals with a strong sense of power relationships, it is also clear that Stephanie was playing games of her own. The ostensible purpose of the project was to teach Nim sign language, but at one point, she says ‘words became the enemy’ in her relationship with writer husband and linguistic psychologist (and ex-lover) Herb. And when Herb removes the chimp, and puts Nim in the care of attractive 18-year-old student Laura-Ann Pettito, the human dynamics continue to overshadow the scientific study of an ape learning sign language.\n\nYet the excitement of the researchers is clear. If they can teach a chimpanzee to communicate, they can find out how it ‘thinks’. They are well aware of how radical an idea this is, a potential breaking down of the barrier between humans and animals. It is an ideal that sits well in their hippy era and milieu. Unfortunately for them, a chimpanzee is not a child. From the start, Nim uses violence to assert himself in social interactions, and as he grows stronger physically, this makes the ‘chimp as child’ conceit harder and harder to sustain. The researchers suffer bites that sever arteries and tendons, and one has her face torn open. Nim uses the sign for ‘sorry’ after these attacks, but they continue. Eventually, Herb decides to return Nim to the research facility where he was born.\n\nMarsh’s interviews reveal just how emotionally involved the humans became with Nim, but the story itself is told as a biography of the chimp. So, it is impossible to avoid seeing how the contradictions of the human attitudes to the ape—treating it like a baby and then like the dangerous animal it is—added to Nim’s distress. One minute he is a spoilt pet with the run of a country house, the next he is in a cage with other chimpanzees, a social group he has never learned to live in. So, while we are invited to empathise with the humans, still crying all these years later as they recall leaving Nim in his cage, it also implicitly criticises them for having taught him to live around humans and then thrown him back in with the other experimental subjects. And yet, the film humanises Nim in our eyes too, so when he is sold on to a medical research establishment, we identify not with the human scientists but with the apes.\n\nIf this 1970s experiment reveals that era’s confusion about where apes end and humans begin, the film says much about today’s ambivalent attitudes too. So, it is worth comparing it to Francois Truffaut’s L’Enfant Sauvage, a 1970 feature film based closely on Dr Jean Itard’s account of his own experiment 170 years earlier. In 1798, a boy is found in the woods, apparently without language and completely unsocialised. Dr Itard reads about the boy and brings him to Paris to be the subject of his own experiment in nature and nurture, to see whether a child of around 11 can be transformed by education from a near-animal into a civilised man.\n\nAt first, there are many parallels in the behaviour of the boy, whom the doctor names ‘Victor’, and that of Nim. Both show instinctive fear and resistance, bite their captors, and have to be restrained with a rope from running away. Both learn table manners and to ask for food and drink. Both—in strikingly parallel scenes—love to be wheeled around at high speed, Nim in a child’s pushchair and Victor in a wheelbarrow. But there are vital differences in the two experiments. Dr Itard wants to teach Victor language not to see the world through the eyes of a boy who survived in the forest for 10 years, but to equip him to communicate with the wider world and—crucially—to be able to ask for things which are not in front of his eyes. He is thrilled by Victor’s spontaneous tool making, when the boy fashions a chalk-holder, but even more thrilled when he shows that Victor has developed a sense of justice and thus become ‘a moral being’.\n\nThis investigation into human nature happened in revolutionary France—supported by a grant—and aspired to prove that the most savage human being had the potential to be civilised—that human potential outstrips what initial circumstances endow on us, and that we are all capable of learning not only the superficial trappings of human society but to be free, moral agents. Through the prism of 1970, the 1798 experiment looks cruel at times, but though Dr Itard treats Victor harshly, he sees the fellow human in him. The educator’s struggle to turn a wild child into a full member of human society, and the implicit faith that we are all capable, given the right conditions, of thus flourishing, is an echo of Enlightenment optimism in 20th century France.\n\nBy contrast, the Project Nim experiment saw the capacity for language as not uniquely human. It was based on the idea that nurture alone is responsible for making us human—that even an ape can have essentially human characteristics if it is reared with humans. Though the film, with 21st century eyes, is critical of confusing chimpanzee nature with human nature because of its adverse effects on Nim’s happiness, it does not entirely reject the basis of the failed experiment. As well as criticising human willingness to treat animals as experimental subjects, Project Nim draws implicit parallels between Nim’s behaviour and that of the humans studying him. It takes care not to elevate Nim to human status, but it does, at times, reduce the humans to primate social groups, with dominant males and nurturing females. Nim may be ruled by the desire for instant gratification, but so are the researchers, is the implication.\n\nBoth films tell us something about human nature, but they tell us more about how our view of that nature, and that potential, has changed since 1798 and since 1970. And not for the better.\n\n————\n\nWritten under a Creative Commons License, with edits: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/###"}
{"prompt": "How does the way an exhibition is curated affect the viewer's experience and understanding of the art on display?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Some of the earliest art exhibitions gathered together selections of the greatest works they could find, without particular concern for coherence. The vast Manchester Art Treasures exhibition of 1857 is the exemplar, with a panoply of masterpieces largely from British aristocratic collections. These displays offered public entertainment without pedagogic purpose. Later in the nineteenth century, art history became more professional, with expert curators like von Bode in Berlin. A particular focus was on attribution, and exhibitions were staged to permit comparison between works attributed to particular artists to facilitate the task of separating works by an artist from those of his or her studio, or by followers or even forgers.\n\nToday this kind of connoisseurship is often frowned upon and is disdained as elitist in certain academic circles. In some museums, traditional displays organised by chronology and geography have been rejected for themes, gathering together landscapes and portraits irrespective of when, where or by whom they were painted. Curators seek to make museums as accessible as possible; anyone can already see that a painting is a landscape, but it requires some knowledge to identify it as a seventeenth century Dutch landscape by Ruisdael. Thematic arrangement might make it easier to relate to when you come in from the street, but the problem is that you go back to the street with no new knowledge or understanding. It flatters the untutored eye, but it offers no tuition. This approach condescends to the lay visitor by assuming that they lack interest or ability to develop critical faculties and increase knowledge.\n\nBronze is a thematic display that includes great masterpieces, and it is an absolute stinker. The immediately striking problem is the lighting. Spotlights add a degree of drama, particularly to the larger bronzes like the copy of Cellini’s ‘Perseus’, but militate against appreciation of the art by permitting us to see only a fraction of the whole. It privileges immediate sensation over relaxed contemplation, the impact of the whole over the appreciation of the parts. Some of the smaller bronzes are hardly visible. Worst of all is Vries’ ‘Hercules, Nessus and Deianira’ which is high up on a pedestal and scarcely lit at all.\n\nSculptures designed to be seen in the round are placed against walls, and some of the smaller bronzes are placed at the back of deep pedestals, making them hard to see at all. It is particularly tragic to see some of the loans from the Victoria and Albert Museum, which is walkable from the Royal Academy. At the V&A, they were in daylight and could be seen in the round, with no admission charge; for the duration of this exhibition, you have to pay £14 to see them as shadowy ghosts. I am grateful for the guards’ forbearance of my use of a torch, which made it possible to see so much that was otherwise not visible. I was careful to avoid disturbing other visitors, but I found groups congregating around me, amazed at what they were unable to see with the mean lighting provided at the RA.\n\nThe presentation is stupid. There is no nicer word for it. It is a meaningless hodgepodge of works from vastly different civilizations across time and space. Nothing is gained from showing late twentieth century abstract expressionist Kooning next to Italian renaissance Ghiberti. The catalogue explains that the thematic display was intended to dissuade people from concentrating on the periods they already know best, like the Italian renaissance. But it has the opposite effect. Each exhibit is stranded without context. Because the exhibition provides no context or meaning, we are forced back on what we already know. A display of bronzes from Benin, or from ancient China, may engage me and help me to understand less familiar traditions. Sticking them randomly with classical and renaissance bronzes brought together because they all depict animals makes me focus more on the things I know better. It was only after I left that I realised just how one-sided I had concentrated on the familiar, without particularly intending to do so. Instructive comparisons emerge by happenstance, such as between ancient and renaissance bronzes. But even here the fact of their being cast in bronze is incidental; marble sculptures could show the same effect.\n\nThe problems are replicated in the catalogue. Chapters cover recognisable art historical categories rather than themes, allegedly to provide a balance with the exhibition, but I suspect in practice because there is so little to say about bronze animals across history. The essays are good, but inevitably too brief to do justice to vast spans of art history, and they struggle to focus on bronze because they have to provide context on the wider culture. The illustrations are poor quality and the catalogue entries are a travesty—just a few hundred words each, squeezed in at the back. They can only hint at context, condition, and attribution.\n\nBronze is still an exhibition you should make every effort to see. The quality of the exhibits is astonishing and some rarely seen works are on display. There are ‘Oh My God’ moments around every corner, as yet another obscure masterpiece is revealed. Pierino da Vinci’s ‘The Death of Count Ugolino della Gheradesca and His Sons’ is a work of genius, but still little-known, as it was only recently rediscovered. One of my favourite sculptors is Adriaen de Vries, but his work is not easily accessible. His Forge of Vulcan from Munich is a remarkable tour-de-force, a deep relief of great virtuosity. Several of the classical bronzes are also of the very highest quality, and it was a treat to see them alongside those from the Renaissance. But the exhibition is less than the sum of its parts, and I left feeling cheated. It obscured more than it revealed and I learned nothing from the display.\n\nHow different is the lovely Raphael show in Haarlem. It is a small, select display of drawings primarily from two old collections, the Albertina in Vienna and the Teylers Museum in Haarlem. Three of the drawings at the Teylers Museum have recently been re-attributed to Raphael, and the exhibition gives context to these works.\n\nA video explains the principles of attributing drawings to Raphael, and has a debate between the two curators about a drawing’s attribution, one favouring Raphael and the other favouring his school. The format is unfortunate; it seems to have been designed by someone working in children’s television. The voting buttons at the end are an absurd gimmick that detract from the seriousness of curatorial intent, reducing connoisseurship to a popularity contest. But the idea of engaging a general audience in the process of attribution is inspired.\n\nThe drawings are magnificent. Seeing originals by both Raphael and his best students reveals the master’s unique genius far more clearly than reproductions, which tend particularly to flatter artists like Penni and Giulio Romano. The exhibition covers the whole of Raphael’s short career, from the wonderful early sketches for several versions of the ‘Madonna and Child’, capturing an astonishing range of emotion with a few pen strokes, to the masterful studies for the Transfiguration, surely amongst the best drawings in the whole history of art.\n\nPersonally, I was convinced of only one of the three re-attributions, the excellent ‘Putto with the Attributes of Vulcan’. The ‘Portrait of a Young Man’ is damaged, so judgement must be more provisional, but its quality does not convince. The hatching is more mechanical than the ‘St Paul’, and the hands are oddly emphasised (perhaps partly an issue of conservation), with corrections that seem atypical, although the foreshortening is skillful. ‘Joshua Addressing the Israelites at Shechem’ is also too damaged for confident attribution, though it is plausible. The ‘Three Female Heads’ is disputed between the curators, but it reflects neither Raphael’s working practice nor his genius. The hatching of the upper two heads is accomplished, but the overall effect is less good than Raphael, an indication of a talented copyist who can replicate the parts without capturing the spirit of the whole\n\nThe booklet provided is useful. No dry technical guide, it conveys a real sense of excitement and offers qualitative judgments. It provides useful information that is so often lacking in museums, such as detail about the condition. The superb accompanying catalogue amplifies these points and has fine quality reproductions. Experiencing this exhibition makes clear that the process of engaging in questions of attribution is not an arcane antiquarian pursuit—it is a lively and dynamic engagement with art that trains us to appreciate artistic excellence and recognise gradations of quality. Not everyone has the time to devote to become an expert connoisseur, and we are blessed with varying degrees of natural aptitude. But we can all engage at some level and emerge with a better appreciation of art. The process is so much more rewarding than scattering art loosely related to a common theme.\n\nSeeing these two exhibitions within a couple of days of each other was a fascinating contrast in museological approach. Bronze aims to entertain, to impress, and even to overwhelm with its accumulation of great works. But it deadens the soul with poor display and foolish presentation. In every respect Raphael is the more worthy exhibition. It shows that connoisseurship is not just for the cognoscenti. It invites visitors into a wider conversation about art, rather than condescending to them. It is more than the sum of its parts—its purpose is to educate and to enlighten, and I think every visitor will come away enriched and invigorated.\n\n——\n\nWritten under a Creative Commons License, with edits: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/###"}
{"prompt": "What are the differences between good and bad bosses?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Everyone knows how important it is to have favorable conditions at the workplace. Starting from trivial things such as air conditioners or coolers with fresh water, and ending up with flexible schedules and good relationships with colleagues—all this, as well as many other factors, impact employees’ productivity and quality of work. In this regard, one of the most important factors is the manager, or the boss, who directs the working process. It is not a secret that bosses are often a category of people difficult to deal with: many of them are unfairly demanding, tyrannic, prone to shifting their responsibilities to other workers, and so on. At the same time, there are many bosses who not only manage to maintain their staff’s productivity at high levels, but also treat them nicely, fairly, with understanding, and are pleasant to work with. Let us try to figure out the differences between good and bad managers, or bosses.\n\nThere are numerous cases when a boss sees his or her staff as personal attendants. The scales of this attitude can vary: some bosses may from time to time ask an employee to bring them a cup of coffee—this is tolerable, and in many cases this can be evaluated as a friendly favor a coworker would do for another coworker without feeling inferior or exploited. However, there are managers whose personal demands go far beyond friendly requests. Highly qualified workers sometimes have to face humiliating demands; for example, Jennifer (the name is changed)—a finance executive in a big company—had to dress up like a Japanese woman, because her boss demanded her to do so. Or, another victim of unfair chief-subordinate relationships, Marisa, had to stay in the office late after work, because her boss required her to (attention!) trim his ear hair (Everwise).\n\nA “good” boss would obviously not treat his or her subordinates like this. Respecting their feelings, dignity, and personal space, such a boss would not demand colleagues to do personal favors, making use of a higher position in a company’s hierarchy. As it has been mentioned before, asking for a cup of coffee or some other small favor can be tolerable if it does not harm a worker’s productivity and/or somehow infringes upon their dignity. Such favors are often made by subordinate employees for each other, and probably cannot be evaluated as exploitation. Things like those described in the previous paragraph, however, go far beyond a friendly attitude, and feel more like exploitation.\n\nThere are bosses who are typical “emotional vampires.” These people are extremely difficult to work with, and even though they may possess traits necessary for performing their duties excellently, their subordinates usually suffer severe stress because of their bosses’ psychological peculiarities. According to the clinical psychologist Albert Bernstein, vampires fall under four categories: anti-socials, who pursue excitement in all of its forms; obsessive-compulsives, who meticulously seek for the slightest flaws in their subordinates’ work and micromanage everything; histrionics, who need other people’s attention, and narcissists, who believe they are the most spectacular, valuable, and professional employees in the company (Everwise). Each of these types can be emotionally dangerous for employees. For example, anti-social bosses may provoke conflicts within the office environment, and then enjoy the emotional dramas following up; narcissists will criticize everything and everyone, never satisfied with the work their subordinates do, but never “stooping low enough” to organize it in such a way that benefits everyone; obsessive-compulsive bosses can drive employees crazy with trying to handle and regulate every little detail of the working process—implementing rules for ridiculous things like how sharp should pencils be, or what angle monitors should be. It does not mean that emotional vampires do it on purpose: rather often, such traits are subconscious behavioral patterns, but this still does not make employees’ lives easier.\n\nA “good boss,” on the contrary, does not try to regulate everything, or put himself or herself on a pedestal. Such a person is supportive, knows the weak and the strong professional traits of each of his or her subordinates, listens to what staff has to say (and not just listens, but cares about implementing good ideas), encourages personnel, and cares not just about the work done but also about the team in general and about each of the team’s members. “Bad” bosses may be highly competent in the latest theories regarding their field of work, but it is the skill to manage personnel, to inspire rather than to enforce, which makes yet another difference between the good and the bad boss (Developing People). And even though it is important for a manager to care about the tasks his or her team must accomplish, a good manager will always consider the capabilities and skills of his or her team, instead of blatantly demanding results without regarding how people in the team feel.\n\nAll this does not mean that a good boss is one who is nice and tender to his or her subordinates, and a bad boss is one who demands too much, though. In fact, a “good” boss can possess all the traits of a “bad” one: he or she can criticize, yell, or force people to do a lot of work within a short period of time, for example. However, it is the sense of limits that makes the difference. Robert Sutton, a professor of management at Stanford University, says that: “The best bosses have that ability to sort of turn up the volume, to be pushy, to get in people’s faces when they need it, maybe to give them some negative feedback, and to back off when it’s the right time to do that as well. We want people leading us who are confident, who are competent, who act like they’re in charge, who make firm decisions, but we don’t want to work for arrogant, pigheaded bastards who can’t take input. And so what you end up with is sort of this challenge—what great bosses do is find a way to walk the line between these two things” (Business Insider). In other words, many of the “nasty” things “bad” bosses do can be done by “good” bosses as well, but a “good” boss uses such tactics only when it is necessary and knows when to stop being pushy—unlike “bad” bosses, who know no other manner of management.\n\nThe relationships between bosses and their employees greatly affect the productivity and the quality of work within any company—this is why it is important that these relationships are, if not friendly, then at least constructive and respectful. Unfortunately, not all managers know how to treat their personnel well. There are traits that indicate a bad boss with almost 100% accuracy: such bosses often treat their subordinates as personal attendants, are demanding, pushy, and offensive for no real reason, or may let their negative traits of character loose, turning the life of regular employees into psychological hell (as in the case of emotional vampires). On the contrary, good bosses treat their subordinates with respect, consider their emotions and professional capabilities, care about teamwork, try to inspire employees instead of forcing them to do something, and even when they need to be pushy and harsh, such bosses always know when to stop.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the differences between Photoshop and Illustrator?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The 21st century is the age of visual information. Wherever you look, you will be surrounded by all kinds of graphics, charts, commercials, logos, banners, and other images. Be it a website, a billboard, a magazine, a comic book, a package—all the images are created by graphic designers: people whose profession is to draw. Unlike usual artists, graphic designers mostly work with customers, creating images based on their specific requirements; there is also one more difference: instead of a canvas, pencils, and dyes, graphic designers utilize special software programs. Among the most popular and the most advanced programs, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator are the favorites of the majority of graphic designers. Many people who want to learn about this software from scratch face the most basic question: which program to start studying, and what are the differences between Photoshop and Illustrator?\n\nThe most basic difference probably lies in the principles each of these programs operates with. Photoshop works with raster graphics. What does it mean? A raster image consists of pixels, each emitting the light of three main colors: red, green, and blue (the so-called RGB standard). The mixture of these three colors provides all the range of colors our monitors can display. When all the pixels in a certain area of a screen shine at their maximum capacity, this area will appear white; less intensity gives darker shades, up to black. The main limitation of raster graphics is that pixels cannot maintain their appearance as the image becomes larger; for this reason, when you zoom into a raster image, it becomes blurry. Unlike Photoshop, Illustrator operates with vector graphics—this means that the way an image is rendered is defined by mathematical formulas, the variables in which a designer inserts by using Illustrator’s tools (PsPrint). For example, a curved line drawn in Photoshop will consist of pixels; its shape and borders are defined by the way a designer brushed over the “canvas,” and when you enlarge it, pixels will be able to sustain the shape of the drawn object only until a certain limit—after you surpass it, the image will become blurry. In Illustrator, the shape of the line is derived from the coordinates set by a designer’s drawing tool. Respectively, when you enlarge such an image, it will not lose its quality, because pixels have nothing to do with the image’s creation here (although your monitor still uses them to display the result of the mathematical calculations behind the image).\n\nPhotoshop is unparalleled in terms of creating realistic, nature-like images. A skilled designer can create a Photoshop illustration that will look incredibly realistic, to the extent that it is difficult to distinguish it from reality; besides, Photoshop can edit already existing images with great precision—how many times have you looked at a celebrity’s photo in a magazine and wondered, which part of it is “natural,” and which is edited? The only drawbacks here are that a designer working in Photoshop must have initial images to work with, and also the scale: after a certain threshold, the image will pixelate and inevitably lose quality. Illustrator cannot match with Photoshop in terms of realism or editing capabilities, however Illustrator’s main purpose is creating brand new images from scratch, and designing all kinds of elements which must look perfect under any conditions. For example, a company’s logo will most likely be created in Illustrator, since whatever scale it is set to, it will always retain its shape and other properties. Illustrator is widely used for creating brand books, corporate style, fonts, packages, and other similar production (Designcontest.com). Although all this does not mean that a talented designer cannot use each of these programs however he or she likes.\n\nShortly speaking, raster graphics (and respectively, Photoshop) is better to use when working with photos; vector graphics, on the other hand, is required when you need to create an illustration from scratch (PsPrint).\n\nBoth Adobe programs—Photoshop and Illustrator—are the most convenient and essential tools for any graphic designer. The main difference between them lies in the principles they work with: Photoshop operates with raster graphics, and Illustrator utilizes vector graphics; based on the advantages and shortcomings of these principles, the purposes these programs are used for also differ: Photoshop is mainly used for editing and image post-processing, and illustrator is great for drawing, creating images from scratch. A skilled designer uses both of these programs to achieve incredible results.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the differences between Tokyo and Kyoto?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In recent decades, the title of one of the most popular cultures worldwide should be definitely given to Japan. Millions of people all over the world study the Japanese language, watch dorama (dramatic TV series on all kinds of topics) or animation, read and write haiku, and make pen pals with Japanese people. Countless people buy tickets and fly to the country of the rising sun to see its wonders with their own eyes.\n\nAmong the most popular destinations—mostly because these city names are most known to the western public—are Tokyo and Kyoto. And perhaps for an inexperienced traveler, there is a dilemma: where to go? Mostly, people know that Tokyo is a mega city of the future, and Kyoto has more to do with ancient culture, traditions, and so on. Basically it is true, but at the same time, there also exist more subtle differences one should consider when choosing their destination point in Japan.\n\nThe first of them is prices. Tokyo is expensive—as you might expect from the capital of the most urbanized country in the world (the prices below are listed in Japanese yen: 1 USD approximately equals 100 yen). So, to grab some inexpensive snack in Tokyo would cost around 850 yen. Having a three-course meal for two people in a mid-range restaurant, in case you travel with your spouse, will cost you 5,230 yen. A one-way ticket on Tokyo transport costs you 190 yen, and renting one room apartment outside of the city center costs 77,853 yen (and this is probably a weekly price). Just do not expect this apartment to be big and cozy; most likely it will be tiny, with basic utilities, and with no central heating (actually, there is no such thing in Japan at all—everyone warms their house up on their own). If you think of buying an apartment in Tokyo, forget it—one square meter of a room outside of the city center is around 1 million yen (double the price if you want to live closer to the city center).\n\nKyoto is not much cheaper. Although dining in a restaurant is cheaper—only 4,000 yen for two persons in a mid-range restaurant—transportation costs are surprisingly higher: 235 yen for a ride (however, if you want to purchase a monthly pass, it is cheaper to do in Kyoto rather than in Tokyo: 8,410 yen compared to 10,000 yen). If you think you can save some money buying food in a market, you are correct only in particulars: some products in Japan cost a lot of money no matter where you buy them. For example, white rice costs 850 yen for 1 kg in Kyoto (453 yen in Tokyo). White bread, tomatoes, chicken breasts, and especially cheese—these are the most expensive products both in Kyoto and in Tokyo. Speaking of accommodation, renting or buying an apartment in Kyoto is much cheaper: for a one room apartment outside of Kyoto’s center, you must pay 48,000 yen to rent, or 300,000 yen per square meter if you want to buy it (Numbeo.com).\n\nTokyo is great to visit if you enjoy hustle and bustle, if you want to feel the heartbeat of a mega-city, dive into its life, and experience all those crazy things people in the West usually tell about Japan. Be prepared for the overcrowded subway— and “overcrowded” is a gentle way to put it; in fact, you can take a 60-minute ride in the subway, and your feet will not even touch the floor, because you will be squeezed between other people so tight that you can even take a nap in this position. Kyoto, on the other hand, is good to visit for all those who feel inspired by traditional Japanese culture: haiku, hanami, court customs, the No theater, and so on. In Kyoto, you will not see amazing skyscrapers, over 280 subway stations, and the craziness of the famous Shibuya crossing; instead, get prepared for temples, tea houses, museums: all things antique and authentic. But, if you want modernity, go to Tokyo, and you will not feel disappointed—this city already lives in the future (Go Overseas).\n\nIt is difficult to say which city is better for an inexperienced tourist to visit, Tokyo or Kyoto. Kyoto is cheaper, especially in terms of renting an apartment, and is more suitable for those looking for the old Japanese culture weaved into sophisticated palaces made during Heian-jidai. Tokyo, on the contrary, is an enormous metropolis, with crazy prices, crazy transportation, crazy everything. The atmospheres are different, but both of the cities will make you awed, so if you have a chance, you should definitely visit them.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the differences between the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The hype around Apple products seems neverending. The company’s announcement of a new product collects millions of views; people stand lines in front of Apple stores to get a new gadget—just to come at the same place twelve months later, longing for a new product. Among the company’s recent novelties is the iPhone 6—a newer and more advanced version of the most popular phone in the world. However, the previous model—iPhone 5s—seemed to have been satisfying people’s needs fine as well. So, what is the difference? Is the iPhone 6 worth spending extra money on it?\n\nThe most obvious difference is that the new iPhone has got a bigger and wider display—it is now 4.7 inches in diagonal, compared to the 4 inches that its predecessor possessed. The new model has a larger resolution, which is 1334 x 750. The technology used in the screen is called “Retina HD,” and is known to be one of the best (if not the best) screen technologies, allowing to transfer deep, saturated, and realistic colors. iPhone 5s had nothing like that in its arsenal. Both phones have strengthened glass covering the display, but the 6th model also possesses an improved polarizer.\n\nThe overall design has not changed much, putting aside the fact that the iPhone 6 is bigger. It is thinner (6.8mm thick, compared to  the 7.9mm of the previous model), and slightly lighter; the differences are so subtle, however, that they are not worth mentioning. Both models are made of aluminium, and have the distinctive round button at the bottom. Currently, hundreds of tech observers bend over themselves trying to prove that iPhone 6 is much more comfortable to use, that it fits a hand of an average person perfectly, and so on. However, all these observers are probably male. iPhone 5s, although having a smaller screen, fits hands of women and teenagers, whereas the new model reminds of a shovel, or of an average Samsung phone: okay to use if you are a man with a large hand, but not comfortable for women.\n\nThe hardware differences between iPhone 5s and iPhone 6 are also not obvious to a normal user (given that this user is not a tech nerd). iPhone 6 uses a 64-bit Apple A8 dual-core, whereas the older model has the A7 one. Both models have 1GB RAM on board. iPhone 6 also has an M8 co-processor (M7 co-processor in the iPhone 5s). Both models work fine with iOS 8. Both cameras are traditionally perfect for semi-professional use. iPhone 6 works about 10 hours in talk mode, and this result is a little bit better than the previous model with 8 hours of battery life on talk mode.\n\nBoth phones are high-quality products, able to satisfy the needs of anyone who uses them. If you are not a geek who cares about processor frequencies, or a designer who has the eye to distinguish all the CMYK color range, there is no need for you to update from your iPhone 5s.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of alternative medicine?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The progress of science is usually believed to have improved the quality of many processes, products, and services. However, in certain spheres of life, traditional methods are still being used; medicine is a bright example of the co-existence of two antipodal approaches. Along with commonly recognized conventional medicine based on science and technology, there also exists alternative medicine, which sometimes includes practices developed thousands of years ago. The superiority of each of these kinds of medicine have a long-standing history, as each of them have proved its effectiveness; therefore, understanding their advantages and drawbacks is crucial for forming one’s own point of view.\n\nThe first difference between these two systems is their approach to diagnosis. Conventional medicine focuses on the factors that cause diseases and remedying their symptoms; every abnormality is seen as an independent clause, separate from the personality of an individual and their environment. Unlike its counterpart, alternative medicine sees a body as an equilibrium of interrelations between a body and its environment; therefore, a disease is thought to be caused by an imbalance between them. In other words, alternative medicine focuses rather on cleansing the entire system than on curing its particular elements (Buzzle).\n\nAlternative medicine assumes health is a life-long process; therefore, to sustain a healthy body condition, a person should continually maintain proper nutrition, their daily regimen, body care, mind exercises, and so on. Conventional medicine, while also taking these principles in consideration, relies mostly on drugs and surgery. This makes it more effective for managing critical situations (or for quick-fixes), but is less efficient in healing chronic diseases. In addition, it is extremely expensive. On the other hand, alternative medicine is more affordable, it guarantees stronger and more stable results, but is also time-intensive, requiring a commitment to a healing process, and thus may not seem like a reasonable option for quickly healing a patient (AHHA).\n\nUnlike conventional medicine, which relies entirely on chemically synthesized drugs, alternative medicine uses natural components such as herbs as remedying substances. Alternative medicine also uses ancient methods of dealing with diseases, such as acupuncture, massage, yoga, breathing techniques, meditation, and so on. Conventional medicine, in its turn, puts more trust in scientifically-approved methods of diagnosing and treatment, though acupuncture and massage are also approved (AlternativeMedicine).\n\nAlternative and conventional medicine have different approaches when it comes to understanding and curing diseases. Whereas conventional medicine often sees a disease as an independent clause, and focuses more on a quick-fix than on systematic approaches, alternative medicine sees a body and its environment as a holistic system; a disease occurs in case of an imbalance between all of the system’s elements. Conventional medicine is thus more effective for treating critical situations, but less suitable for managing chronic diseases. Alternative medicine yields gradual results, but they are usually more stable and long-lasting, as they often involve the change of an individual’s lifestyle. Alternative medicine relies mostly on natural components and ancient techniques, whereas conventional medicine prefers chemical drugs and scientifically-approved methods of diagnosis and treatment.###"}
{"prompt": "How does globalization affect the practice of yoga?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In my opinion, one of the most significant aspects of 21st century life is the inevitable process of globalization. Its opponents claim it contributes to nations losing their distinctiveness—and they are right to some extent. But, on the other hand, globalization has also helped people access the cultural heritage of other nations, and thus enrich their own. Discovering the East aided western people in looking at life from a different perspective; new spiritual conceptions, martial arts, and the knowledge about esoteric medicine are just a few boons gained by western civilization after contact with the East. Meditation and various yoga systems are also among these gains. However, as it often happens, they have quickly become a mass cultural phenomenon; thus, they were made commercial, simplified, and adjusted to the needs and pace of life of an average westerner. Therefore, traditional yoga systems and those taught in the West differ significantly.\n\nTo start with, western yoga is strongly focused on postures (asanas) and breath. Advertisements on the Internet often include an image of a man or a woman sitting in the Lotus Posture, or in some other asana, which obviously requires being in shape. Searching on Google proves that yoga is often seen only as a variation of fitness; questions like “What is better: yoga or pilates for losing weight?” illustrate this thesis. Besides, unlike eastern yoga, where a great focus is made on being attentive to yourself and to your body signals, in the West, yoga classes often incorporate such elements as music or gymnastics. Though this is often made to make classes look diverse and attract new customers, it makes for a great distracting factor for practitioners (Bhagwan Sri Aditi Akash). This takes yoga away from its meditative aspects and turns it into another form of fitness.\n\nThe slogan of the entire western world could be “Better, higher, stronger,” since this principle helps people to function and survive in its competitive environment. Unfortunately, this attitude works even for yoga, where the instructor can force the practitioners to “flip through poses at lightning speed” during one training session (MindOnTravel). Considering many people also try to practice yoga postures on their own, guided only by tutoring videos on YouTube and the aforementioned slogan, such training mostly does harm instead of being beneficial: the number of yoga-related emergency room visits increases each year (Azcentral.com).\n\nEastern, or traditional yoga, embraces another approach. Western yoga almost makes a cult out of asanas and breathing techniques; people start to set goals for themselves, such as being able to sit in the Lotus Posture, for example, and this takes them away from the true meaning of yoga practices. Traditional yoga sees postures only as methods of returning to the inner self, comprehending our own essence. Sometimes the easier an asana is, the deeper it can take a practitioner into meditation; there were cases when people experienced sudden insights while simply lying on a floor during their yoga classes. While for westerners, asanas become a way to reach a close-to-perfect physical shape, in the East, health and the ideal body condition often are side effects of a deeper practice of self-exploration and meditating (Bhagwan Sri Aditi Akash).###"}
{"prompt": "What are the arguments of both evolutionists and creationists?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " After Sir Charles Darwin introduced his original theory about the origins of species and evolution, humanity’s faith in God, which remained undisputed for hundreds of years, had reeled. The former unity fractured into evolutionists, who believed life as we see it today developed from smaller and more primitive organisms, and creationists, who kept believing life in all its diversity was created by a higher entity. Each side introduced substantial arguments to support their claims, but at the same time, the counter-arguments of each opponent were also credible. Therefore, the debates between the evolutionists and the creationists seem to be far from ending. And though their arguments are completely opposite, they can coexist and even complement each other.\n\nEvolutionists often come with the argument about fossil findings serving as a proof of the evolutionary process; bones of such creatures as dinosaurs, or the remains of even more ancient beings found by archaeologists are much older than the age of our world according to the Bible. Therefore, claim the evolutionists, creationists are wrong. Creationists, however, came up with a strong counter argument. They say all fossil findings are already fully formed, and appear to have not changed much over time; in other words, they remained in a stasis condition (Geological Society of America). This means there are no intermediate links between simpler and more complex life forms, which witnesses in favor of the claim of each species having been created.\n\nEvolutionists—as well as atheists—state, despite the enormous scientific and technological progress, despite ultra-sensitive observation systems, such as orbital telescopes, there are still no factual evidence of God’s existence. At the same time, creationists appeal to the fact that though God has not yet been heard or seen, a multitude of indirect evidence exists of its existence. For example, creationists name an incredible complexity both of living organisms, and the ecosystems they inhabit. The compound eyes of night creatures are extremely difficult to develop, especially on their own. Ecosystems function in such a way that the absence, even of several smallest components, causes the ruin of the environment. It is difficult to believe such complexity and diversity appeared and established balance on its own, whereas evolutionists suggest the idea of random development through survival of the fittest.\n\nEvolutionists believe over time, the matter that formed our universe shaped out into stars, planets, chemicals, and finally, living organisms. According to evolutionists, before the Big Bang, there existed nothing (or at least what could be observed with our laws of physics), but after it, the matter self-organized in ordered structures, which become even more structured and organized as time flowed on. Surprisingly, creationists refer to science to oppose this thesis. They say that, according to the second law of thermodynamics, everything, be it living creatures, chemicals, or substances, tend to blend and mix with their environment over time, finally reaching the steady-state, which does not happen in nature (BestBibleScience.com).\n\nAt the same time, both sides seem to forget one point of view that does not necessarily contradict another one. It is possible God could have planned everything, prepared certain elements for the universe’s development, and then just pressed a metaphysical “Start” button, letting its ideas self-embody, watching the results. Or, God could have created the possibility of life, but after this, it could leave this life to find its own ways. Besides these, many other compromise variants can be suggested; anyways, it is ridiculous in the debate about the most complex and incomprehensible subject in the world if only two points of view exist.\n\nThe clash between evolutionists and creationists seems to be far from its finale. Both sides come up with potent arguments in favor of their positions. Evolutionists stress the absence of factual evidence in favor of God’s existence, point to fossils as a proof of the evolutionary process, and name the Big Bang as the reason of the universe’s appearance and further development. Creationists, in their turn, stress there are no intermediate links between species in found fossils, consider complexity and diversity of nature to be an indirect evidence of God’s existence, and refer to the second law of thermodynamics to argue against the Big Bang theory. However, none of these sides seem to see how both points of view can not only coexist, but be successfully combined. Such a combination could explain everything at once.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the main differences between hospitals today and a century ago?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Medicine has a history spanning many thousands of years and specialized establishments for treating the sick have also existed for eons. Despite the fact that function of hospitals have not changed much during the last century, technological and scientific progress has made possible treatment approaches that could not have been implemented a hundred years ago and made a large contribution to health care. The main differences between hospitals today and a century ago are improved surgical techniques, the safer use of anesthesia, and safer childbirth procedures.\n\nToday, many people take anesthesia for granted and cannot imagine surgery without local or complete analgesia. Anesthetics are widely-used, and oftentimes, even minor surgery is done with the mandatory application of these drugs. They have become significantly less dangerous, and the control over their usage is applied effectively. This can be attributed to the invention of the re-breathing circuit by Ralph Waters, which facilitated the application of artificial ventilation during surgery (Stephen 24).\n\nAnother significant achievement of modern hospitals is quality supervision over pregnancy. Today, a woman giving birth can reasonably presume both she and her child will undergo a healthy process from pregnancy to birth. This has become possible due to the new and progressive ways of monitoring the status of a mother and her fetus. For instance, most modern hospitals, with the help of electronic means, can survey a baby’s heartbeats using an internal device positioned directly on the fetus’s head which measures the electrical current produced by the heart (Stephen 26). The cesarean section rate today is approximately 30% in the United States and some birth procedures used in the past century have been revealed as ineffective and have ceased (Berkowitz 210). The adoption of new childbirth technology not only mitigates any risk that might have led to loss of life or disability a century ago, but assures an almost perfect outcome.\n\nThese positive changes can be attributed to numerous scientific innovations, economic developments, and better administration policies. Also, decreased levels of illiteracy both of medical staff and patients should also be considered. Modern hospitals are exceptionally scientific and complex institutions and have introduced complex diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. Many hospitals have also broadened their services and have transformed into institutions offering health education, research, training, and disease surveillance (Haagen 193). Still, this does not mean modern hospitals do not face challenges. For example, hospitals, especially those in developing countries, continue to be plagued with shortages of hospital beds and other necessities (Haagen 201).\n\nAt the same time, a hundred years ago, health care had faced difficulties caused by the imperfection of treatment methods and drugs. Thus, using anesthesia during surgery a century ago was linked with danger, sometimes even greater than the surgical procedure itself. The most popular anesthetics were chloroform and ether, both administered over the patient’s mouth. This led them to fall into a condition of deep unconsciousness and many patients lost their lives as a result of overdose (Haagen 193).\n\nGiving birth to a child a hundred years ago was a challenge as difficult as today, but the situation was even more complicated due to the absence of modern painkillers and technologies. A lot of women underwent childbirth with trepidation, since they were aware of a mother, or baby, who had died during this process. Back then, the status of the fetus could be surveyed and monitored only by the means of a specially designed fetal stethoscope. Thus, it was difficult to predict how the fetus would develop, as well as prevent possible dangers for mother and child. Lots of women preferred to give birth at home, or just had no access to hospitals where they could have been taken care of. Although cesarean sections were used early in the twentieth century, the rate of recurrence was low.\n\nIn addition, it is important to remember that a hundred years ago, hospitals were far worse equipped and the presence of many diseases as well as the reasons that caused them were unknown to science. Illnesses that are now successfully cured with several injections of an appropriate drug could kill a person living a hundred years ago. Besides, sanitary conditions in cities and villages sometimes were awful and the methods of preventing and treating epidemics were less effective than today. On the other hand, diseases that would be resistant to drugs never, or rarely occurred and various types of viruses did not mutate at the rates they do today.\n\nIt should be emphasized that there has been a radical transformation in the way hospitals operate today compared to a century ago. Improvements in anesthetics administration has made surgery safer and new birth techniques employed by hospitals have facilitated a smooth child delivery procedure. Most of this can be attributed to new scientific innovations. Modern hospitals are not yet in the clear. They still face challenges, like the emergence of new diseases and a lack of adequate facilities, which hamper their efforts. When compared to hospitals that existed a hundred years ago though, modern hospitals have transformed greatly in how they deliver their services.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the differences between teenagers today and teenagers a hundred years ago?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Technological progress has boosted both mobility and industrial production levels, while globalization has enhanced communication around the world and made the exchange of socio-political ideologies possible. For example, one can refer to the political revolutions in different parts of the globe—the Arab Spring and the continuing political upheaval in Syria, in particular. Taking these, and many other factors into consideration, one could say that social processes today and those about a hundred years ago are almost incomparable. At the same time, particular social groups, such as teenagers, become overexposed to the effects of these socio-political and technological changes (Connors 129). This fact can be easily noticed when evaluating modern youths’ preoccupations, hobbies, and behavior, as well as analyzing how they use leisure time as compared to their counterparts a century ago.\n\nToday’s teenagers use many types of technological gadgets, such as computers, TV sets, smartphones, and tablets—both at school and at home. They also seem to be studying with the help of technology. Actually, the latter now sometimes takes the place that had traditionally been left to parents and teachers. This refers not only to teaching material, but also to social and communication skills. Young people have become one of the main target audiences for social media, and waste in an inordinate amount of time on social networks instead of using it to conduct more constructive activities (Connors 45).\n\nModern teenagers are also more educated than a hundred years ago. One of the effects of an easily accessed education is that the youth have become more dynamic and socially active. They now tend to question and test the norms and traditions of their society. By doing so, the youth have become a source of societal change in many countries—recall the boycotts of university students in different countries (Silling 256). Due to the fact that teenagers, a hundred years ago, lacked the access to quality education, they were not so active. Actually, they were more conservative and adhered to the social norms laid down by their society.\n\nTalking about the old times, teenagers a century ago had little or even no access to modern technology. They acquired knowledge from parents and through extensive reading, and used their free time helping their parents around the house, playing outdoors, and so on (Connors 67). Education back then was a facet of society that was not highly emphasized. Access to education was considered a privilege for male children; and besides, financial difficulties in many households did not allow parents to send their children to school.\n\nWith regard to girls, societal norms a century ago, in the main, would hardly allow them to perform the same roles as their male counterparts. Managing a household was considered an appropriate position for women; therefore, girls were mostly confined to the domestic sphere. However, movements around the globe, in more modern times, have helped alleviate the plight of girls and women, so that today’s female teenagers can freely explore the same opportunities and careers as young men.\n\nOne can notice significant differences between today’s teenagers and teenagers a century ago. Today’s youths are more accustomed to technology than their counterparts a hundred years ago; they are more educated compared to teenagers a century ago. There is also more gender equality in terms of access to opportunities among modern teenagers. The question now is what will happen to our youth in the next 100 years.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the main differences between the client-centered and cognitive behavioral approaches to counseling?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Modern-day psychology is equipped with a wide variety of therapies, techniques, and approaches based on different models and theories of human behavior and development. When it comes to counseling, it is useful to be armed with a selection of tools, so that a counselor’s professional arsenal allows them to be flexible and to apply different techniques based on the individual problems and situational needs of each client. But when it comes to most of the counseling models that a practitioner decides to set as the foundation of their work, both client-centered approaches and cognitive behavioral therapy are equally popular and widespread. Nevertheless, these theories are different, and their effectiveness comes from cardinally opposite sides of counseling.\n\nThe client-centered model, also sometimes referred to as person-centered, was developed by Carl Rogers around the middle of the twentieth century. Its main focus, as can be guessed from the name of the model, revolves around the clients themselves. Roger believed that it was the clients who knew the best way of dealing with their own problems, and by listening to the words of the clients during a consultation session, by reflecting their words and being emphatic, the therapist can help in the most effective way. Roger believed it to be important that the therapist try to understand the client in the best way, and constantly check whether their understanding and interpretation of the client’s words is the right one. The client-centered approach is also much about respecting the clients and their freedom to express themselves in the most comfortable way, while constantly showing regard, and tolerance, to encourage such free expressions. This model is a bright example of a non-directive approach: meaning that the therapist does not deliberately steer the client, or provoke them, to be more emotional.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy, on the contrary, uses directive consulting tools to control and guide, such as: asking questions. making interpretations. and directing client’s attention and emotional exertions. Some psychologists believe that cognitive behavioral therapy is rather manipulative, especially when compared to the client-centered model. However, this may be rather a surface judgement. Cognitive behavioral therapy has two components: cognitive therapies and behavioral therapies. Cognitive therapy is about how clients interpret the world around them, the environment and situations with which they are faced, and how these cognitive interpretations shape their emotional states and responses. Essentially, cognitive therapy focuses on thinking. It analyzes how and why the client thinks a certain way, and aims at changing these patterns to form positive, nurturing, emotional states that can replace the current state of disharmony that the client is facing. Behavioral therapy is, in a way, the next stage. It focuses on actions rather than thoughts, and equips the therapist with effective tools to form new behavioral patterns for a client by stimulating certain positive “rewards” (emotional, such as praise and encouragement), for the positive changes in behavior that the client demonstrates when encountering a certain problem.\n\nWhen comparing the two models, it may seem that the role of the therapist is a lot less important in the client-centered model than in the cognitive behavioral therapy. However, this impression is far from being true. In fact, the client-centered approach is much about how the therapist encourages the client to open up by showing congruence. Being congruent means being self-aware, self-accepting, and having no mask between oneself and the client (Janon 28). The therapist is to be as honest and natural as possible, while showing sincere empathy, and nurturing the client’s inner capacity towards healing. Being appreciative of the honesty and hard work that the client is demonstrating, from session-to-session, will eventually bring fruitful results. However, this may take time, and when using the client-centered model, the therapist should be prepared that counselling may be rather prolonged.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy, on the contrary, is usually used as a short-term treatment method. By actively engaging in the dialogue with the client and encouraging the client to develop a challenging attitude towards their own thoughts and feelings, even giving homework assignments and asking the client to keep a diary, the cognitive behavioral approach usually allows one to quickly see positive improvement, and gradually progress towards the desired goal. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also more structured and goal-oriented, and it allows the client and the therapist to work together towards the specific set aims, step-by-step (Norman 201). Tracking progress towards goals throughout the course of treatment allows one to fairly evaluate the success of the sessions, as well serving as an additional motivating factor for the client to believe in the reality of positive changes by putting checkmarks next to each of the small achievements.\n\nWithout close examination, the two models of counselling may seem like completely contrary methods. It is in fact true that there are a lot of differences between the two approaches, and it can clearly be seen through the above analysis. Nevertheless, the main foundations for both kinds of therapy are similar. They both concentrate on forming a mutual understanding and a cooperative atmosphere between the therapist and the client, while assuring the latter that it is the clients themselves who are the best experts on their own issues. Both models allow the client to actively participate in the process of healing, and in the case of the client-centered model, to even take the leading and controlling role in this process. For all these reasons, I believe it is important that a prudent therapist is properly armed with both concepts and is able to choose either one or the other based on how far the client already is towards regaining control of their own life.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the benefits of travelling over staying at home for vacation?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Staycations have become the most popular alternative to vacation travelling. This is most likely due to the fact that staying at home for the holidays is cheaper, safer, and easier (Richards, Temptations of Travelling). It only stands to reason that back-porch vacations and poolside holidays are becoming the new trend for middle-class Americans, especially in light of the recent economic crisis. However, there are some specific reasons why travelling will remain a better alternative, despite the cost issues and any possible inconveniences.\n\nGoing on a journey involves experiencing your own senses: seeing, touching, hearing, and smelling the new, unusual, and unique atmosphere of places you visit while on vacation. If someone described to you what a new ice cream flavor tastes like using a hundred words, but instead you could choose to try it yourself, would you have preferred the description or the experience of your own? It is the same with travelling. Unlike watching the Discovery Channel or National Geographic, reading about exotic places on somebody’s blog and watching even the most colorful and fun podcasts about travelling, visiting the place is ten times more powerful of an experience. In addition, you get to form your own opinion about what you see instead of just watching it through the eyes of a documentary director or through the lens of a photographer.\n\nLeaving to involve yourself in an adventure is arguably the best source of inspiration one could think of. Even if you have been to the chosen location for travel a few times already, the next time you visit it, the impressions you receive can be different, have a new spice or a fresh hint, since the weather, your mood, and the people you come across will be distinctive, and your impression of the place can change radically or become fuller and more holistic. To me, travelling brings new discoveries, whether they are revelations of environments or discoveries within myself. In this regard, travelling can be the best cure for depression, the feeling of inner perplexity, and fears for what the future may bring and where you are heading. Sometimes, a vacation to a place you have never been before or know little about can do more than just broaden your knowledge and inspire new emotions. It can change your whole life perspective and cause you to revise your life values (Howards, Destination Joy). It is no wonder that many people return from vacations as completely new persons and never return to their old lifestyles.\n\nTravelling means meeting new people. Unlike staycations that normally revolve around the same group of people you are already on good terms with, travelling brings together at times absolutely different people, from various cultures and backgrounds. Travelling is a chance to get to know others better and to learn to adjust to new traditions and other peoples’ lifestyle (Opus, The Social Road). While on the road, you can meet someone you would never get a chance to bump into if you stayed within your comfort zone, at home, or with a group of people you have known for ages. Travelling is a chance to make new friends and change the cycle of the everyday routine you have gotten trapped in over the years.\n\nThere is a place for discussion of whether travelling is worth the money you will spend on it or is it better to save up, spend your vacation at home, and stay within your comfort zone. Travelling may seem like a challenge at times—it needs a great deal of planning, a decent budget, and a certain enthusiasm and willingness to challenge yourself. But those who have the courage to follow their dreams and overcome obstacles will find a way to pursue a hobby they like. And if you feel that overwhelming desire to see a place far away, do not let the fears take over your dream. Having once traveled, you will most likely not ask yourself whether to spend your vacation at home or travel—staycations will not be an option.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the main differences between LCD and plasma TVs?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " We live in a world of choice. In each moment, we are presented with the opportunity to choose from an array of options. The truth is, though, that we do not always make our choices consciously. Sometimes, instead of choosing what is best for our personal requirements, we fall in the trap of commercial tricks and purchase a product we do not need. When we want to make a choice based on facts and objective reasoning exclusively, we need to methodically analyze and compare each product based on the criteria we value. In this essay, I will try to do that when choosing between the two most popular types of TVs: LCD and plasma. When entering the technical department of any supermarket or a high-tech store, many people ask themselves whether a LCD TV is better than a plasma TV, or vice versa. To answer this question, we need to compare the two products based on several relevant technical criteria.\n\nFrom a layman’s eye, LCD and plasma TVs may look alike; however, a keen eye will notice the difference between these sets. These differences permit customers to have a manifold of choices based on their particular requirements. A plasma display comprises of two glass panels packed in compartmentalized spaces, with many small plasma cells. Plasma cells are normally charged to a precise electrical voltage level (Kith, Plasma TV Components). On the other hand, an LCD display is comprised of aqueous crystals that are normally preset between two panels of glass (Reed, Architecture of the TV). Displays are further enhanced by utilizing electricity voltage on the LCD TV set panel.\n\nAs a result of such technical differences, a conclusion can be drawn that plasma TV sets are better in comparison to LCD TV sets when it comes to lighting (Howard, TV Comparisons: Modern). Also, many users have noted that plasma screens give an enhanced black color display as compared to LCD screens. In addition, a plasma TV affords better viewing angles.\n\nAnother crucial criterion to consider whenever we compare two products of everyday use is the pricing range. The price of any TV set depends on the display diameter and the stylistic configuration of the device. One may spend up to a million dollars on a TV set that was designed and custom made exclusively for their interior, and may even be inlaid with precious stones or a designer label. However, when we aim to compare two products based on their cost, we need to select two equally-sized, factory-made for mass consumption products of one or two popular brands, and compare their prices. An average plasma TV is cheaper than an LCD TV. This is largely due to the fact that a plasma TV costs less to assemble, thus translating into a lower price (Fields, Price Comparisons of Viewing). The price criterion once again speaks in favor of the plasma TV. At the same time, when taking the price factor into account, we have to understand its changeability. Since LCD TVs are a much more current technological invention than the plasma TV, there is a high possibility that the price of LCD products will decrease palpably in the near future, as technological progress offers us new alternatives.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the differences between Renaissance and Neoclassicism art periods?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Renaissance and Neoclassicism are two major periods in the history of art, during which different forms of art including architecture, painting, music, and visual arts significantly progressed. During these eras, many artists gained enormous fame as a result of the masterpieces they produced, reflecting how the ideologies and artistic philosophies evolved during that time. This essay compares and contrasts these two art periods with respect to the major works created by prominent artists. In this regard, the masterpiece David, created by Michelangelo has been compared with Antonio Canova’s statue Psyche Revived by Cupid’s Kiss. Both of these works reflect the artistic progression of their ages. David represents Renaissance art by reflecting the political situation of that time, whereas Psyche Revised by Cupid’s Kiss depicts the artist’s focus on classical Greek and Roman styles.\n\nThe Renaissance Era refers to a period of rebirth in art. It was a cultural movement that took place between the classical and modern periods of art (Johnson, 2005). During this phase, there were significant developments occurring within different art forms. The artists widely reflected the culture, social conditions, and political structure of their societies. They went beyond the boundaries of classical art, and created art with unconventional ideas, and depicted the political and social conditions of their societies (Earls, 1987).\n\nNeoclassicism, also called the Era of Enlightenment, is the period after the Renaissance, during which artists mainly focused on exploring and recreating classical art, especially Greek and Roman styles. During this period, the artists widely emphasized reviving the classic antiquity that highly inspired the art pieces created during this period. It was in reaction to peoples’ opposition to Romanticism (Bietoletti, 2009).\n\nThere are some renowned artists who made major contributions in the emergence and development of Renaissance art. For instance, Michelangelo is a notable name in the history of art, playing a vital role in the fruition of Renaissance art. He was an Italian painter, sculptor, and poet who adopted several unconventional styles of art and significantly contributed towards the progress of western art during this period. He introduced versatility within the art forms, and created several masterpieces that truly represent Renaissance art by depicting certain social, cultural, and political issues.\n\nAn important creation of Michelangelo’s during the Renaissance phase was the marble statue of a nude standing male named David. The statue was made to represent the biblical hero David who was one of the most favored subjects within Florentine art. The statue David depicts the political situation of the country. With a warning glare in the eye turned toward Rome, the statue symbolizes the defense of the civil liberty of the Florentine Republic that was threatened by the surrounding powerful states during that time. The statue is an excellent and renowned example of the Renaissance Era because it reflects the political and social conditions of that time.\n\nThe Neoclassicism Era also gave birth to many exemplary artists (Chilvers, 2004), including Antonio Canova, who was an Italian sculptor from the Republic of Venice. His art pieces indicate the return of art towards classical refinement. His statue Psyche Revised by Cupid Kiss is an important example of neoclassical devotion to love and reflection of intricate emotions. The statue shows the love god Cupid at the heights of tenderness and affection, kissing the lifeless Psyche to make it alive. The statue reflects the Roman style of portraying delicate emotions within art, for which it has been regarded as an example of the Neoclassical Movement.\n\n###"}
{"prompt": "How do the roles of defender and forward contribute to a soccer team's success?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Soccer is a fascinating sport for a myriad reasons: it has changing speeds, dynamics in the variety of player positions, and a hint of unpredictability where a twist of fate can turn the game around. Soccer is no doubt a team game—one can seldom score a goal by dribbling the ball across the field and getting it across the goal line alone. Every player contributes to the overall result—even those players sitting on the substitute bench can contribute to the general winning spirit of their team. Yet, despite the undoubted fact that soccer is a team game, there has consistently been the argument as to who contributes more to a win, and thus, which role is to be considered more valuable: is it the defender or the forward players? I believe it is incorrect to consider choosing between these two positions. To prove my point, it will be instructive to compare the two roles in detail.\n\nThe forward position is no doubt both exciting and fascinating. It is no secret that forward players are commonly the most popular names in the world of soccer, and are also usually sold to clubs at a much higher rate than players in any other position. After all, it is a forward in most cases who scores that longed-for goal and makes the whole stadium chant their name. Forwards also most often earn free kicks and penalties for their team by forcing the opposing player to commit a foul to stop the marauding striker from getting the ball across the goal line (Winston, Soccer’s Reality). Forwards are the most widely recognized, that even non-fans can identify them by face and name. Soccer fans themselves will, in the majority of cases, agree that forwards are the players who deserves, on-and-off the field, more than any other.\n\nHowever, there have been millions of soccer games where even the world’s top-ranked strikers have failed to score a goal because they seldom had the ball in their possession. When defenders play their role properly, there is no ball to get into the goal, no matter how great a forward is up front and how much he or she is willing to contribute. Forwards are rarely able to fall back to their half of the field to tackle for the ball, and still have the strength to bring it all the way to the opponent’s goal (Howards, Statistics of Soccer). It is the defenders who do the job of winning the ball for their team and sending it across to their forwards. It is also the defender who covers for the forward when the latter loses the ball and there is a danger of a fast counter-attack from the opposing side.\n\nDefenders have to be ready to make a sliding tackle—alert and ready to back up their teammates in the event of a mistake. Defenders themselves do not have the luxury of making mistakes, since even a small slip on their part might result in a goal for their opponents, and thus, a loss that fans are likely not to forgive. Being a successful defender calls for a consistent, reliable, and sound performance; on the other hand, being a forward is about readiness to react in an instant, having an awareness of the play of the ball without turning around—and of course, a brave heart and a firm kick to strike for your team.\n\nOne quality that any soccer player should have—whether they are a forward, a defender, a goalkeeper, or a midfielder—is the ability to sense the team and each member of it, read their intentions and act in unison for the team’s victory (Richard, Analysis of Soccer Positions). We cannot truly say which position is more valuable: whether it is the defender or the striker, since they are both irreplaceable to the team and could not work effectively without each other.###"}
