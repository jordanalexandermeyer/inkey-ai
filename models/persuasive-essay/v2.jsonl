{"prompt":"Many parents give children a weekly or monthly allowance regardless of their behavior because they believe an allowance teaches children to be financially responsible. Other parents only give children an allowance as a reward for completing chores or when they have behaved properly. Explain what you think parents should do and why.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Starting when I was about eight years old, my parents gave me a list of chores that had to be completed each week. If I did my chores, I got an allowance, a bit of change that I could use as I pleased. If I didn’t do my chores, I didn’t get my allowance. There was no other punishment, but no other punishment was necessary. That dollar or two a week was all the incentive I needed to help out around the house. Whether it was the latest Barbie or a six-pack of Hubba Bubba chewing gum, there was always something I wanted to buy. My parents could always count on me doing my chores.\n\nI think that giving children an allowance for doing chores is a smart parenting move, for it accomplishes four important goals: It helps ensure that important work gets done around the house; it teaches children that they need to do their part to make things run smoothly for the whole family; it rewards children in a realistic, practical way for good behavior; and it helps teach children how to handle money\n\nI know that some people consider money for chores a form of bribery, and others feel that children should just do their chores anyway, without the incentive of an allowance. They argue that giving kids money for doing chores undermines the lesson that they need to help the family and do their part. I can understand that point of view, and when parents give their children too much money, it does undermine those lessons. But when the allowance is small, it is simply a modern version of the age-old practice of rewarding good behavior. Once children reach a certain age, money is an appropriate and effective reward that helps them learn how to be responsible and how to manage money. They get a sense of what things are worth and how much they have to save and spend to get what they want. And learning to save in order to purchase a desired item teaches them patience and helps children better understand the value of hard work.\n\nGiving children money for doing chores is also a good introduction to the reality of the workplace. If they do the work, they get paid; if they don’t do the work, they don’t. Extra work can be rewarded with bonuses and extra praise; poor work may result in a pay cut or demotion.\n\nIt’s important for parents to find the right amount to give. Too much money may make a child feel like hired help and will undermine the goal of teaching children to help simply because they are part of a family that must work together. On the other hand, too little money may make a child feel resentful, as if his or her work isn’t worth anything to the household. What’s an appropriate amount? It depends upon the amount of chores the child is expected to do and the child’s age. If your nine-year-old is only expected to clean his or her room, a dollar a week is probably plenty. If your fourteenyear-old is expected to keep his room clean, take out the trash, water the plants, and vacuum the house, then ten dollars a week is more appropriate.\n\nBeing paid for my chores helped me have a good attitude about housework, taught me how to save money and spend it wisely, and enabled me to appreciate the hard work my parents did around the house. I’m really grateful that this was the way my parents chose to handle chores in our household.###"}
{"prompt":"More and more farmers and food manufacturers are genetically modifying their crops to reduce susceptibility to disease, improve flavor, and reduce costs. Do you think genetically modifying foods is a good idea? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A few decades ago, manipulating genes in people, plants, and animals was just science fiction. Today, it’s a reality, and genetic modification may have many positive applications in the future, including the eradication of many hereditary diseases. But like most scientific and technological advances, the genetic modification of organisms for our food supply can be as dangerous as it is beneficial. Because of the potential dangers of this technology, I think genetically altering plants and animals in the food supply is a practice that should be very tightly controlled and carefully studied before it is an accepted and common practice. Unfortunately, it may already be too late for that.\n\nMany people don’t even realize that many of their foods are genetically modified organisms (GMOs). GMOs are already prevalent in supermarkets and grocery stores across the country, but manufacturers are not required to label foods as having been made from GMOs. As a result, millions of Americans purchase and eat GMOs every day without even knowing it. Yet we don’t even know if GMOs are harmful to our health. We don’t really know how GMOs may affect our bodies or our ecosystem. When we mess with DNA, we may be making changes that have all sorts of dangerous repercussions, including some that we may not even realize for several generations.\n\nOne of the main concerns about GMOs is the unpredictability of the behavior of altered genes and of the bacteria, plants, and animals that interact with the altered organism. For example, a crop of corn genetically modified to be less susceptible to a particular insect may take on other unwanted characteristics due to the change. It may, for example, become more susceptible to another disease, or it could develop a tougher skin on its kernels, or it could decrease the crop’s ability to produce vitamin E.\n\nMore frightening is the domino effect of genetically modifying foods. Any change in an organism’s DNA has the potential to affect not only the organism but also anything that feeds off of it, including us. How do we know how GMOs might affect us on a microscopic, genetic level? We don’t know, and can’t know, without years of studies that track all sorts of potential outcomes over several generations.\n\nAnother fear is that transferred genes may escape from one organism into another. For example, imagine that Strain A of sweet peas was altered by adding a gene that would increase its sugar production. Through cross-pollination, this altered genetic code could enter other strains and slowly (or quickly) infect the entire sub-species. If the alteration was beneficial, this could be a good thing. But the altered gene might not act the same way in all varieties, and the change may not be a good thing in the first place, and\/or it may have unintended consequences.\n\nGenetically modifying foods is a practice that has been driven by the desire to make more food available more quickly and more cheaply than ever before. This attitude puts profit first and consumers and the environment last, and that is simply dangerous. The agribusiness needs to slow down and stop selling us GMOs until their safety is certain.###"}
{"prompt":"A few decades ago, many families had half a dozen or more children. Nowadays, more and more families are choosing to have only one or two children. Are smaller families better than larger ones? Why or why not? State your position and support it with specific reasons and examples.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I grew up in a large family—I am the oldest of six—and I have many wonderful memories from my childhood. I am very close to most of my siblings and I treasure my relationships with them. But when I have my own family someday, it won’t be as big as the one I grew up in. As much as my large family was full of love, and as much as I learned about sharing, giving, and patience, I think having too many kids puts too much pressure on the parents and the oldest children.\n\nWhen I think back on my childhood, I remember playing with my siblings or grandparents. I don’t remember spending a whole lot of time with my mother and father. They were always around, but they were always busy. Although they did their best to spend some quality time with each of us, there was just too much to do to keep our large family going. My mother was always cooking, cleaning, nursing, changing a diaper, shopping, or taking someone to baseball practice or a playdate. She was always tired.\n\nMy father, on the other hand, was always working. He needed overtime whenever he could get it, and weekends were always full of projects around the house. He had lots of helpers, of course, but there are only so many things kids can do. Even when we were able to get away for vacation, Mom and Dad couldn’t really relax, because there were so many kids to look after.\n\nMoney was also a constant worry for my family. With so many children, our budget was always tight. Back-to-school shopping was always a stressful time; we all wanted the latest fashions, but we could only get a few things. My younger siblings lived on hand-me-downs as much as they could. We shopped at bargain stores and often got clothes that we didn’t really like because they were on sale. Our house always needed repairs, and there was never enough money to keep up.\n\nAnother problem with large families is that the older siblings always end up being babysitters. Like it or not (and most of the time I didn’t like it), I had to watch my younger brothers and sisters. At age six, I could change a diaper like a pro. I was getting my brothers and sisters dressed, giving them breakfast, helping them get ready for bed. I learned a lot about sharing, selfsacrifice, and responsibility at an early age, and these are important character traits that I value highly and want to instill in my children. But I also want to give them a chance to be children. I don’t want them to have so much responsibility at such an early age.\n\nI don’t want to give the impression that I didn’t have a happy childhood. I most definitely did; I was loved as much as my parents could love me, and I had wonderful fun with my brothers and sisters. But I always wanted a little more time with Mom and Dad, and I often resented having so much responsibility. I wished my mom wasn’t always so tired and my dad didn’t have to work so much. Because I want to be there more for my kids, because I want them to be kids throughout their childhood, I plan to have a much smaller family.###"}
{"prompt":"Good habits improve our physical, emotional, and\/or financial health. Select one of your good habits and write an essay persuading readers to make that habit a part of their lives.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When I was fifteen, I wanted to get a job so I could buy a car when I turned sixteen. My father sat me down at the kitchen table and said, “Excellent. But only on one condition: 10% of every paycheck must go into a savings account. And you cannot touch that money except in an emergency.”\n\n“But Dad,” I argued, “If I have to put 10% away, how will I ever save enough money to buy a car?”\n\n“You’ll have enough,” he replied. “And you’ll soon see how important it is to set money aside for savings.”\n\nI didn’t believe him at the time, and in fact I often resented having to put that 10% in a separate account. But two years later when the transmission on my car blew, I didn’t have to fret about coming up with the money for repairs. I was able to cover the cost easily and was back on the road in no time. It was then that I began to see the wisdom of my father’s rule, which I adopted as my own. This habit has helped to give me a secure financial life, and I urge you to make this practice part of your life.\n\nTen percent of each paycheck may sound like a lot, and if you’re on a tight budget to begin with, you might be thinking, “I just can’t afford to do it.” In truth, you can’t afford not to do it. You never know when you are going to need an extra $100 or $1,000; life is full of surprises, and lots of them are expensive. You can afford to do this.\n\nIn fact, you can’t afford not to do this. As tight as your budget may be, it’s important to get started right away. If you are absolutely scraping by with every last penny going to bills, then start with just 5%, but move up to 10% as soon as you can. If you earn $500 a week, for example, put $25–$50 in your savings account each week. At first, this may mean clipping coupons, renting a movie instead of going to the theater, or pressing your own shirts instead of taking them to the cleaner. Think carefully about ways you can save just a few dollars—because just a few dollars from each paycheck is all it takes to build up a solid savings account.\n\nThe money you save will add up quickly. For example, if your annual salary is $40,000, each year, you would put $4,000 into your savings account. That still leaves you with $36,000 to cover all of your expenses. After ten years, you will have saved $40,000, plus interest. And the more money in your account, the more interest you earn, the larger your emergency fund, the more you can afford to relax later in your life.\n\nOnce you get in the habit of putting 10% of your money into savings, it won’t feel like a sacrifice. The 90% that’s left will be your working budget, and you won’t even miss that 10% because you won’t be used to spending it. Yet you will know that it is there, ready for an emergency, helping to keep you financially secure. So take my father’s advice, and mine: Put a piece of each paycheck into your savings. It’s a habit that’s worth every penny.###"}
{"prompt":"Is there a book that you feel should be required reading for everyone? Write an essay persuading your audience to read this book.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Most people know who Frankenstein is—or at least they think they do. Because of the way Mary Shelley’s brilliant 1818 novel has been adapted to film, most Americans think that Frankenstein is a towering, scar-faced monster who brings terror wherever he goes. In Shelley’s novel, however, the real monster is Victor Frankenstein, the scientist who is the monster’s creator. In her story of how Victor Frankenstein creates the monster and what he does after the monster comes to life, Shelley conveys several timeless messages about the dangers of science, the dangers of isolation, and the importance of being a good parent. It is a novel that everyone should read.\n\nIn the story, Frankenstein, eager for glory, wants to discover the “elixir of life” so that he can have the power to bring the dead back to life. He wants to create a new race of superhuman beings and wants them to worship him like a god. He wants to unlock the secrets of nature and use that power for his own selfish goals. Shelley’s novel warns us that we must be careful what we do with science—how we apply the knowledge we discover. For when Frankenstein does discover the “elixir of life,” and when he does create a superhuman being, he creates a creature that is beyond his control. The creature is more powerful and more intelligent than Victor Frankenstein, and the creature engineers Frankenstein’s demise.\n\nShelley’s novel also warns us about the dangers of isolation. Frankenstein’s creation is so revolting and dangerous in part because Frankenstein works completely alone. He becomes so absorbed with his project that he completely blocks out family and friends. He stops communicating with others and works secretly; he does not consult others about his project, partly because he knows that what he is doing is wrong, partly because he wants all the glory. But because he does not work with others, because he loses touch with his community of family and friends, he also loses touch with his responsibility to other human beings. When the creature comes to life, Frankenstein runs away, abandoning his creation even though he knows the creature might harm others.\n\nThis abandonment brings us to the novel’s third timeless message: the importance of being a good parent. Frankenstein creates a living being and then abandons him because he is an “ugly wretch.” He totally ignores his responsibility to the creature, who is born as innocent as a child, even though he is the size of a giant. The creature is abhorred by everyone he meets, and because no one has ever shown him love, he learns to hate. And the person he comes to hate most is the father who abandoned him. Shelley’s message is clear: you are responsible for what you create, and if you are a parent, you must love your child, whatever his or her appearance.\n\nIn our age of cloning and genetic engineering, of scattered communities and neighbors who don’t know each other’s names, of abandoned children and abusive parents, Shelley’s book may have more importance than ever. It is also a powerful and suspense-filled tale. Will Frankenstein capture the creature? Will he create a “bride” for the monster? Will Walton, the ship captain who records Frankenstein’s story, learn from Frankenstein’s tale? Find out for yourself. Grab a copy of this amazing novel and enjoy.###"}

Do you panic when you can’t find the remote control and think that you might actually have to get up off of the sofa to change the channel?\n\nIf you answered “yes” to any of these questions, you are not alone. In fact, you are one of the millions of Americans who are “couch potatoes”: people who spend their days and nights “vegging out” in front of the “tube.” Well, spud, it’s time to get up out of that armchair and get some exercise!\n\nI know how seductive television can be. I know how easy it is to plop onto the sofa and lose yourself in the world of sports, reality shows, and goodold make-believe. I know how mesmerizing MTV and other channels can be and how hard it can be to pull yourself away. But all that television spells disaster for your body because it needs to be active to be healthy. And it’s no good for your mental health or social life, either.\n\nThink about what all that time in front of the television is doing to your body.

{"prompt":"Nowadays, the private life of a politician is hardly private. In your opinion, should we be so concerned with the private affairs of a politician or political candidate? State your position and support it with specific reasons and examples.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When you think of former president Bill Clinton, what’s the first thing that comes to mind? Unfortunately, for many people, the first thing they think of is Monica Lewinsky. Like millions of people around the globe, I was horrified by how much the investigation delved into Mr. Clinton’s private affairs. No one needed to know the sort of details that were revealed by Ken Starr’s investigation. But while I don’t want to know the details, I do believe we have a right to know what sort of lives our politicians are living. I believe their behavior in private is a reflection of their true values and how they will behave in office.\n\nFor example, if a politician lies to his or her spouse (I’m talking about big lies, like infidelity, not little white lies), that tells us something about his or her character. In my opinion, this person is not to be trusted. I wouldn’t have faith that this politician would keep his or her word. True, the relationship between a husband and wife is very different from that between a politician and his or her constituents. But the politician’s respect for that relationship and how he or she deals with any problems in that relationship reflects his or her level of integrity.\n\nSimilarly, if a politician (or political candidate) behaves in an illegal manner, that shows a disrespect for the law. A government official who employs an illegal resident as a nanny or housekeeper, for example, or pays a nanny or housekeeper under the table to avoid taxes is acting as if he or she is above the law—or demonstrating that he or she simply doesn’t care about the law. This is not the kind of person I want in a public office.\n\nOn the other hand, if a politician leads a respectable, law-abiding life at home, we can expect a respectable, law-abiding performance in office. A politician who deals honestly with family, friends, and business associates is likely to deal honestly with his or her constituents as well. A politician who respects the law in all aspects of his or her private life is likely to respect the law while in office, too. A candidate who behaves in a cautious, reserved manner regarding his or her personal affairs is likely to bring a similar approach to the office.\n\nI know that nobody is perfect and that every politician may have skeletons in the closet. I’m not talking about transgressions from the distant past. But I am concerned with a politician’s recent past and current behavior. Is he or she honest or does he or she break promises? Does he or she behave recklessly or in a thoughtful and controlled manner? We cannot separate who we are personally from who we are professionally. That is why I believe the public has a right to know.###"}
{"prompt":"Today’s top professional athletes often have salaries and bonuses in the tens of millions of dollars. Do you think these athletes deserve such high compensation? Why or why not? Explain your position and use specific reasons and examples.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When he was at the height of his basketball career, Michael Jordan was making approximately $300,000 per game. That’s more than most people make in a year; indeed, it’s more than some people earn in a lifetime. Yes, Michael Jordan was a phenomenal basketball player. Yes, he was also a fantastic role model. But no, he did not deserve to earn such a ridiculously high salary. Jordan, like many other top professional athletes, was grossly overpaid.\n\nWhy do top athletes earn such inflated salaries? Because they bring big bucks into their cities and franchises. But what sort of service do they provide to society? Do they save lives? No. Do they improve the standard of living or promote positive social change? No. Do they help keep our streets safe or educate our kids? No. True, many of the top athletes are good role models for our children. But seven-figure salaries don’t always mean model behavior. Take N.B.A. star Latrell Spreewell, for example, who choked and threatened to kill his coach.\n\nIt is true that professional athletes work hard, and many have spent their lives pursuing their goals. It is also true that most professional athletes have a relatively short career span—a decade perhaps at the top of their game. Limited as their professional sporting career may be, they don’t deserve such high salaries. After their professional sports careers are over, they can certainly pursue other careers and work “regular” jobs like the rest of us. Ending their stint as professional athletes doesn’t mean they have to stop earning incomes. They just have to earn incomes in a different way. Why should they be any different from the rest of us who may need to switch careers?\n\nIt is also true that professional athletes may be injured while on the job; their work is indeed physical, and especially in contact sports like football, injuries are bound to happen. But, like the rest of us, they have insurance, and in nearly all cases, their exorbitant salaries more than cover their medical costs. And theirs is not the only high-risk job. What about miners, construction workers, or firefighters? They are at risk for physical injury every day, too—injuries that could likewise end their careers. But they sure aren’t earning millions of dollars a year.\n\nIt is also true that professional athletes may spend years and years practicing with farm teams for a fraction of the salary they receive once they make it to the top. But in every career path, we start off with lower wages and must pay our dues and work our way up. Besides, farm team salaries are not always so low.\n\nWe’re a sports-crazy country, a nation of fanatic sports fans and celebrity worshippers. We’re awed and entertained by the best of them—the Michael Jordans, the Alex Rodriguezes, the Emmitt Smiths. But as much as they may inspire and amuse us, professional athletes do not deserve such high salaries. Those millions could be much more wisely spent.###"}
{"prompt":"Is reading fiction a waste of time? Why or why not? Explain your answer using specific reasons and examples to support your position.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Remember the last book that captured your imagination, that transported you to another place and time? Remember a book that made you fall in love with its characters, made you feel their pain and joy? Remember a story that taught you an important lesson, that helped you better understand others, make sense of the human condition? If so, then you can understand why the question, “Is reading fiction a waste of time?” is such a silly question.\n\nFiction, unlike a user manual, a magazine article, or newspaper editorial, probably won’t offer you any practical knowledge that you can put to immediate use. It won’t inform you of current events or give you advice on how to cultivate a better garden. It probably won’t help you decide which candidate to vote for or which product to buy. But that certainly doesn’t mean it’s useless or impractical. Indeed, fiction serves three important functions for human beings: It helps us be more compassionate to others, it helps us better understand ourselves, and it cultivates our imaginations. It can also teach us about history, psychology, even biology and other sciences.\n\nCompassion for others is rooted in understanding and acceptance, and a good story brings us into the inner world of its characters so that we can understand them. In Toni Morrison’s novel The Bluest Eye, for example, Morrison peels away the layers of her characters’ histories piece by piece like an onion until we see into their core and understand what drives them. They may still do awful things to each other, but she shows us why they do the things that they do, and we learn that we shouldn’t judge others until we understand their pasts. Their stories are sad and painful, and we learn to love even the outcast Pecola. In fact, we learn that those outcasts are the ones who need our love the most.\n\nMany stories and novels also help us better understand ourselves. Joseph Conrad’s dark and powerful novel Heart of Darkness helps us see that all of us have a dark side, and that we need to acknowledge this dark side in order to control it. It makes us question just how civilized we are and indeed what it means to be civilized in the first place.\n\nGood fiction also cultivates our imagination, which is more important to us than some might think. Without imagination, we live a sad, empty life. Imagination is central to our emotional health and is a key factor in our level of intelligence. Facts are one thing; but facts can be of no real use unless coupled with imagination. Fiction can help us by keeping our imagination fresh and active. In a story like Franz Kafka’s “Metamorphosis,” for example, we are asked to imagine that Gregor, the main character, wakes up one morning and has turned into a giant bug. Crazy? Perhaps. But once we accept this premise and imagine Gregor as a five-foot long cockroach, we can feel his family’s horror and imagine his agony as he finds himself trapped in his room and abandoned by those he loves.\n\nIs reading fiction a waste of time? That’s like asking if laughing is a waste of time. We don’t need fiction to survive, but we do need it to be kinder, more understanding, and more creative human beings.###"}
{"prompt":"Some people think that school cafeterias should be required to provide low-fat and\/or vegetarian lunch options to accommodate the eating habits of all students. Do you agree or disagree? Explain your position and use specific reasons and examples as support.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It’s a fact: There are students across the United States who are vegetarian and\/or health conscious, and school cafeterias should be required to provide low-fat and\/or vegetarian lunch options for them. Even more importantly, many teenagers’ dietary decisions are not only based on health concerns but also religious and\/or moral issues. In this day and age, an individual's eating habits often reflect his or her identity. For these reasons, it's imperative that each school's cafeteria menu be as diverse as its student body.\n\nJust by reading headlines in any of the major news magazines, it becomes clear that the United States is a nation that needs to slim down. In every town and city, there are an abundance of fast food restaurants that lure teenage customers with fast, inexpensive, and tasty food, but these foods are typically unhealthy. Unfortunately, school cafeterias, in an effort to provide food that is appetizing to young people, mimic fast food menus, often serving items such as burgers and fries, pizza, hot dogs, and fried chicken. While these foods do provide some nutritional value, they are relatively high in fat, and many of them, namely burgers, hot dogs, and fried chicken, are clearly not designed for vegetarians.\n\nMany of the lunch selections currently offered by most school cafeterias could be made vegetarian and\/or more healthy with a few simple and inexpensive substitutions. Veggie burgers, for example, offered alongside beef burgers, would give both vegetarians and the health conscious more options. A salad bar woud also serve the dual purpose of providing both vegetarians and low-fat food eaters the opportunity for a satisfying meal. This is not to say that accommodating every desire or food preference is plausible, but students should have the right to be served foods that coincide with their life choices.###"}
{"prompt":"Many people feel that the use of surveillance cameras in public places such as parking lots is a good idea that can help ensure our safety. Others worry that too many cameras violate our right to privacy and give law enforcement officials too much power. In your opinion, should we install more surveillance cameras in public places? Why or why not? Support your position with specific reasons and examples.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Not long ago, the nation was gripped by the horrifying news that a baby had been stolen from a car in a parking lot while her mother, who was returning a shopping cart, was just a few feet away. Thanks to the description of the kidnapper captured by surveillance cameras in the parking lot and broadcast over radios, television, and highway overpass signs, the kidnapper was quickly caught and the baby returned, unharmed, to her mother. Had it not been for those surveillance cameras, that mother would probably never have seen her baby girl again.\n\nI can’t think of a much better argument for the use of surveillance cameras in public places. That baby’s life was saved by those parking lot cameras. Many people worry about the use of surveillance cameras in public places such as parking lots, stores, parks, and roadways. They don’t like the idea that they are being watched. They worry that the information captured on the surveillance tapes can somehow be used against them. But how? It seems to me that the only reason we should worry about being caught on surveillance cameras is if we are doing something wrong. If we are behaving lawfully in a public place, then why worry if it is captured on film?\n\nSurveillance cameras can provide two immensely important services. One, they can help us find those who commit crimes, including thieves, kidnappers, vandalizers, and even murderers. Two, they can serve as a powerful deterrent to crime. A thief who plans to steal a car may think twice if he knows he will be caught on video. A woman who hopes to kidnap a child may abandon her plans if she knows she will be captured on film.\n\nSurveillance cameras can also help us in less critical but nonetheless practical ways. In some towns in England, for example, radio deejays use information from surveillance cameras to announce the availability of parking spaces in crowded public parking lots. Problems of all shapes and sizes can also be noted and addressed through video surveillance. For example, imagine a video camera installed in a local town square. Reviewing the films, officials might realize that people who meet in the square move quickly into the shade of the one tree in the center of the square. This could move officials to plant more trees or provide tables with umbrellas so that people could meet and relax in the shade. Similarly, a video camera in a grocery store might reveal that Isle 7 is always overcrowded, prompting the manager to re-arrange items to more evenly distribute shoppers.\n\nOf course it’s possible to have too much of a good thing, and if surveillance cameras cross the line and start being installed on private property— that is, in our offices and homes—then we will have the “Big Brother is watching” scenario opponents fear. If that were the case, I would be against surveillance cameras, too. But as long as surveillance cameras are limited to public places, they can help ensure our safety.###"}
{"prompt":"Alexander Smith said, “The great man is the man who does a thing for the first time.” Do you agree with this definition of greatness? Why or why not?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Just as there are many definitions of success, there are also many definitions of greatness. Alexander Smith said that a great person is someone who does a thing for the first time. He’s right, and the list of those great people is long and includes the likes of Neil Armstrong, Jackie Robinson, and Thomas Edison. But Smith’s definition isn’t broad enough to include many other people who I believe are also great. In my opinion, greatness can also be attained by doing something to improve the lives of others.\n\nMother Teresa is the first person to come to mind under this broadened definition. Mother Teresa, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, dedicated her life to helping the poor, the sick, and the hungry. She left her homeland of Yugoslavia to work with the impoverished people of India, where she selflessly served others for almost 70 years. She became a nun and founded the Missionaries of Charity sisterhood and the House for the Dying. She embraced those that many in society chose to disdain and ignore: the crippled and diseased, the homeless and helpless. She gave them food, shelter, medical care, and the compassion that so many others denied them. She was certainly not the first to dedicate her life to the care of others, but she was certainly a great woman.\n\nAnother great person who also won a Nobel Peace Prize was Dr. Albert Schweitzer, a German doctor who, like Mother Teresa, also selflessly served the poor and sick. Schweitzer dedicated himself to the people of Africa. There, he built a hospital and a leper colony, a refuge for those who had been rejected by society. Again, he was not the first to offer care and comfort for the sick and suffering. But he certainly was great.\n\nHarriet Tubman is also clearly a great woman. She led hundreds of American slaves to freedom along the underground railroad, risking her life over and over again to bring her fellow slaves to freedom. She gave them the greatest gift one can offer: freedom to live a better way of life. She wasn’t the first to escape, and she wasn’t the first to go back for others. But she was the one who kept going back. She knew that each time she returned for another, she was risking her life. But like Mother Teresa and Dr. Schweitzer, Harriet Tubman was utterly dedicated to improving the life of others.\n\nGreatness comes in many forms, and we are lucky to have many examples of greatness upon which to model our lives. Some great people are those who were able to be the first to accomplish something marvelous. Others, like Mother Teresa, Albert Schweitzer, and Harriet Tubman, are great because they worked tirelessly to ease the suffering of their fellow human beings.###"}
{"prompt":"Should people lease or buy new cars? Make a case for the option that you think is best. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Planning to lease a car because you don’t think you can afford to buy? Think again. Leasing can end up being just as expensive as buying—and you don’t even get to keep the car. Even if you decide to buy the car at the end of your lease, you may end up paying considerably more money than if you’d decided to buy from the beginning.\n\nMost people who are thinking about leasing are attracted to this option because they believe it will cost them less money. And they’re right—it is cheaper, but only in the short term. For example, if you were to lease a 2002 Subaru Forester, with $2,500 down, you might pay $250 per month for the car. If you were to buy the same car, with $2,500 down, you would pay closer to $350 per month. Over a three-year lease, that’s $3,600—a big savings. But after your lease is over, you have to give the car back. If you want to keep driving, you’ll either have to put another down-payment on another lease, or, if you have the option to buy the car, you’ll have to pay thousands of dollars to purchase the vehicle—dollars that won’t be spread out in more manageable monthly payments.\n\nMany people want to lease because they can then drive a nicer car than they might otherwise be able to afford. For example, if your monthly budget allowed you to spend $250 on your car, you might be able to lease a brand new Ford Explorer. For the same price, you might have to buy an Explorer that was two or three years old with 50,000 miles, or buy a new but considerably less expensive make and model. A lease therefore allows you to drive in the latest models of more expensive cars. But when your lease is over, you will have to return that Explorer. Whatever car you can afford to buy, you get to keep it, and it will always have a resell or trade-in value if you wanted to later upgrade to a newer car.\n\nFurthermore, people who lease cars are often shocked by how much they must pay when the lease is over. Most leases limit you to a certain number of miles, and if you go over that allotment, you must pay for each mile. As a result, at the end of your lease, you may end up paying thousands of dollars in mileage fees. For example, if your lease covers you for 25,000 miles over three years, but you drive 40,000, that’s an extra 15,000 miles. At $.11 per mile, that’s $1,650 you’ll have to pay. And you still won’t have a car.\n\nIn addition, when you lease, you still have to pay for regular maintenance and repairs to the vehicle. Since you must return the car when your lease expires, you are paying to repair someone else’s car. If you own the car, however, you would know that every dollar you spend maintaining or repairing the car is an investment in a real piece of property—your property, not someone else’s.\n\nBy now, the benefits of buying over leasing should be clear. But if you’re still not convinced, remember this fundamental fact: If you lease, when your lease is up, after you’ve made all of your monthly payments, paid for extra mileage, and paid for repairs, you must give the car back. It isn’t yours to keep, no matter how much the lease cost you. Whatever make or model you can afford to buy, it is yours to keep after you make your payments. There’s no giving it back, and that makes all the difference.###"}
{"prompt":"The inventor and statesman Benjamin Franklin said, “Money never made a man happy yet, nor will it. There is nothing in its nature to produce happiness.” Do you agree with this statement? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Benjamin Franklin is one of the greatest figures in American history, and I have a great deal of respect for this incredible inventor, politician, and writer. But I must respectfully disagree with his claim that, “Money never made a man happy yet, nor will it. There is nothing in its nature to produce happiness.” I agree that money in and of itself does not make a person happy; but I believe that money can help provide one thing that is essential to happiness: good health.\n\nWhile money can do nothing to change our genetic makeup and our physiological predisposition to illness and disease, it can give us access to better healthcare throughout our lives. This begins with prenatal care and childhood vaccinations. In impoverished third-world countries, infant mortality rates are three, four, even ten times higher than in the United States, and as many as one in four women still die in childbirth because they do not have access to modern medical care. Sadly, people who are too poor to afford vaccinations and routine healthcare for their children watch helplessly as many of those children succumb to illnesses and diseases that are rarely fatal here in the United States.\n\nMoney also enables us to afford better doctors and see specialists throughout our lives. If your child has difficulty hearing, for example, and you have insurance (which costs money) or cash, you can see a hearing specialist and pay for therapy. If you have migraines that make you miserable, you can see a headache specialist and afford medication and treatment. Having money also means being able to afford preventative measures, such as taking vitamins and getting regular check-ups. It means being able to afford products and services that can enhance our health, such as gym memberships, organic foods, and acupuncture.\n\nAnother important thing money can do is enable us to live in a healthy environment. Many of the world’s poorest people live in dirty, dangerous places—unsanitary slums crawling with diseases and health hazards of all sorts. In a particularly poor area of the Bronx, for example, children had an abnormally high rate of asthma because their families couldn’t afford to move away from the medical waste treatment plant that was poisoning the air.\n\nMoney can also help us be healthy by enabling us to afford proper heating and cooling measures. This includes being able to afford a warm winter coat and the opportunity to cool off at a pool or in the ocean. On a more basic level, it means being able to afford heat in the winter and air conditioning in the summer. During heat waves, victims of heat stroke are often those who are too poor to afford air conditioning in their apartments. In extreme cold, the same is true: people who freeze to death or become gravely ill from the cold are often those who are unable to afford high heating bills.\n\nHaving money may not make people happy, but it sure goes a long way toward keeping them healthy. And as they say, if you haven’t got your health, you haven’t got anything.###"}
{"prompt":"Some states have now made it illegal to drive while talking on a hand-held cellular phone. Do you think this is a good law that should be passed in other states as well? Why or why not? Explain your answer.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" No matter how careful a driver you may be, when you do something else while driving, whether it’s drinking coffee, changing the radio station, looking at a map, or making a call on your cell phone, you endanger yourself and others because you are distracted from your driving. Even a fraction of a second of distraction is enough to cause an accident. While no state can make it illegal to drink coffee or switch stations while driving, all states can, and should, make it illegal to drive while talking on a cellular phone.\n\nIn the past decade, as the popularity of cellular phones has risen, so have the number of accidents caused by people talking on their cell phones. Whether they were dialing a number, listening to a message, or simply in a heated conversation, they were momentarily distracted from the task of driving, and suddenly—crash! Fortunately, many of these accidents have been minor fender-benders. But all too many have been deadly accidents that could have been prevented by a stricter cell-phone use laws.\n\nCell phone proponents may argue that talking on a cell phone is no more dangerous than, for example, having a cup of coffee while on the road or talking to someone in the back seat. But unlike a cup of coffee, which you can put down between sips, you must keep the phone in your hand. That means that you have only one hand on the wheel while you’re driving. That makes cell phones doubly dangerous: not only are you distracted by dialing or by the conversation; you are also driving one-handed, which means you are less in control. If you suddenly need both hands on the wheel to prevent an accident or to keep your car from sliding, the extra second it takes to get your hand back on the wheel can make the difference between an accident and an accident narrowly averted, between a serious injury and a minor one.\n\nCell phones are also dangerous because when you are busy talking, especially if you really have to concentrate on the matter you are discussing, your mind is not fully focused on the road, and this has a significant effect on your reaction time. You will be slower to make important driving decisions such as how soon to brake and when to switch lanes, and you will be less able to respond to situations on the road.\n\nMany people use cell phones to report accidents and emergencies, to let loved ones know they’ll be late, and to stay in touch when they’re out of town. I’m not arguing that you shouldn’t have a cell phone in your car. What I am saying is that you shouldn’t be driving when you’re talking on that phone. Until your state outlaws hand-held cell phones in cars, pull over to the side of the road when you are ready to make a call. It may add a few extra minutes to your commute, but it just might save your life.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the disadvantages of school uniforms?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" School uniforms and why students wear them has been a topic of concern and debate for as long as these clothes have been around. Though people who argue that wearing uniforms in educational institutions make people appear all equal, give a sense of community, and teach discipline, I believe there are more disadvantages to wearing uniforms than advantages. Namely, demanding students to adorn uniforms takes away freedom, they are often uncomfortable, they are a waste of money, they promote conformity over individuality, and children’s self-image is damaged more when they wear uniforms at school.\n\nMost developed countries, like the United States of America, believe in one’s right to freedom of expression. Making it mandatory for students to give up their right to express themselves through clothing is wrong. According to ProCon.org, “The First Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees that all individuals have the right to express themselves freely. The US Supreme Court stated in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (7-2, 1969) that “it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.” In the 1970 case Richards v. Thurston (3-0), which revolved around a boy refusing to have his hair cut shorter, the US First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that “compelled conformity to conventional standards of appearance” does not “seem a justifiable part of the educational process”’ (“School Uniforms – ProCon.org”). So, not only is the demand to wear uniforms in a sense unconstitutional, it also goes against rulings by the Supreme Court. In this way, it can be said that making uniforms in schools mandatory is un-American.\n\nOn the side of practicality, uniforms are often seen as less comfortable than normal clothes. They can be tight and not adjustable to different weather conditions. The temperatures in winter and summer can be unbearable in a standard school uniform. Many students have expressed through surveys that they do not feel comfortable in their uniforms, and they this type of clothing does not adjust well to varying weather conditions (“Research on School Uniforms – It’s Clear, They Disadvantage Girls”).\n\nAnother practical concern is that paying for uniforms wastes the money of parents, when their children can simply wear the clothes they have. Also, schools could be selling uniforms for more than necessary. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the Guardian reports that, “Parents could be spending millions of pounds more than they need to on school uniforms because of exclusive deals between schools and suppliers, the government’s competition watchdog has warned. Headteachers and school governing bodies were told by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Thursday that they must let parents “shop around” for affordable uniforms for their children, using supermarkets if they wish rather than be forced to buy more expensive items in exclusive arrangements with suppliers” (Smithers, Rebecca). This means that not only do parents have to spend extra money on an outfit, but also the uniforms schools are selling are overpriced.\n\nLeaning more into the abstract, uniforms promote conformity instead of individuality. A sense of individuality is key in democratic societies, and it should be nurtured when young. According to ProCon.org, “At a time when schools are encouraging an appreciation of diversity, enforcing standardized dress sends a contradictory message. In schools where uniforms are specifically gendered (girls must wear skirts and boys must wear pants), transgendered, gender-fluid, and gender-nonconforming students can feel ostracized” (“School Uniforms – ProCon.org”). So, in order for each person to not feel the pressure of societal conformity, it is important that schools keep a sense of diversity.\n\nLastly, many students feel they do not look their best in uniforms. This is due to the fact that uniforms fit the mold of certain body types, and curvier or plus-size individuals often feel out of place and uncomfortable in uniforms. Wearing uniforms lends itself to more comparison, and children who do not fit the mold of a “normal” student in terms of body type are commonly ridiculed by classmates (Flam, Lisa).\n\nThough there are some benefits to wearing uniforms in school, I believe there are more disadvantages than advantages to using them. This is because they strip away freedom, they are uncomfortable, it is a waste of money to buy them, they celebrate conformity over individuality, and the self-image of children is damaged more when they wear uniforms. Let us keep our schools constitutional by allowing students to wear what they deem expresses their unique personality, within the limits of appropriateness.###"}
{"prompt":"What were some of the most controversial actions of President Obama during his time in office?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" President Barack Obama left office with better than average polls. He is a charismatic leader that countless people adore. However, Obama has many critics as well: there are definite reasons for lambasting him. Many race-related riots and attacks happened during his presidency, his withdrawal from troops in Iraq and Afghanistan lead to a further disaster in the area, his promotion of the drone program was ethically unsound, and the economic progress he made during his eight years was historically low.\n\nThough Obama was the first African-American U.S. president, and he was seen as a bridge between racial communities, the amount of race riots and race-related violence grew during his two terms. According to the Washington Examiner, “The legacy of Obama represented a time when race-related riots were on the rise. We can’t forget the scenes on television in Baltimore and Ferguson, or the violence that erupted after the deaths of Oscar Grant, Trayvon Martin, Manuel Diaz, and Kimini Gray. Images taken from each of these events resembled combat zones, with police in riot gear while angry citizens burned cars, smashed windows, and vandalized storefronts” (Vargas, Mark, and Evan Vucci). Some of the worst race-related ordeals happened during his presidency, though he ran on a campaign of hope and unity.\n\nIn addition, as one of Obama’s campaign promises, he wanted to settle the Iraq War and bring home American troops. However, many say that this plan was disastrous in terms of its long-term effects. According to the Washington Times, “A number of former and current military leaders who were in power when all U.S. troops left Iraq are saying today that the complete exit left the door open for the Islamic State’s land grab. The assessment comes from the Army chief of staff, a former Marine commandant, a former U.S. Central Command chief, a former defense secretary and, privately, from the officer now running the war in Iraq against the Islamic State, also known as ISIL and ISIS” (Scarborough, Rowan). Republicans and Democrats can fight all they want over Obama creating more mayhem in the region, but military experts claim a clear case of a blunder.\n\nAnother highly contentious act of Obama was his use of the drone program to implement attacks against terrorists. According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, “Obama embraced the US drone programme, overseeing more strikes in his first year than Bush carried out during his entire presidency. A total of 563 strikes, largely by drones, targeted Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen during Obama’s two terms, compared to 57 strikes under Bush. Between 384 and 807 civilians were killed in those countries, according to reports logged by the Bureau” (Purkiss, Jessica, and Jack Serle). The mass killings of children and noncombatants is an unforgivable error of Obama.\n\nThough Obama inherited an economic crisis from Bush, he failed to make significant gains. As stated by USA Today, “Of course, Obama was starting from the nadir of the Great Recession, so economic and job growth should have been expected. And many economists suggest that the increased taxes, onerous regulations enacted in bills such as Dodd-Frank and the Affordable Care Act, as well as the perception that Obama was anti-business, slowed the economic recovery. In terms of economic output, this was the slowest economic recovery since World War II” (Tanner, Michael D.). It is difficult to break through a recession, but it seems Obama did not have the skills or was not positioned correctly to make the gains that were needed.\n\nObama is admired worldwide for his personality and demeanor—however, despite his effective policy making, Obama committed many blunders during his presidency. Race relations went out of control under his watch, his pullout of troops in Iraq spurred greater conflict, his drone program killed hundreds of innocent civilians, and he made the worst economic recovery since World War II. These factors, and more, have shown that Obama was not one of the greatest presidents of the U.S.—but a rather mediocre one.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of being moral?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are many criminals that roam the earth for the benefit of themselves. There are also many hedonists that believe that everything done for the greatest pleasure is ultimately the purpose of life. However, I want to make the case today for morality over immortality. For this essay, I will consider morality according to Oxford Dictionaries: “Principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behaviour.” Though morality is a rather subjective subject, there are some principles that are universal across all cultures found by an Oxford University study: “help your family, help your group, return favours, be brave, defer to superiors, divide resources fairly, and respect others’ property” (“Seven Moral Rules Found All around the World”). The fact that these morals are found across 60 cultures from around the world demonstrates that morality, though subjective, is the cornerstone of keeping our societies together. Here are some reasons to be moral: without morality, a social life is almost impossible to maintain; having a good reputation and having a clear conscience is psychologically healthy; and most philosophies regard altruistic and principled behavior as important.\n\nThere is no doubt that without morals, a society cannot function effectively. Chaos would rein. According to the Society of Morality, “We are social animals, and the actions we take — the things we do and the things we don’t do — have consequences on our environments and on the others around us. As a result, we need to be able to govern our behavior in the near term so as not to injure ourselves or our community in the long term. This system of controlling our actions and our thoughts in order to operate in a community is what we often refer to as morality” (Society of Morality). Therefore, we need a set of morals in order to operate within a social circle and a social environment. Acting immoral usually results in being excluded from social activities or being shunned by a society based on laws and cultural norms.\n\nBesides acting moral having a sociological need, it also has a psychological basis. Most people are concerned to some extent about their reputation. According to PsyPost, “A lot of economic models of human behavior assume that people are only rational when they narrowly pursue their own self-interest, but history shows us that people are also tremendously concerned with being and appearing moral” (Dolan, Eric W). So, the fear of one’s reputation being tarnished is often a strong motivator to be moral. And if someone has been immoral, most people go out of their way to make sure no one finds out, or to correct the behavior in order to not be caught. This goes in line with conscience as well. People generally feel in a better psychological state if they feel that their conscience is clean. A dirty conscience can result in a lack of sleep, anxiety, internal stress, and even illness.\n\nOn the side of philosophy, the study of ethics comes into play. Most philosophers agree that one should rationally choose a set of standards of behavior in order to function. Though there is moral relativism, there are universal anthropological morals, as mentioned in the introduction. By the nature of our societies and cultures, we choose what we believe is right and wrong. But surprising, this rational behavior comes to a general consensus on morals. So, there is a fine line between moral relativism and moral absolutism. Morality is neither completely relative, and neither absolute (“Morality”). But the main thing to take away from this discussion is that philosophers generally believe that each individual has the right to rationally come up with a set of ethics to live by, and that it is healthy to do so.\n\nBeing moral benefits us in many ways. Socially, it allows us to fit into groups better and to be in concord with others. Psychologically, acting moral keeps our reputation solid and maintains a clear conscience. Lastly, being moral is advocated by philosophy, which tells individuals to seek to carve one’s own sense of ethics to operate in this world and to understand oneself. Besides, it just feels better to be moral, overall.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages of getting an education online?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It seems everything is moving online these days. Even our education is transferring onto the internet. Many people might squabble about the disadvantages of this phenomena, but today, I want to discuss the advantages of getting an education online. This is a pertinent topic, as the future of education is moving more and more towards shifting physical educational institutions online. There are reasons for this: many times you can learn whatever you want, it is more comfortable in a variety of ways, online courses often look good on resumes, the pacing of learning is managed by the learner, and the cost of virtual education is often lower than traditional education.\n\nThe freedom to choose your educational path is an enduring quality of online education. For more creative people, or people who want to focus on a single activity, this can be a dream come true. According to elearning Industry, “You can pick the program of your dreams in traditional education, too, but that would involve traveling away from home, living in a completely unknown city, and struggling in an extremely competitive learning environment. With online education, you can take any program or course present in traditional four-year universities” (Norman, Stephanie). So, the ease of access to the courses and majors you are striving to study are widely available online. This increases opportunities to gain the education we desire instead of making needless compromises.\n\nLike the last point, comfort takes center stage for many students. Countless students choose online education in order to avoid wasting time travelling and on many other activities in order to attend physical education institutions. According to the Open Education Database, “Commercials that feature online students studying in their pajamas only skims the surface of one of the benefits of online education: no physical class sessions. Students listen to lectures and complete assignments sent to them electronically, with no need to fight traffic, leave work early for class, or miss important family time. Rather than miss important class sessions (due to weather conditions), students in online courses can always “attend” by participating in discussion boards or chat sessions, turning in their work on time, and watching lectures or reading materials” (“10 Advantages of Taking Online Classes”). In other words, by being an online student, you circumnavigate many of the issues that regular students endure on a daily basis.\n\nIn addition, many employers are happy to see online courses on resumes. Many recruiters see the taking of online courses as a sign of taking initiative. As stated by Pongo Resume, “Employers respect a degree earned online as much as a degree earned from attending a brick-and-mortar school. They understand that with the technological advances we have today, more and more employees are getting their education and training online. Because hiring managers value continuing education and professional development, having the relevant courses and programs in the education section of your resume will demonstrate that you are resourceful and have taken the initiative to stay ahead of the curve and improve professionally” (“The Advantages of Online Learning for You and Your Career”). Therefore, not only is online education seen as equal to regular education by employers, but it is also viewed as being competent in the latest technologies and trends.\n\nBack to the students, one of the great advantages of online education is that learners can study at their own pace. According to eLearning Industry, “This type of system does not require attending live sessions; you can access the materials at any time that works for you. If you have to work or take care of your home and children during the day, you can study at night. That’s an advantage the traditional educational system cannot beat” (Norman, Stephanie). In addition, people who want to take a longer time to receive a degree can do so without any pressure.\n\nFinally, the cost of getting an online education is cheaper on average than receiving a traditional education. According to the Open Education Database, “Though not all online degrees offer less expensive net tuition prices than traditional colleges, associated expenses almost always cost less. For example, there are no commuting costs, and sometimes required course materials, such as textbooks, are available online at no cost. In addition, many colleges and universities accept credits earned via free massive open online courses (MOOCs), the most recent advance in online education” (“10 Advantages of Taking Online Classes”). Thus, there are a variety of reasons why an online education costs less.\n\nReceiving an online education is becoming more and more popular due to a multitude of advantages it has over traditional instruction. These advantages include, to name a few: students can learn whatever they want, it is more comfortable, online courses often look great on resumes, the pacing of learning is managed by the pupil, and the cost is often lower than traditional education. With these reasons, it is hard to not see why this form of education is on the rise.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of girls playing sports?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Though girls have been shown to drop out of sports more regularly than boys, this does not mean that the promotion and engagement of girls in sports is wrong, In fact, there are many good reasons why girls should participate in sports through their school years, and beyond. Girls who participate in sports have better physical health, mental health, teamwork skills, social circles, communication skills, and more.\n\nPhysical health is not only improved in boys when they participate in sports, but girls as well. Boys and girls are both human after all. In fact, according to The Huffington Post, “The Women’s Sports Foundation’s report “Her Life Depends On It III“ reviewed data from over 1,500 studies that demonstrate the importance of sport and physical activity for women and young girls. According to the report, staying active and participating in physical activity can prevent chronic diseases such as obesity and heart disease, lower rates of substance abuse, reduce risky behaviors, and decrease rates of teenage pregnancies” (Moses, Edwin). Most of this is common to boys as well, but decreasing rates of teenage pregnancy is vital. Too often, girls’ careers and lives in general are drastically changed by early pregnancies.\n\nPhysical health is valuable, obviously. However, mental health is just as vital, especially for teenagers. According to the website MomsTeam, “Girls playing sports have higher self-esteem and look to relationships with boys less to build self-esteem. Female athletes obsess less about their looks and whether they are attractive. Studies have consistently shown that girls who are physically active perceive their academic and athletic ability in a better light” (Lench, Brooke de). In addition, girls who play sports have been shown to have less an inclination towards suicide and depression in general. For girls, having balanced mental health is key to having a successful academic career.\n\nBesides having fine physical and mental health, gaining teamwork skills is important. They often convert into a successful career. Stated by Forbes, “In 2002, a study by mutual fund company Oppenheimer revealed that a shocking 82% of women in executive-level jobs had played organized sports in middle, high or post-secondary school. Moreover, nearly half of women earning over $75,000 identified themselves as “athletic”’ (Goudreau, Jenna). This indicates that if you want a successful career as a woman, playing in team sports is a great foundation. Often what we do in our school years reflects our future path.\n\nHaving a great career is one thing, but having lasting friendships is another benefit of girls playing sports. With such an intense competition to be popular in school, friendships are valuable. According to Reachout.com, “With girls, participation in sport also broadens the social convoy to which young girls have access and strengthens relationships within groups. This increased sense of social connectedness is especially beneficial as it leads to social identification with a prosocial entity” (“The Role of Friends in Sports Participation”). These social activities dig many teenage girls out of depression and a lack of self-identity. Participating in sports allows girls to find their group, and to do collective activities together that are positive.\n\nThough girls commonly communicate better than boys at early age, some girls feel shy in groups. Joining a sports team can help these introverted girls become more communicative. According to Play for Change, “Playing sport gives children the opportunity to share any problems they have. As they open up, they also learn to trust other people with important personal information. Doing this at an early age will encourage children to communicate more freely with others, setting a strong foundation for healthy personal relationships when they reach adulthood” (“The Relationship of It All: Playing Team Sport Can Enhance Relationship Skills”).\n\nGirls leave sports teams more frequently than boys, but that does not mean they should not engage in sports. Girls who are a part of sports teams have increased physical health, mental well-being, teamwork skills, social activity, communication abilities, and more. Girls who engage in sports often have successful futures in terms of their careers and social lives.###"}
{"prompt":"How does the inclusion of girls and women in sports have a certain threshold that cannot be physically crossed?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Gender can be seen as purely biological, or within a cultural context. These days, gender is seen as a range of identifications concerning being female or male. However, traditionally, strictly male and female categories have been used in sports. Concerning gender in sports, it is a tricky issue. Sometimes, there is a differentiation in sports organizations based on gender for almost no reason at all, and other instances it seems obvious why there would be a separation of the sexes due to physical differences. My main contention is that sports that demand a heavy physical component should be divided by gender due to purely physical capabilities, while sports that demand only a low physical component can be played by all genders. I believe this due to the fact that if women were in such sports as boxing, basketball, and football with men, the dynamic of the game would change too much for it to be played well.\n\nThough girls and women are increasingly being included in a variety of sports, there seems to be a threshold as to which sports can be coed and at which level of play. For instance, according to a 2010 study by the The Journal of Sports Science and Medicine, “The data that they collected and examined showed that, on average, men outperform women by a 10 percent gap” (Sanders, Alice). This percent difference is huge, actually. This means the best women athletes in the world would not be able to qualify for men’s Olympic sports, let alone get into top places of the competitions.\n\nThis 10 percent gap becomes even more prominent when speed and strength are heavily involved. Take weight lifting for example. Even if women take steroids, they cannot seriously compete with the top 100 male weight lifters of the world. Take for instance the Olympic world records for most weight lifted. Lasha Talakhadze, a man, lifted a total of 473 kilograms at the 2016 Rio De Janeiro Olympics (current world record), while a woman named Zhou Lulu (the current record holder in the Olympics for women) lifted a total of 333 kilograms. That is an astounding difference of over 100 kilograms in comparison between the strongest man and woman in weight lifting.\n\nBesides a comparison in strength, speed is also a major reason there is a differentiation between genders in sports. The world record for men in the 100-meter dash is 9.58 seconds, which is held by Usain Bolt. On the other hand, the world record for women is 10.49 seconds, completed by Florence Griffith-Joyner. This does not put the women’s record even within the 100 runs in history (Avila, Michael). This demonstrates that while women can be quite fast, they cannot professionally compete in contests of speed when men are in the equation.\n\nFeminism has advanced the civil rights of women worldwide, and its efforts are highly commendable. However, we cannot ignore the differences in speed and strength between professional male and female athletes. Even some female athletes have acknowledged this disparity. Serena Williams, recognized as the greatest female tennis player of all time, said that, “If I were to play Andy Murray, I would lose, 6-0, 6-0, in five to six minutes, maybe 10 minutes. The men are a lot faster, they serve harder, they hit harder. … It’s a completely different game” (Abad-Santos, Alex). If the best female tennis player in the world can honestly talk about this issue, then we should be able to as well.\n\nGender equality is positive in almost all spheres of activity. However, in sports that involve the heavy use of strength and speed, seeking gender equality would not be scientifically appropriate. It has been shown through records that the top male athletes are stronger and faster than the top female athletes by a significant margin—enough for them to not be able to compete with the top 100 male athletes in any given sport that focuses on strength and\/or speed. In light of this, the inclusion of girls and women in sports has a certain threshold that cannot be physically crossed.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of adding more days to the public school calendar?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In The U.S., there is a crisis in public education. Basically, American public education stands somewhere in the middle of country rankings in terms of testing in reading, mathematics, and science (DeSilver, Drew). Even though we have the largest economy in the world (Smith, Rob), we seem to not be able to develop great standard education. Knowing that education is the foundation of any major nation, it seems plausible that to increase our students’ test scores, pupils should spend more days at school, or at least engage in more hours of study. There are already about 520,000 students who study at school for extended hours (“Raise Achievement”), and below is a discussion about why this educational revolution needs to happen.\n\nThough we have as many or more instructional hours put into a school year than most countries, the amount of days our students spend at school is quite low compared to competing nations. This method seems like a formula for failure, as the countries with more school days but less instructional hours do better on test scores (Drehle, David Von). Though there has been a proposal in the U.S. called “Extended school time,” so far, it has only been implemented in some states, showing excellent results (“Raise Achievement”). This demonstrates that since individual states are achieving better test results, then the entire nation would benefit from such an initiative.\n\nBesides great improvement on test scores, more days of study in public education can better reflect the working schedule of parents and guardians. Catherine Brown, Vice President of Education Policy at the Center for American Progress, says that, “Schools make it really hard for working parents—and particularly, working moms—to fulfill all their responsibilities. Better aligning school and work schedules ought to be a core component of a progressive agenda to help working families” (“A 9 To 5 School Day: Are Longer Hours Better for Students and Educators?”). And another note: many families are single-parent units that have trouble keeping their children’s lives organized and adapting their schedules to their children’s school times.\n\nThere is also the fact of adapting to other interests. Many subjects are simply not covered because of a lack of time and a strong focus on receiving good test scores in mandatory subjects. According to the Seattle PI, “A longer school day would allow schools to spend more time on art, music, social studies, science and physical education. These subjects have been cut back through the years to focus on English and math in the hopes of boosting test scores. Yet test scores have remained stagnant, and students have missed out on a more well-rounded education” (Bean-Mellinger, Barbara). A more comprehensive education commonly develops mandatory classwork. Children who are better at music, art, and other creative activities have been shown to increase their intelligence and diligence.\n\nUnfortunately, the United States stands only about average in world rankings for mathematics reading, and science testing, despite it being an economic and political superpower. This means that our standard education needs to be changed. It seems that the main issue is that students do not spend enough days at school, as countries that spend more days at school as compared to the U.S. generally outperform in terms of test scores. Adding more days to the public educational calendar would increase test scores, make it easier for parents to align their schedules with their children, and also allow the school system to focus on more creative and neglected studies that are essential for a growing child. Thus, we should make this initiative a nationwide phenomenon.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages of online education?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" During Medieval times, education was a privilege of the chosen few. As time passed, studying at any kind of school became obligatory. Education began to be seen as a right, and even some kind of civic duty. Nowadays, it is difficult to meet a person (at least in the western world), who has not studied anywhere for at least a year. Depending on the country, education may be more-or-less affordable; for example, in Denmark it is free, whereas in the United States, students have to take out enormous loans to pay for a college or university, which they then have to pay off throughout many years.\n\nAt the same time, going to a higher education institution is not the only option one has nowadays. The Internet–the place where it is possible to find anything–has become a perfect solution for those who strive to learn something new, but have no possibility or desire to go to college. Although online education may not seem to be substantial enough compared to the traditional one, it possesses a number of solid advantages you should consider.\n\nFirst of all, online education means comfort (eLearning Industry). Studying in a college or university often equates to moving to a different city, handing over loads of money, living on campus (which is not always a nice change in life), and having to go out no matter how horrible the weather outside is. Studying online, you get yourself rid of all these drawbacks. Regardless of whether you are at home, on vacation, or having a lunch break in the office, all you need to learn something new is your laptop and an Internet connection. Rather often, online education portals such as Udemy or Coursera offer the possibility to study offline by simply watching videos made by an instructor, and completing assignments whenever it is convenient for students.\n\nSecondly, online education is much more affordable than the traditional one. For example, on Udemy, you can find all kinds of educational programs whose prices often stay in the range of $180-200 (and much cheaper during discount seasons). Coursera, in its turn, along with regular paid courses, also offers a variety of free educational materials available for everyone. Of course, not all of the online degrees offer cheaper prices, but due to the absence of commuting costs and other factors, studying online proves to be more accessible–especially for younger people. Studying materials and\/or textbooks, as well as other resources, are often included in the price for an online course, so you do not have to purchase it separately. Moreover, nowadays, credits earned via online courses are accepted by a growing number of educational institutions, which in general increases the value and usefulness of MOOC–massive open online courses (OEDB).\n\nFinally, you can study at your own pace (eLearning Industry). Educational institutions, be it high schools or universities, have to focus on an average student–a John Doe whose cognitive and intellectual capabilities are some kind of an arithmetical mean. The disciplines you will study, the methods of education, teachers, and the academic environment are not yours to choose. At the same time, the Internet gives you the opportunity to study as much as you want, with any teacher or instructor you like. Many courses online have demo videos showing an instructor’s manner of teaching, giving an overview of a course program, and allowing you to make an informed choice. You can watch one video per day, or you can finish an entire course in a week–you can do whatever is convenient to you.\n\nIt can be said that nowadays, online courses have become a great option for everyone willing to master a specific area of knowledge, but not willing (or having costs, possibilities, etc.) to enter a college or university. Studying online is convenient, can be pursued for much lesser prices than traditional education, and can be performed at an individual pace. Online degrees and certificates are in no way inferior to regular ones, so why hesitate?###"}
{"prompt":"What are some benefits of procrastination?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Perhaps every person on Earth has at least once been in a situation when he or she has an urgent task to do, but instead of challenging it head on, he or she postpones working on this task for as long as possible. This delay can take various forms: from doing nothing, to doing a lot of work–just not the work that should be done. The phenomenon described here is called procrastination, and its roots go much deeper than mere laziness.\n\nUsually, people tend to see procrastination as something bad. They invent dozens of strategies how to stop procrastinating and increase their efficiency, forgetting about the fact that like many other psychological mechanisms, procrastination serves its own purpose, and probably even carries a message worth decrypting. So, instead of blaming yourself for being lazy, the next time you procrastinate, try to look past it, and figure out what is happening to you. Most likely, procrastination is your friend. Why?\n\nThere are several arguments proving this thesis. First of all, it helps you figure out your most pressing priorities. Usually, you will not procrastinate over some minor task such as sharpening a pencil or drinking a glass of water. Problems start when there is something important or difficult that needs to be done. Reasons withholding you from doing work can be different, but here is a clue to remember: try to figure out what exactly makes you shirk–as a rule, it should be exactly what is your top priority task at the moment (Psychology Today). A pressing matter, an urgent document that needs to be written by the end of the day, an especially difficult piece of work, whatever. On the other hand, procrastination may serve you as an indicator that you are doing something wrong, or that you are pushing yourself too hard and need to take some time to rest. Either way, the means you use to overcome procrastination is a different story; so far, try seeing procrastination as a marker, an index–and you will discover that it can be quite useful.\n\nFor many people, the decision-making process is a troubling one. This varies depending on the weight of a decision that needs to be made. Making up one’s mind to marry another person may take months, whereas choosing between orange and pineapple juice is usually a piece-of-cake decision (surprisingly, there are people for whom this is the opposite). And, as a general rule, when they have to make an important decision, people tend to procrastinate. Although we often scold ourselves for indecisiveness–and sometimes our friends and relatives may press us as well–in fact, procrastinating in this case is also beneficial. According to Frank Partnoy, the author of the book Wait: The Art and Science of Delay, in this case procrastination is a signal for you to slow down. During this break, you are supposed take your time to weigh all possible options, gather more information, and make a decision based on the knowledge you obtain (Bustle).\n\nSurprisingly enough, procrastination can even help you fix a relationship with another person. If you had a fight, for example, there is a period of time when whatever you say to each other will most likely be perceived with skepticism or even hostility. Besides, you might have noticed how unwilling you may be when having to apologize in front of a different person–even if it was you who was wrong. In this case, procrastination may give you enough time to make up your mind, find your courage, and think of the proper words (or actions) for an apology. The same works for another person: after a cooldown period, he or she will be more susceptible to what you have to say (Psychology Today). Use this to your advantage.\n\nAs we can see, procrastination is not necessarily a bad thing. Unlike many people got used to believing, procrastination is not a negative trait of character such as laziness, but rather a psychological mechanism, the main function of which is to slow you down and give you enough time to sort out your priorities, gather information before making an important decision, or finding proper words to make your amends with another person. Thus, instead of avoiding and denying procrastination, you might want to embrace it–at least sometimes.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the likelihood of intelligent extraterrestrial life existing in the universe?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The debates about whether sentient life is a unique phenomenon in our universe or not has lasted decades. From dogmatic beliefs about humanity having been created by a deity, public opinion has mostly moved to a more flexible, diverse outlook. Since it became known that there is life out there, experts have mostly debated about the possibility of an intelligent, self-conscious species existing somewhere in space.\n\nSome believe if alien life does exist, it is necessarily better developed than humanity. It is supposed to possess a progressive culture, faster-than-light spaceflight secrets, and advanced technologies and weapons. The thought about humanity being inferior to alien species provokes fear, which has been manifested in popular culture for the last hundred years. Others think that even if there is sentient life in space, it does not necessarily outstrip the human race in terms of development. It is possible that such a race would be stuck in its own analog of our medieval epoch, with the most advanced technology in its possession being gunpowder. Or, it could be a race of primitive hunting animals with bows and spears, living in tribes, and dancing around bonfires.\n\nAnyways, what matters is that talks about the possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life moved from “whether” to “how common?” To prove this thesis, let us take a look at the arguments its proponents come forward with.\n\nAccording to one recent study, chances that we are not alone in the universe are significant: approximately one in 10 billion trillion chances. It may look like a ridiculously small possibility, but let us not forget about the number of stars in one galaxy that we live in, or about the number of galaxies in our local galaxy cluster, or about the number of galaxy clusters that exist in the universe. In fact, considering the enormous scales of the world we live in, 10 billion trillion to one does not look insignificant anymore. This proportion was derived based on the famous Drake equation, and implies that advanced extraterrestrial civilizations may not just exist, but could have developed and disappeared before. This is what Adam Frank, the lead author of the study, says: “One in 10 billion trillion is incredibly small. To me, this implies that other intelligent, technology producing species very likely have evolved before us […] Think of it this way. Before our result, you’d be considered a pessimist if you imagined the probability of evolving a civilization on a habitable planet were, say, one in a trillion. But even that guess, one chance in a trillion, implies that what has happened here on Earth with humanity has in fact happened about 10 billion other times over cosmic history, owing to the estimated number of stars and planets in the universe!” (IFL Science).\n\nIndeed, we tend to underestimate such seemingly small probabilities, completely forgetting about the fact that in the scales of universe, even one out of 10 billion trillion means an unimaginably huge number of chances. This alone could serve as valid proof for the claim that humanity is not alone in the universe, but there is more to it.\n\nSeveral decades ago, scientists only predicted there could be planets other than Earth that would have conditions suitable for life on them to emerge. However, not so long ago it turned out that there are exoplanets that have conditions almost similar to those that organic life on Earth itself enjoys. In 2014, NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope detected such a planet in the so-called habitable zone of Kepler. Called Kepler-186f, this planet is believed to be just one out of many other similar planets scattered across the galaxy. In fact, some astronomers believe almost every star in the Milky Way has a planet orbiting around it. Considering the statistics mentioned above, it is possible that many of these planets are inhabited, and some could be even home to intelligent alien species. Sara Seager, professor of planetary science and physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says: “Sometime in the near future, people will be able to point to a star and say, ‘that star has a planet like Earth’” (Huffpost).\n\nAnd she is not alone in her claims. Moreover, many scientists are extremely optimistic about unveiling the truth, claiming that in the next decades, we will know for sure we are not alone in space. Charles Bolden, a former astronaut and currently NASA administrator, says: “Do we believe there is life beyond Earth? I would venture to say that most of my colleagues here today say it is improbable that in the limitless vastness of the universe we humans stand alone.” Kevin Hand, NASA astronomer suggesting there already is alien life existing on Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons, is even more specific: “I think in the next 20 years, we will find out we are not alone in the universe” (CBS Connecticut).\n\nSo far, humanity has no empirical evidence of intelligent alien life existing somewhere in the universe. However, there is strong mathematical proof of such a probability, and there is the experience and knowledge of NASA astronomers who believe life outside Earth  exists. Our universe is an incredibly large place. Earth is a tiny hydrogen molecule in the vast ocean of space–and it would be extremely arrogant to think that it is the only place where the miracle of life could have emerged.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages of using laptops in class?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" For hundreds of years, education has been closely connected to writing. Professors had been writing down their lectures, and students had been keeping notes after their teachers. Goose feathers and parchment changed to ballpoint pens and paper, but the essence has remained the same: knowledge passed down from one person to another must be thoroughly recorded.\n\nWith the emergence and development of mobile technologies such as laptops and smartphones, using conventional methods is gradually becoming obsolete. Students tend to use laptops in class more often than pens and paper. And although there are still many educational institutions that prohibit or decry using computers in class, there are many arguments in favor of doing so.\n\nFirst of all, let us face reality: people do not write as much today as they used to several years ago. This is especially true in the case of the youth: teenagers and young adults tend to feel more confident and comfortable typing on their devices rather than with handwriting. Keeping records after a teacher in class requires a student to write extremely fast, which often decreases the readability of the notes taken. Sometimes it can be extremely difficult for a student to understand what he or she hurriedly wrote down in class (Study Breaks). At the same time, typing on a laptop helps write the important information down in a comprehensible and accurate way. Also, handwriting always involves grammatical mistakes, typos, blots, and so on. Obviously, students experience little-to-none of such problems while using computers.\n\nSecondly, technology is something youth nowadays have got so accustomed to that without it, they operate less efficiently. Students are native to such devices as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other gadgets, and naturally incorporate them in whatever they do, be it leisure time or studying (EdTech). Not allowing students to use tablets in class means to deprive them of something that is almost a part of them and of their daily lives. If young people know how to use technology to their advantage and increase their studying effectiveness with its help, why forbid them from doing it?\n\nThe usage of mobile technologies helps make the studying process more intuitive, fluent, and engaging for students. For example, there are teachers who like to illustrate their lectures with photographs, charts, or interactive graphics. If students are using laptops, a teacher can send them supplementary educational materials via email or in social media. Or, students may be able to look up contradictory and\/or insufficient information during the course or a lecture, and ask questions immediately. Laptops also allow changing the format of teaching. Some teachers develop experimental ways of lecturing, and these new methods tend to show promising results. For example, in the Allendale School District, laptops are used to help students turn any place they are present in into a classroom. Using laptops, Paul Mulder, the Allendale Public Schools technology director, lectures students while they are at their homes or elsewhere, providing them with all the necessary materials online. Later, he and his students gather in class and discuss the material they learned together (Learning Liftoff). Needless to say that such formats of studying are more appealing to young people who value their freedom and time, and prove to be extremely effective.\n\nWe live in the 21st century, and it is difficult to keep adhering to old ways when each day brings on innovations of different kinds. Education is not an exception to these processes of rapid evolution; conventional methods are quickly becoming obsolete. Students nowadays need to have these innovations seamlessly incorporated into their studying processes. Allowing them to use laptops in class would be a small but substantial change. Modern students are digital natives, and can effectively use technologies to their advantage. They would be able to not just take notes on lectures more effectively, but would also eagerly engage in new forms of studying such as remote studying, using interactive online materials, and so on.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of overpopulation and natural disasters that make space colonization a necessary step for humanity?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The times when space flight was something unimaginable are long gone. It is hardly something mundane and habitual: each spacecraft launch requires large sums of money and the effort of hundreds of people. But still, when we talk about flying to space, we hardly hold our breath. Thanks to the Internet and modern technologies, anyone can watch broadcasts of orbital stations, with astronauts living there for months. Elon Musk and his SpaceX initiative has become something people expect to work out, not just a billionaire’s fantasy. Scientists discuss the possibilities of constructing rocket engines able to pierce the fabric of space. Human beings had even set feet on the Moon’s surface, which can be seriously called the first step towards space colonization. The the latter, by the way, has also turned from a science-fiction fantasy into a vital need. Why?\n\nThere are multiple factors pushing humanity into outer space. Some people understand it, some do not, but in several decades it will become obvious to everyone that there is no other way. The opponents of space colonization often claim there still are problems on Earth that need to be solved before leaving it behind. Another popular opinion is that since humanity has already polluted one planet, it should not be allowed to colonize and pollute other worlds. Arguments against space colonization include other appeals to emotions and reason. For instance, the fact that it will take hundreds if not thousands of years to reach the closest exoplanet suitable for inhabiting is something scientists must yet find a solution to. The absence of cryogenic anabiosis or other similar technologies will make travelling even to Mars (about seven years of flight) a harsh challenge. No one knows how the human body will react to prolonged conditions of zero gravity, or which psychological problems the future colonists will encounter. The sums of money needed to build and sustain even the most basic colony on another planet will be astronomical. And still, there is no other choice for humanity.\n\nTo start with, it is already obvious that Earth is suffering from overpopulation. And the problem is not just in over seven billion people walking the surface of the planet. Overpopulation means the lack of food and water, the most basic resources needed for a human being to survive. Why? Because food does not materialize from thin air. In order to produce food, vast territories are needed for farming and cattle breeding. Agriculture exhausts soil and pollutes natural water reservoirs. Pesticides and other chemicals used to grow crops negatively impact the ozone layer of Earth, and saturates the air with chemicals. The more people live on the planet, the more substantial the scales of these problems are. Overpopulation means the lack of living space. Enormous skyscrapers in Hong Kong are built for living, not for business; condensed and crammed Japanese cities with tiny apartments and no free space for trees; slums of India and crowded cities of China–so far, these problems have mostly touched only Asian countries, since the density of population is higher there. However, in about a decade, this state of matters might become common all over the world. In addition, more people means less jobs, lower life expectancy, the depletion of natural resources, an increase of crime, and poorer sanitary conditions (Everything Connects). Cutting a long story short, overpopulation alone can make Earth a place unpleasant to live.\n\nNatural disasters is another danger many people tend to underestimate. The tragedy that occurred in Japan in 2011, when thousands of people died or vanished without a trace, and a nuclear reactor leaked radiation into the ocean, showed how helpless the humanity is against the forces of nature. One earthquake and one tsunami caused enormous damage to the whole nation, and it took years to eliminate the material aftermath of the catastrophe. Volcanic eruptions are also something no one can feel safe about. For some reason, people believe that volcanoes are mostly dangerous because of spitting out liquid fire and hot air, whereas perhaps the biggest danger is ashes and toxic evaporation. The eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 led to a transport collapse in Europe–airplanes could not fly because of the air filled with particles of dust and ash. Sulfur and fluorine emissions released in large quantities during almost any eruption can cause serious health problems for people who inhale them. Finally, an eruption large enough can cause severe climatic changes on a global level, leading to weather conditions similar to a nuclear winter and global cooling.\n\nOne of such eruptions happened in Iceland in 1783 when a tectonic fissure Laki started spitting lava and smoke for a period of eight months. The river Skafta–a broad water reservoir flowing near the village of Kirkjubæjarklaustur–evaporated; instead of water, the riverbed was filled with lava. Fluorine emissions killed huge numbers of cattle and people in Iceland and northern Europe. The eruption was so intense that it caused climatic changes in Africa, suppressing the Nile’s summer floods in Egypt, thus affecting the harvest and causing famine. About 142,000 people died because of that eruption–and who knows what else our planet is capable of (Historical Climatology).\n\nBesides, it is not only our planet that can be a source of natural disasters, but outer space as well. Perhaps everyone knows what happened to dinosaurs: due to the fall of a large asteroid the whole planet got covered by an impenetrable layer of dust that caused global cooling and leaded to the extinction of thousands of flora and fauna species, including the dinosaurs. Who can guarantee that no such asteroid will fall on Earth in the future?\n\nIn addition, colonizing other planets may lead humanity towards incredible technological and scientific discoveries. The Universe is a place endlessly rich with wonders. The methane seas of Titan, the water frozen right under the surface of Mars, the drifting continents of Pluto–these are just some of the mysteries our Solar System possesses, and it is merely a tiny spot compared to our galaxy. Each new planet the humanity colonizes is a potential source of invaluable discoveries and breakthroughs (Research Summary).\n\nDespite what skeptics think, the colonization of space is something humanity needs to do in order to survive as a species. Overpopulation and the problems originating from it such as famine, pandemics, and crime, is perhaps the most pressing issue so far. However, the possibility of natural disasters such as an asteroid falling on Earth, or a massive earthquake causing tsunami and volcanic eruptions, can cause millions of deaths worldwide. For the sake of generations living tomorrow, people should start thinking about leaving Earth today.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the effects of sleep deprivation?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" All of us have received advice to “take a good rest” at least once in our lives. Probably, this is also one of the most neglected pieces of advice a person may give to another. With the ever-increasing pace of life, especially in big cities, sufficient rest–and sleep, in particular–is gradually becoming more of a luxury than a basic need that should be addressed and satisfied. Everyone knows how sleep is important: health experts, psychologists, self-help books, and other authoritative sources keep talking about the importance of having good sleep–and still exhaustion and fatigue remain one of the biggest problems in a number of developed countries.\n\nPerhaps, this is just not enough to make people pay attention to the problem. Supposedly, it would be more convincing to learn about the negative effects of sleep deprivation, poor quality sleep, or just constantly ignoring one’s need for restoration and rest. This essay discusses some of the crippling (and sometimes surprising) effects a simple lack of sleep can do to a person’s mind and body.\n\nFirst of all, if you ever wondered how someone with schizophrenia or other severe mental disease feels, a sleepless night could get you closer to this condition. As researchers from the University of Bonn and King’s College London discovered, upon missing a night of sleep, a psychologically-healthy person may experience symptoms typical for some forms of schizophrenia. During the course of the experiment, which led the scientists to such a conclusion, a group of people was offered to first have a night of normal sleep, and then to stay awake by conversations, games, and physical activities. After this, test subjects were to undergo prepulse inhibition measurements. Prepulse is a psychological mechanism helping the brain to filter incoming sensory information: with its help, our minds distinguish between important and unimportant stimuli coming from the environment. After just one sleepless night, this function turned out to be inhibited significantly. Test subjects reported altered bodily sensations, distorted perception, and weird ideas: for instance, some of them believed they could read thoughts. They also became more sensitive to light and loud noises (Universitat Bonn). After having a good rest, perception returns back to normal, but it takes time to return all psychological and physical functions back to its usual state. In the case of prolonged sleep deprivation, some consequences may be irreversible.\n\nDo you enjoy feeling depressed? Or do you like mood swings, when periods of euphoria quickly change to severe blues? If the answer is yes, then sleep deprivation is for you. Numerous research studies conducted in different sleep laboratories showed that people who did not have enough sleep, or have been deprived of it for certain periods of time, tend to be more irritable and less able to control their negative emotions. They are also more likely to react negatively to something they do not like, even if the trigger is not significant. This is not to mention the increased likeliness of developing depression. Besides, the lack of sleep inhibits friendliness and empathy, and impairs one’s ability to stay in a positive mood (Psychology Today). In addition, if you have such mental conditions as obsessive-compulsive disorder or chronic depression, their symptoms may become more acute as well. In any case, to avoid prolonged periods of negative mood, you might want to sleep well regularly.\n\nAs if it was not enough, sleepless nights can affect your body in a negative way as well. There have been numerous research studies proving that people having problems with falling or staying asleep also had other health issues as well. In particular, sleepless nights can lead to increased risks of heart attacks and failures, strokes, diabetes, and increased blood pressure. Poor sleep can also kill your sex drive, regardless of your gender. In particular, both men and women who suffer from sleep deprivation reported lowered interest in sex and decreased libido in general. In particular, poor sleep caused by the apnea syndrome–a widespread health condition among men–was also connected to abnormally low levels of testosterone secretion during nighttime (WebMD).\n\nAmong other peculiar and unpleasant consequences of depriving yourself of sleep is the suppression of your immune system, weight gain, memory issues, and problems with concentration. This is not to mention the risk of getting into an accident because of decreased attentiveness and alertness (Healthline).\n\nOverall, there is a number of good reasons why you would not want to stay up the next time you feel like working or studying at night. In particular, you may experience altered perception, distortion of cognitive and memory functions, and the inability to concentrate and think straight. Also, your mood will be down, and it will become harder for you to control your negative emotions, such as anger or fear. As if this was not enough, your body suffers as well. In particular, people who regularly deprive themselves of sleep, develop higher risks of heart diseases and diabetes, and report lowered sex drive and libido. So, in general, there is probably nothing that would compensate you for a night spent without sleep.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of eating fast food?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Considering the ever-increasing pace of life in big cities, sometimes it can be easy to lose oneself in overwhelming routine. Being in a hurry all the time, a regular citizen may have no time for satisfying even basic needs such as sleep and nutrition. This is probably why seeing sleeping people in public transport is so common, and why fast food restaurants are crowded all the time. Sleep deprivation in big cities is a well-known problem, and people are gradually becoming more aware of the importance of sleep. In the case of fast food, however, things are not that simple. Even though the majority of people know about the dangers of eating food from McDonald’s, Burger King, Subway, and similar places, they still go there. The factors causing such behavior should be analyzed separately. Instead, this paper focuses on the reasons why you should quit eating fast food as soon as possible.\n\nThe most obvious reason everyone is aware of is the increased risk of developing obesity. Sometimes, being overweight is caused by health problems or psychological issues. However, much more often, becoming overweight is evoked by dysfunctional eating habits and the regular consumption of fast food. According to research, people eating fast food regularly develop much higher risks of gaining extra weight. They are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, not only adults are exposed to these risks–teenagers and children are also under threat. Throughout the last 30 years, the rates of adolescent obesity have tripled. For children, this index has doubled over the same period of time. This might be related to sophisticated advertising, but facts remain facts: fast food leads to obesity, and all age groups are at risk (Lifehack).\n\nUnlike organic food, which is by default created from pure, natural ingredients, fast food often has a bunch of dubious ingredients in it. To start with, all kinds of flavor enhancers are added into it so that it tastes and smells better. Conservatives and food preservatives may be used as well–in particular, tertiary butylhydroquinone, which is made from similar ingredients as petroleum. As if this was not enough, fast food may contain the remainders of drugs and antibiotics. How do they get in there? The good news is that fast food does contain real meat. The bad news is that animals are kept in such awful conditions that they often suffer from a number of diseases. To deal with this problem, fast food manufacturers may add antibiotics to animals’ nutrition–later, they can get into your body when you eat your next chicken burger (SheKnows).\n\nAlong with the risks of developing obesity and pumping your body with doubtful chemicals, eating fast food often means exposing almost every organ of your body to dangers. For example, it becomes much easier to get kidney diseases: because fast food is often salty and greasy, it increases blood pressure, makes you want to drink all kinds of soda drinks (which are unhealthy in their own way), and affects kidneys adversely. Besides, due to high amounts of cholesterol and triglyceride contained in fast food, your cardiovascular system suffers as well. This is not to mention the fact that processed fats in fries and other junk food, when supplied to the brain instead of nutrition, affect cognitive abilities in a negative way. In particular, according to research conducted on rats, a week of daily fast food consumption caused memory impairment in test subjects. And, as if this was not enough, junk food increases your chances to get cancer (Beauty and Tips).\n\nAs it can be seen, cheap and tasty food is not what your body needs. To start with, when eating fast food regularly, you put yourself (or your children, if you tolerate their fast food habits) at risk of developing obesity, and possibly type 2 diabetes. Some crucial organs of your body such as kidneys, heart, and brain, suffer from junk food immensely. And, if adverse health effects are not enough for you, think about preservatives, antibiotics, and other chemicals you stuff your body with when eating fast food.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of marriage?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is a common refrain nowadays: “I don’t want to get married. There is no meaning to it anymore, and it does not really matter.” However, the statistics say otherwise. Data has shown that married people are on average healthier, wealthier, and live longer. It does not matter if you want to abstain from marriage or not: the facts point to marriage being an overall beneficial practice for almost all spheres of human involvement.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that marriage makes one healthier. For instance, “Roberto Manfredini—a professor of Internal Medicine at the University of Ferrara in Italy—and colleagues pored over data from 35 studies conducted over the past several years which included 1.2 million subjects. After all was said and done, the global study—published in the Journal of Women’s Health —concluded that being married is in fact “associated with lower risk factors and better health status”’ (Entity). There are certain reasons for this: hypertension is lowered, dietary habits are improved, physical fitness is more regular, and health checks are done on a more consistent basis. The only negative health factor associated with marriage is that married people have a higher risk of becoming obese, especially men. With all this considered, it is clear that marriage makes you a healthier person overall.\n\nNot only are married couples healthier, they are wealthier on average than singletons. According to Today, “Couples who get and stay married can have as much as four times the wealth of their single or divorced peers. Experts say that’s not only because they can combine their salaries and share expenses once they get married” (Linn, Allison). In the first place, the people who are getting married are more affluent, religious, and more educated, which are all factors that can contribute to wealth. Secondly, living with another person is more fiscally conservative, as you often need only one thing for two or more people i.e. a dishwasher. Insurance can be shared, and also taxes can be lowered in the case of marriage, and especially with children. Thirdly, the main worker of the household can focus more on work while the home is being cleaned up. This means more working hours and more comfort at work with home-cooked meals and knowing that the home is being taken care of.\n\nLongevity is another factor in favor of getting and remaining married. Through many decades of research, it has been demonstrated that married couples live longer on average than single people. The reasons for this are that couples cook more, drink less alcohol, have more emotional support, have more companionship, are less prone to depression, have less stress, have more physical health checks, eat communally, smoke less, and have more support for healthy habits (The Daily Meal). So, not only will you be healthier and wealthier as a married person, but also live longer than those who choose to be single. This works out to be a more fulfilling life and a more happy one.\n\nIt is clearly shown through data and research that those who get married are better off than single people when it comes to health, wealth, and longevity. Though there are many benefits of being single as well, it seems that being married outweighs those pluses. In order for marriages to be advantageous, though, couples have to strive to be balanced, happy, and cooperative. Then, all this research can be realized.###"}
{"prompt":"How can we reform our sexual education system in America?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sex is a natural act between two individuals—hopefully through mutual consent. Being an intuitive act and ingrained in our genes through evolution, learning about sex from an early age is not that important. However, knowing about sexual diseases and how to defend against sexual predators is essential. But, I believe that either parents should teach their children about sex at their own discretion, or individuals should investigate sexual education on their own terms, as teaching about this delicate subject against the will of parents is wrong, the internet is full of such information, and that nearly 80% of sexually-active students had sex before receiving formal sexual education.\n\nThe majority of parents in American believe that sexual education is valuable. According to Leslie Kantor and Nicole Levitz, affiliates of Planned Parenthood, “More than 89 percent of parents that identified as Republicans or Democrats support including a wide range of topics in sex education including puberty, healthy relationships, abstinence, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and birth control in high school. In middle school, 78 percent or more of both parents that identified as Republicans and Democrats support the inclusion of those topics” (PLoS ONE). However, I would argue that even though most parents have faith in sexual education, this system should not be imposed on parents who do not agree with the methods and information integrated into sexual education in high school and middle school. Parents deserve the respect to make their own decisions on such a sensitive issue. Parents come from varying faiths, outlooks, and backgrounds. These elements should be considered when forcing children to be a part of sexual education.\n\nInstead of spending tons of money on sexual education, parents and children can look up a variety of information on the internet. The US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health states that, “At the federal level, the U.S. congress has continued to substantially fund AOUM, and in FY 2016, funding was increased to $85 million per year” (Hall, Kelli Stidham, et al). With this much cash being put into the “abstinence only until marriage” sexual education, you would think that the results would be promising. It is the opposite: around half of pregnancies in America are unintended (Guttmacher Institute). With the global average around 40% for unintended pregnancies, America is by no means a progressive nation in this respect (Time). We need an overhaul of sexual education, and parents taking initiative through electronic means is one method to turn this disaster of sexual education into a fruitful activity.\n\nThough the majority of parents put their faith in sexual education in schools, according to Times magazine, almost 80% of students between 15-17 years of age have been sexually active before receiving formal sexual education. And according to the Kinsey Institute, “the average age that kids first have sex is 16.9 for boys and 17.4 for girls” (Time). Rattling off more numbers, the U.S. has the highest rate of teen pregnancies across all developed nations.  This demonstrates that either sexual education in schools is either given too late, or it is not working effectively. Never mind the moral reasons for eliminating sexual education from schools, the numbers tell a terrible story of ineffectiveness and wasting money on something that can be taught at home with more focus, sensitivity, and personality.\n\nLearning about sex is best left to parents and one’s own devices, as the record for school sex education in America is atrocious. America leads the developed world in teen pregnancy rates and most children have been sexually active before receiving sexual education. We need to reform our sexual education at home and digitally, providing a way for children to accurately and effectively learn about what having sex entails and what are its pitfalls.###"}
{"prompt":"How can we perceive reality in its true form?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Most people do not stop to introspect about what reality really is. Usually, we use the word “reality” to mean what seems to be, or facts filtered through a biased lens. But, it seems there should be one reality. It should not be dependent on people’s perception of what reality is. Reality is not based on thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations. These three elements disrupt that perceiving of reality. So, what is reality then?\n\nIn order to perceive reality in its true form, we should not add the filter of our thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations. Reality is simply what it is—nothing more, nothing less. It is said by science that reality is what is most fundamental, and that can be expressed through mathematics. The construction of the entirety of mathematics can be done with an empty set (The New Scientist). This nothingness, or blank sheet of existence, is reality. The state of consciousness without thought, feeling, or sensation is our original state. As long as we are injecting thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations into what we perceive, we are experiencing reality through a filter. For an example, you see a chair. If you see the chair without any thought, feeling, and physical sensation interrupting or changing how you perceive it, the chair will simply be. Without thinking that a chair is a chair (or other thoughts), or feeling something for the chair, or having a physical response to the chair, it is experienced as intended. In fact, all existence is one—the separation is made in our minds.\n\nBecause we have given names to everything we interact with, because we have classified each living and non-living being we have encountered in its minutest detail, because we have delineated specifics and aspects of each thing we study, we have created a mass concept about the separation of things. Reality is simply one existence, and that can be proven by physics, which states that no empty space is possible (The Daily Galaxy). Everything is connected, whether we like it or not. The chair that I am sitting on right now to type this essay is connected to rocks on Mars. Existence is a crowded place, but only if we conceptualize it as containing an innumerable array of entities.\n\nReality is whole, but it is also a place of contradictions. Though the universe is set to balance itself, it is also heading towards a state of chaos and disorder, expressed in the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Though locally we can balance ecosystems and such, on the whole, our existence is gradually becoming more and more chaotic (Philosophy Stack Exchange). However, there are theories that the universe is cyclical, and a new universe would spring up after entropy would have increased to its maximum (Princeton University). This may be only speculation, though. Even if the universe remained in disorder in the far future, we would all be a part of it. Looking back at the beginning, everything in its existence now was formed from the Big Bang—and as the famous phrase says, we are all stardust (physics.org). Each being that comprises reality carries on from the material from the Big Bang, all the way to the future maximum entropy. In essence, we are the Big Bang, and so is future existence.\n\nFrom a chair to the whole universe, reality is the same. Without the injection of thoughts, feeling, and physical sensations, all reality is one. We can perceive reality in its true form by not using these injections. Can you imagine a world where people gave up their identifications? In my opinion, all the follies of human beings would be extinguished, and Earth would restore its balance, despite that in all probability, we are headed for universal disorder.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of learning foreign languages?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, a Czech sociologist and philosopher, said once, “As many languages you know, as many times you are a human being.” It is difficult to deny the wisdom of these words. Every language is not just a number of rules and grammatical constructions allowing you to understand other people; it is rather a reflection (and at the same time—a determinant) of mentality, the way of thinking of the people who speak it. Learning a language ideally involves not only memorizing a bunch of new words, but also studying its native country’s culture and history, digging into its contemporary context, following its evolution. Believe it or not, but your native language has shaped your personality in the same way your parents and surroundings have. Logically, the more languages you know, the more diverse and profound of a person you can become; by understanding paradigms different from yours, you can broaden your outlook and become more open-minded; you will be able to read between the lines, developing your communications with other people not just in a regular—verbal—way, but in the dimension of gestures, circumlocutions, allegories, etc. You can view it as adopting and integrating a new personality in your mind, which occurs every time you dig deeper into a new language.\n\nOf course, there are more pragmatic and less philosophical reasons to begin studying foreign languages. Since ancient times, people who could communicate with foreigners have been valued greatly. Commerce, diplomacy, and cultural exchange would be difficult or even impossible if there were no people able to converse with the representatives of other countries. Nowadays, the situation has not changed much, even despite the existence of numerous computer-assisted translation tools. Try having business correspondence with a Japanese company using only Google Translate or any of the more advanced tools, and you will realize how inferior they are compared to a real translator or interpreter. Considering that nowadays there are many companies expanding their business abroad, the demand for qualified people speaking at least one foreign language is extremely high. Even if you will not be travelling around the world all the time, you will still be more valued at work (Fluentin3months). Besides, it will be easier for you to find a job in a different country.\n\nBesides your career, there are many other reasons for learning a foreign language. Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you are alone in an unfamiliar country, unable to find your hostel two hours past midnight, and completely unable to say anything in this country’s language? You approach people with a silly smile on your face (you hope it looks polite, but in fact it is rather suspicious), trying to show them your map; some of them ignore you, others nod their heads and start talking quickly, pointing their fingers in all directions—but you cannot understand them. Finally, you find a taxi driver who agrees to help you, and as a result, your ride takes about five minutes, and the driver charges you a hundred dollars. As weird as it may sound to a person from an English-speaking environment, the rest of the world does not speak English; in some countries—European countries, for example—you will find people able to communicate in it, but usually, the farther to the South or to the East you travel, the less English-speaking people you will be able to find. Now, imagine how great it would be to travel to China, for instance, and to have the following conversation:\n\n– Hello! Can you help me?\n– Wow!\n– What?\n– You speak Chinese!\n– Oh, yes, a little bit.\n– That’s cool, I’ve never met a foreigner able to speak Chinese.\n– Well, I just like studying foreign languages. Do you know what transport I should take to get to this hostel (you show it on your map)?\n– Oh, you don’t need transport—the hostel is just two blocks away from here. Just walk down this street till you see the crossroad, and then turn right, and you should see it.\n– Great! Thanks for your help.\n– You’re welcome. Enjoy your stay in China.\n\nWhen we are at home and a tourist asks us directions, we take it for granted that he or she speaks English. Sometimes we cringe because of their accents or twisted grammar; however, in other countries, people are more grateful when you try to speak their language, and you can find even more help than you are required.\n\nBesides, being able to speak a foreign language can save you a whole lot of money and\/or time. If you are a regular English-speaking tourist, you have two options to get to your destination from the airport: either by a shuttle, which is slow (and once you miss one for some reason, you have to wait for a long time until another one arrives), or by taxi, which can cost you a fortune. However, when talking to people in the airport, you can rather often find an alternative; for example, you can learn about a cheaper local bus, or you can run into a person who will agree to drive you up to the city for free, or for a considerably lower sum of money than a taxi (FluentU). This works especially well in poorer countries, where locals are eager to earn some extra coin.\n\nThis is not to mention you can easily make new friends from abroad. Even if you are a reserved or introverted person, when abroad, you have to communicate with other people—otherwise, you will not be able to enjoy your travel and sustain yourself. Besides, if you are staying in a hostel or a guest house, the atmosphere of numerous strangers from all over the world gathered at one place often disposes and inspires communication. Sometimes, connections you make when travelling can last for years, transforming into friendships, business contacts, or even romantic relationships. All this is not possible (or would be much harder to achieve) if you do not speak a foreign language (Lingholic).\n\nLearning foreign languages is extremely beneficial for personal development. Not only does it allow you to better understand other cultures and mentalities, but it also enriches your personality with new outlooks, makes you more open-minded—which is extremely valuable nowadays. Besides, speaking at least one foreign language can significantly improve your travelling experience, help you make new friends from abroad, and start business or romantic relationships. In addition, professionals who speak foreign languages are more valued by their companies, and often get a chance to work in different countries. Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk used to say, “As many languages you speak, as many times you are a human being,” and it is definitely true.###"}
{"prompt":"How can meditation be used to achieve world peace?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" We have the United Nations, UNESCO, the Global Peace Foundation, the International Peace Institute, and many more organizations that strive to bring peace to a constantly chaotic world. Despite innumerable organizations existing that tackle catastrophes and injustices, the world seems as troubled as ever. Why is that? I believe it is because we are not removing the root of the problem, which is inner turmoil among the masses, and specifically in people of power. With the practice of meditation, this inner turmoil could be settled in the general population and ultimately among people of influence. We have been essentially cutting off the sharp thorns of a plant, instead of uprooting it. Trimming a problem down to size allows it to grow back and to haunt us again. I see meditation, as a vehicle of inner transformation, to be the primary instrument to obtain world peace.\n\nBut first, we should define what meditation is. Meditation, at its most fundamental level, is the absence of thought, and complete awareness. Why is this state important to achieve in our present world? If we believe in negative thoughts, we not only set ourselves on a dangerous path of self-destruction but also the destruction of others (Firestone, Lisa).\n\nSo, integrating meditation into each society as a primary way of balance and anti-destruction will keep world calamities at bay. How exactly? All the decisions relating to the taking of people’s lives due to hatred, all the ideas of corruption, all the campaigns to take advantage of poor people, and all local crimes stem from negative thinking. With the daily practice of meditation, these negative thoughts either dissipate or are not heeded (Beyond The Mind).\n\nThere have been controlled studies on the effects of meditation, particularly of meditation centered on the state of awareness without the engagement of thoughts, that show that people can easily and profoundly be affected by meditation. According to the website Beyond The Mind, the largest and most professional study on the positive effects of meditation was done by Dr. Ramesh Manocha: “Dr. Ramesh Manocha is an Australian GP and researcher based at the Discipline of Psychiatry, Sydney Medical School, Sydney University, where he coordinates the Meditation Research Programme. For the past 15 years, he has conducted clinical trials and scientific investigations into the practical applications of meditation. As a result, he is now recognized as a leading authority in this field” (Beyond The Mind). The studies concluded that people’s stress levels dropped significantly, and that negative thinking was largely reduced during and after meditation sessions. In addition, ailments such as asthma and ADD were profoundly curbed and even eliminated. If these effects were replicated throughout the world, the world would know a newfound peace.\n\nFrom the disappearance of negative thoughts and garnered balance, to healing physical and psychological ailments, meditation, if practiced on a global scale, could be the solution to world calamities. Though it seems to be an innocuous practice, the transformation of the general public, and most essentially, of people in power, could bring about a new era of peace. Science backs this claim up, and so do countless people’s experiences with overcoming their negativities. Why not make this a global initiative, especially in light of global organizations having ultimately no solution to the ensuing chaos of the world.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some advantages of owning an iPhone over an Android device?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The time we live in can be fairly called the epoch of mobile devices. Every time you use public transport, have a lunch break, attend a meeting, or walk down the street, you will see people staring at their phones, tablets, smart watches, and other gadgets, completely absorbed in their blueish glow. In developed countries, it has become almost impossible to imagine a person having no smartphone or its substitutes, since the pace of modern life has become intertwined with the usage of mobile gadgets; the variety of models available on the market is overwhelming, and a person facing the need to choose a gadget may experience difficulties. Which model is better? What about the camera? How long will the battery last? Can I run games on it? What are the specifications? These are some questions an average consumer may have when browsing shops in search of a new gadget.\n\nNowadays, there are two giants holding a monopoly on the market of mobile devices: Apple with its iOS, and Google with its Android OS. Although the latter is more affordable and often as efficient than the former, there are many people who prefer Apple products despite their price tags. If you browse the Internet, you will find tons of blog posts, articles, comparisons, and videos, each arguing in favor of either Apple or Android. If you are looking for a new smartphone, and have not yet decided which brand to choose, let us try to analyze the reasons why you might want to consider buying an iPhone (not necessarily the latest model).\n\nFirst of all, iPhones are extremely easy to use. When one starts to use a new Android device, a user has to go through a number of setup instructions, confirm policies, and so on; in the case of an iPhone, you just turn it on, and it is ready to use. There is no need to download third-party applications and adjust tricky parameters; an iPhone has everything you need  right from the box, and delivers an extremely personalized experience of usage.\n\nAddressing more objective advantages, one should mention updates. No matter which iPhone model you use, your device will receive iOS updates on time, right after it is released. In the case of Android devices, the situation is different; Android is an OS for a large number of devices manufactured by varying companies: HTC, Samsung, Lenovo, Acer, LG, and so on. Each company has a separate schedule of updating their devices; moreover, almost every model has its own schedule as well. So, even when Android receives an update, months may pass before your specific device gets updated—except for Google Pixel and Google Pixel 2 produced by Google itself; in this case, you will receive updates instantly (Tom’s Guide). In practice, this means that if you own, say, an older Samsung model, you will have to wait: 1) for Google to release a new update 2) for Samsung to start updating its devices 3) wait for your specific phone model to receive an update—if it ever happens at all. This is not to mention the fact that new Android releases may be poorly optimized for older models; of course, iOS 11 might run not as smoothly on iPhone 5s as on iPhone X, but it will still be comfortable to use.\n\nWhen buying a device on iOS, you will never have to deal with pre-installed carrier-bound applications you will never need. Many phones running on Android suffer from this problem: in addition to standard Google applications, manufacturers often install a bunch of their own apps that a user cannot delete from the phone (Gotta Be Mobile). If you are not a perfectionist, or do not mind your phone’s memory being occupied with useless software, then this is not a problem. However, considering that many of these applications function worse than standard Google applications, occupy extra space and RAM, and are in fact being imposed on, such a practice might be a serious disadvantage. This is not to mention the fact that due to Android’s open source code, many phone manufacturers can redesign it, creating their own versions of the software shell. This may lead to poorer optimization and user experience; when switching from Samsung to Meizu, for example, you will have to get used to the new OS look, icons, design, and so on. In case of iOS, there is no such issue.\n\nSince we are examining mobile devices, security is an important aspect that should be considered before purchasing a gadget. iOS is more secure than Android; it has much less malware developed for it, and is more difficult to break into and steal data from due to its “closed” structure: Apple developers fervently protect code, so there is little-to-no opportunity for third-party developers to make changes in it. iOS is not some kind of fortress, though—as any digital product, it has weaknesses, it can be hacked, and so on—but still, the fact is that Android may be more dangerous to use. According to the Pulse Secure‘s Mobile Threat Report published in 2015, Android can “boast of” approximately 97 percent of all mobile malware being developed for it; at the same time, in 2013, the United States Department of Homeland Security stated that the amount of malware threats to iOS was only around one percent—just because Android is an easier target for malignant developers, and because this OS has more users. Considering the aforementioned complications with Android updates, not all of the users can upgrade to the new, safer versions of Android, which means they become more vulnerable to hackers and malware (MacWorld). In this regard, iOS looks like a more reasonable option.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the pros and cons of implementing a test that citizens must pass in order to vote?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In western democratic societies, people have gotten used to almost absolute freedom: of speech, consciousness, self-expression, gender roles, and so on. Freedom of political will is among the benefits American and European societies enjoy as well; no one can be forced to vote this or that way, and even though during elections politicians fall over themselves to convince the electorate to vote in their favor, there are no guns pressed to voters’ heads: a person is free to vote any way he or she likes, or to not vote at all. At the same time, voting is not just a right: it is also a great responsibility of every member of a society, because each vote contributes to the results of elections, which in their turn will define the way society will have to live until the next election.\n\nAnd this is probably the greatest catch: since in modern democratic societies a right to vote is granted to any citizen having reached a certain biological age, the political future of each particular society depends on a large mass of random people. In other words, not only knowledgeable, intelligent, conscious, and competent people with reasonable political positions can vote—and this is a problem. Why? Let us figure out why.\n\nL.Z. Granderson, a senior writer for ESPN magazine and a CNN columnist, puts it radically, but fairly: “If I were to ask you to ingest an unknown medicine from someone who knew nothing about the medical field, you probably wouldn’t do it. And I doubt many of us would feel comfortable as a shareholder in a company that asked people who knew nothing about business to hire its next CEO? Yet we all know people who gleefully admit they know nothing about politics, don’t have time to find out what the current issues are or even know how the government works, but go out and vote” (CNN). He suggests that people who know little to none about politics, how governments and economies work, and how political solutions affect societies—in other words, people ignorant about politics—should not be allowed to vote.\n\nIt might sound shocking at first, but people have got so used to their rights and freedoms that even the slightest limitation looks like totalitarianism to them. But, for example, how many Americans unsatisfied with Donald Trump’s rule are there? How quickly has his rating dropped since the moment he was elected a president of the United States? This data can be gathered on the Internet easily, so there is no point in discussing it here; what is important, however, is how Trump became president, and what was his target audience. Attentive observers must have noticed how primitive and naive his speeches were, how easily he blamed everyone, promised to build those infamous walls against migrants, and “Make America great again.” Probably knowing that complicated problems do not have simple solutions, Trump and his electoral team still chose such a form of informing society about their political agenda that would appeal to the majority of their electoral base: uneducated or ignorant people who got used to blaming others for their own misfortunes. If his electoral base was not so ignorant and craving for quick solutions, it would question their candidate more, and would probably find out that there was no solid basis behind his loud words; as a result, America might have had a different president now, and the whole political course of the country could have been different.\n\nIgnorant and poorly-educated people always make the majority of the population. Ancient Greeks knew that; nowadays praised for inventing the democratic form of rule, Greeks had numerous limitations for those who wanted to participate in the political life of their society. Many of them would be unreasonable to implement today: to tell a long story short, a right to vote belonged only to free male citizens of Ancient Greece’s cities (Inside Loyola), and some Greek city-states also required voters to match additional criteria, such as education or a certain level of income. This way, Greeks filtered those social categories who were biased towards certain subjects; for example, poor people would obviously vote for candidates who promised to make them rich, ignorant and uneducated people would vote for those who promised them unearthly goods and happiness, and so on. By granting the right to vote to few, Greeks ensured that those few were educated, knew about the current problems of the city-state they lived in, understood how the system worked, and were interested in the best possible outcomes for everyone could vote.\n\nSo why not, for example, implement similar limitations nowadays? For example, a test—not the one that would completely remove certain groups of society from voting, but the one that would ensure voters know what and why they will be doing during the elections. The right to vote would still belong to everyone—but a person would first need to prove that he or she knows (at least in bare outlines) how the American political system works, how the economy works, why and how things in the country work or do not work. Failure would not mean being banned from voting for life, but would require a person to learn more about the country he or she lived in, and then try to take the test again. And again, and again, until this person is competent enough to decide the future of the society and country he or she lives in. Besides, it would be fair: immigrants, for example, need to pass a similar test when moving to the U.S.—so how are the rest of the Americans privileged to not know how their system works? Currently, there are many advocates of the idea to implement testing before voting in the United States, for example Jonah Goldberg, a syndicated columnist and editor-at-large of the National Review Online, the conservative columnist Ann Coulter, and the former U.S. Representative Tom Tancredo (ThoughtCo). If what they suggest works out one day, the United States’ society could be sure that its life depends on educated, well-informed people, not on marginals demanding quick solutions to complicated problems.\n\nThe idea of making citizens pass a special test to ensure their ability to make informed decisions during elections might seem limiting and somewhat authoritarian. Many people have got so used to their rights and freedoms that the idea of even the slightest limitation makes them scared. However, there are reasons to believe that qualification tests could not damage, but heal and improve the political system of the United States, because such tests would ensure that, metaphorically speaking, little children will not put forks into electrical sockets—meaning that ignorant people who have no idea about how the United States’ society works will not be able to affect its life through voting during its elections.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the positive effects of medical marijuana?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Drug addiction is something societies all over the world rarely tolerate. Although almost every culture has a tradition of consuming narcotic substances—alcohol, in the first turn—not all of them are seen as acceptable. A person saying, “A glass of beer after a long working day is my small weakness, you know” looks normal; but an almost similar phrase, “A shot of heroin after a long working day is my small weakness, you know” will sound suspicious, to say the least, will it not?\n\nDouble standards or not, narcotics are a taboo—and still there are several kinds of drugs that societies turn a blind eye to: tobacco, the aforementioned alcohol, and marijuana. The latter is illegal in many countries, but people’s attitude to it is rather benevolent—more than to any other drug. Besides, there have been talks (for a long while) that marijuana is not only a relaxing, but also a recreational drug, and that in some cases, it can be used for medicinal purposes. The Internet is full of controversial studies, either claiming that marijuana is bliss and should be legalized everywhere, or stating directly the opposite. And although total legalization might not be the best choice, there are reasons to believe that in medicine this drug can be used rather effectively.\n\nTo start with, marijuana is not totally illegal: a number of states in the USA (Colorado, California, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, and 16 other states), as well as several countries such as Netherlands have made it legal to smoke weed. This was not done on the basis of pure fun and carelessness, of course: the distribution of legalized drugs is easier to control, they are taxed, and their chemical compound can be standardized to minimize health risks and side effects. At the same time, numerous studies prove that marijuana—in its medical form—can be beneficial for patients suffering from serious diseases, such as cancer. To be more precise, there are several groups of diseases with symptoms that can be alleviated by marijuana:\n\n1) In case of various inflammations, marijuana is great for treating chronic pain. Unlike opiates, which are better when there is a need to quickly alleviate acute pain, weed is safer and more effective in decreasing long-term pain.\n2) The symptoms of arthritis and other autoimmune diseases can be reduced or even eliminated with the help of marijuana as well.\n3) Patients with such neurological disorders as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries would appreciate weed for its painkilling effect, and its ability to reduce muscle spasticity caused by damaged nerves. There have been studies about the beneficial effects of medical marijuana in patients with epilepsy.\n4) Patients with cancer having to undergo numerous chemotherapy sessions often suffer from severe nausea after them; marijuana can not only eliminate this nausea, but also prevent the spreading of some forms of cancer.\n5) HIV\/AIDS patients often experience significant loss of weight and appetite—both due to neurological factors and multiple antibiotics taken; marijuana can increase appetite and alleviate neurological symptoms (Learn.Genetics).\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by an authoritative website about medicine, WebMD, American doctors of 12 different specializations approved the usage of marijuana in medicinal purposes. During the course of the survey, more than 1,500 doctors from 48 states responded that they would advocate the legalization of medical marijuana to make it an option for patients who need it. In addition, the American Epilepsy Foundation appealed to the Drug Enforcement Administration to relax its restrictions on marijuana in order to conduct more proper studies on it. Michael W. Smith, MD, WebMD Chief Medical Editor, says that “The medical community is clearly saying they support using marijuana as a potential treatment option for any number of medical problems. In fact, many doctors already prescribe it. But health professionals are still unclear as to what the long-term effects may be. The findings would indicate a strong desire to have the DEA ease the restrictions on research so that additional studies can be done to conclusively show where medical marijuana can help and where it might not” (WebMD).\n\nYet another positive effect that might come out of the legalization of medical marijuana is the decrease of opiate consumption and prescriptions. The problem with opioid painkillers is that they can cause addiction, and although they are extremely effective in alleviating pain, there has been cases of death due to overdose. The usage of marijuana as a painkiller could fix this situation—at least partially; according to one NIDA-funded study, there is a connection between medical marijuana legalization and the decrease of deaths caused by opioid overdose, opioid prescribing, self-reports of opioid misuse, and treatment admissions for opioid addiction, as well as the reduction of doses of prescribed opioids (NIDA). Although additional studies on this subject are still required, it can be seen that medical marijuana can be a healthier alternative to traditional opioid painkillers.\n\nDrug consumption is always connected to the risk of developing an addiction. Even such “harmless” and legalized drugs as alcohol and tobacco annually cause millions of deaths worldwide. However, in the case of marijuana, there might be exceptions—given that it is prescribed for medicinal purposes, and under the control of a doctor. This drug can ease pain, help seriously ill people alleviate or eliminate their symptoms, and can even become an alternative to traditional opiate painkillers. Therefore, under certain conditions and regulations, marijuana can be used as a recreational drug.###"}
{"prompt":"How can we ensure that future generations benefit from technological advances?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" With a plethora of scientific and technological developments such as sustainable energy, interstellar mining operations, in vitro (laboratory grown) meat, synthetic biology (from genetic modification to artificial wombs), 3D printing, and extensions such as the chemputer, we are steadily advancing towards a different kind of world. Towards a world in which energy, food, medicine, and resource conflicts could become redundant—a world with no need for the dichotomies of rich and poor, haves and have nots, a world with few limits and Ferraris for all.\n\nMany would see these utopian imaginings as a naive idealism, a mere quixotic fantasy, or even a negative, dystopian drive for ‘progress’, but it seems clear that where once these developments were plain fantasy, we are now facing the prospect of a world without need, a world in which suffering can become a thing of the past and some stronger semblance of equality can be easily realised. We can help forge a world in which the current paradigm of capitalism, based on individualism and conspicuous consumption, can fall by the wayside without necessitating a reduction in our living standards or a restriction on our freedoms, be it through authoritarian government or sheer redistribution; these radical technologies can engender unprecedented changes and fantastic realities for the future.\n\nYet defenders of privilege and conservative fear-mongers will no doubt remain; these thoughts of utopia, free of want, and a realisation of equality are by no means new. Technological developments have been quick to enliven the minds of idealists throughout the ages. Economists at the beginning of Europe’s industrial revolution dreamt of and foresaw the end of want and desire, yet the goal posts consistently changed whilst Malthusian fears remained, continuing to do so to this day as the rich and powerful further their expectations, desires, and demands. Early 20th century economists such as Thorstein Veblen helped to develop the Technocratic movement, a utopian dream not dissimilar to Plato’s Republic, the theorising of an egalitarian system of abundance based on constant technological advances, alongside stable socio-political positions, enabling the provision of leisure, education, and equality for those nations with adequate natural resources. Veblen dreamt of four-hour working days with a focus on the pursuit of education, sport, and design; a fulfillment of Enlightenment ideals, yet greed got the better of us and equality is increasingly a state of reverie.\n\nOf course alarm bells may justly ring at the thought of this technocratic fantasy; devoid of democracy, with the risk of sidelining humanity in a ceaseless pursuit of progress. Yet at least in theory these dreams offer much appeal against the unrestrained and immoral capitalism which sees the rich get richer whilst the poor stagnate as we offer lip service to the virtues of egalitarianism.\n\nAlthough powerful and dominant groups will always seek to stifle the revolutionary potentials of new technologies, as they have in the past, these impending developments look set to see the democratisation of production. Specifically with technologies such as the 3D printer, as resources are gathered from the stars or created ex nihilo (out of nothing), we must question our desires and expectations of the future in earnest. As we have seen from the technological revolutions within the music industry through peer-to-peer sharing applications such as Napster or BitTorrent, 3D printers will only exacerbate issues around intellectual copyright and the sharing of information, attempts at protectionism are already fighting a losing battle against an internet that cannot be reined in by futile laws and restrictions. Intellectual copyrights, protection, and internet regulation will increasingly become the fundamental battlegrounds for an equitable society whereby mine and future generation’s openness to sharing will struggle against corporate interests and the established hierarchy.\n\nWe need to ask ourselves what kind of world we want to leave for future generations and what values we are content to raise our children with. For a start, we must move away from insidious individualism and thoughts of personal protectionism. Whilst there is no doubt that these are issues for the future, we must begin shifting the paradigm in order to prepare the ground for the changes that will be seen, if not in our lifetimes, but in our children’s. Already we are struggling to reframe the narrative from one of constant employment with lengthy and oppressive working lives to one of employment for all, an end to retirement, shared workloads and a stronger emphasis on leisure, community work, sport, and education.\n\nAs the developments outlined earlier move towards reality, we must ensure that we do not repeat the failings of the industrial revolution, that we ensure a lifetime of education to the highest standard for all, not simply those who can afford it. Genuine equality must not be viewed as supererogation as these technologies and scientific pursuits are making its actualisation possible. It is therefore up to us to ensure that entire future generations are encouraged to live meaningful lives, and to do so we need to look beyond capitalism.\n\n————\n\nWritten under a Creative Commons License, with edits: https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/1.0\/###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages and disadvantages of freelancing?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Since the time freelancing became an option, wide discussions about what is better—full-time jobs or freelancing—have continued. The advocates of working full time believe that it is a more stable and secure source of income. Indeed, an employee working in an office has a guaranteed monthly salary, all kinds of bonuses, paid vacations and sick days, and a number of other social benefits; a freelancer is a self-employed person, so it is always his or her problem and responsibility whether he or she wants to take a break, gets sick, or lacks income. Skipping a work day as a freelancer often means not getting paid, whereas an office worker—even the least meticulous one—receives money regardless of the amount of work done. However, even though freelancers make a somewhat socially and financially vulnerable category of hired workers, there are many reasons making people aim for shifting from office routine to freelancing despite the risks. Why? Because freelancing possesses a number of benefits many full-time workers can only dream of.\n\nThe first and foremost benefit of freelancing is a flexible working schedule and conditions. What does a regular office worker do? He or she gets up close to 7 a.m. and rushes through half the city through bad weather, traffic jams, and crowds of people to spend eight hours in a cubicle, and then go back home. Ways to leave earlier (for example, when an employee’s little daughter is having a concert or play at school, and wants her parents to be present) are little to none. On the other hand, a freelancer does not have to go to work every day: his or her home is the workplace in the majority of cases; or, in other words, a freelancer’s workplace is wherever a wifi spot and his or her laptop is. This is a great way to achieve the notorious “work-family” balance: being able to work and at the same time stay close to one’s family members is priceless. Besides, a freelancer often does not have a specific work schedule; rather often, there is a deadline, prior to which a task must be accomplished, and no other time restrictions. Flexible working hours make it even easier to not only earn money, but to be able to pay attention to other matters as well: going into sports, for example, playing with children, taking care of elderly family members, or relaxing. Of course, it does not mean that working as a freelancer is easy—it may be a fun job, but it is still a job, with its own catches, complications, and stresses—but it gives an individual more of personal freedom than a regular full-time occupation (LifeHacks).\n\nConnected to this is the second argument in favor of freelancing: in many companies in the western world, the classic “nine to five” scheme is becoming obsolete—and it is not that companies allow workers to work less time. On the contrary, there is a tendency for workers to overstay in their offices, trying to deal with the ever-increasing flow of daily tasks. Even when an office worker is at home or on vacation, he or she continues being bombarded with work emails, phone calls, and notifications—and, in fact, office workers are expected to be available. Even though they are being disturbed outside workplace, not replying to such calls may negatively affect an employee’s career or reputation. A freelancer, on the other hand, is his or her own manager, having to accomplish only the work he or she has applied to. Freelancing may be an even better option if you are a woman willing to dedicate your time to raising your children, but without abandoning your career; men will find this option useful as well. Generally speaking, if you like having your day structured, or do not have anything against working outside the work hours, an office job is for you; if you are, however, engaged in other activities besides work, freelancing might be a better choice for you (EnvatoTuts+). This is not to mention the eternal problem of being underpaid; there are many specialists who are doing great as professionals, but due to various circumstances, do not earn as much as they deserve. As a freelancer, you will most likely be spared of this problem: you always get what you work for.\n\nAnd yes, the ability to work and travel more is yet another advantage of becoming a freelancer. How many of you, when being on vacation overseas, have met relaxed people with a laptop on their knees, and wondered, “How does this hippie make a living?” The answer is that these people are probably freelancers. The ability to take off from one’s mundane place of living and travel to a completely new environment without having to worry about the sources of income, days off, or other corporate ties is perhaps the brightest and most valuable possibility in a freelancer’s lifestyle (Bloggerz Arena). Of course, there are a number of nuances freelancers have to consider while travelling: different time zones, for example, or the costs of living (since many professionals do not make much money when starting to work as freelancers), and so on—but what are these difficulties compared to the possibility to be as free as a bird?\n\nBeing a corporate employee has its own advantages, and it would be wrong to say that full-time work is somehow inferior to freelancing. Office workers get a stable income, enjoy social benefits such as paid vacations and sick days, and are, in general, more protected than freelancers. However, freelancing can offer a number of benefits that could make office work seem dull. For example, a freelancer can afford combining their work with travelling—anywhere, anytime, and for as long as one wishes. Freelancing is also a more comfortable way to work because of the ability to choose working environments, instead of having to go to the same office year by year. And this is not to mention that freelancing allows to effectively establish and maintain the “work-family” balance! Freelancing might not be for everyone—but perhaps everyone should try freelancing at least once in their life.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some examples of absolute truth?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Can absolute truth exist? First, let us look at a Wikipedia (a place for consensus) definition of it for all those that want it defined: “Absolute truth is something that is true at all times and in all places. It is something that is always true no matter what the circumstances. It is a fact that cannot be changed” (Wikipedia). The modern world, in the majority, believes in relativism, but there are some reasons why we should consider absolute truth as a viable proposition.\n\nThere are constants in the Universe we live in. Gravity, for instance, affects us all the time on Earth no matter if we believe in it or not (Backman, John). Even if one does not know the word “gravity” and its properties, it is acting with or without our knowledge of it. Say a person who has never came in contact with the modern world and lived in the jungles of the Amazon for his or her entire life, gravity would still affect him or her with or without knowing the science behind it or its nomenclature. And also, even if scientists do not completely understand gravity (though to a great extent they do), it is constantly barraging us and all that exists on Earth.\n\nAnother absolute that we can agree on is that the reality each of us is perceiving is happening. Even if you believe individual reality is an illusion, or a computer program, or anything else, you are perceiving a form of existence. You are reading this paper right now on an electronic device, or having it read out loud to you. There has never been a case where a baby was born without all five senses. This means all living creatures sense the world around them in some way. Also, there has never been a recorded living being that lost all of its senses. This means that no matter what, we are perceiving existence.\n\nAnother way to look at absolute truth is through semantics. When people claim that “absolute truth does not exist,” either this statement has to be absolutely true or not. Also, if someone claims “we cannot know anything for certain,” it is only in regard to “our” knowledge, and we cannot be certain that other beings more advanced than us can know absolute truth. Lastly, if someone claims that “all truth is empirically or scientifically testable,” it is intriguing that this statement itself cannot be empirically or scientifically tested (Strange Notions).\n\nAbsolute truth is not as elusive as one might think. It is in the form of constants like gravity, in the everyday life of our perception, and in the search for meaning. Though most ideas, especially moral ones, are relative, there are absolute truths that cannot be refuted no matter if we believe in them or not, or if we know about them or not.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the most important argument against banning private schools?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Kevin Rooney wants to start a fight to ban private schools (1)(2). To give every child an Eton. To storm the Bastilles of private education and appropriate them in the name of social justice. To abolish them, and then invade them. Rooney seems to have a real love-hate relationship with private education. Arguing that all children ‘are born with the potential to achieve great things’ he wants to remove the inequalities of personal wealth that gives only one child in many the educational opportunities they all deserve. While I support the idea that a society can and should strive to provide a truly excellent Eton-standard education for all, I draw back at the idea of banning private schools in particular and, more broadly, at the view that inequalities of wealth are the real problem we face today: especially with respect to education.\n\nFirstly, I should put my cards on the table and say that I was privately educated in secondary school. Thanks to the sacrifice of a single mother working for a charity, I got to learn Latin and Greek at school—and go to Oxford to study classics. Supporting an inspiring slogan like ‘Etons for all’, however, should not be couched in terms of arguing for ‘equality of opportunity’ for children with respect to education. Right now, this can have no substance other than effectively calling on the state to intervene to override, to alleviate, to apologise for, the normal operation of the market. At a time when the tendency of the state is towards increasing intervention into our basic freedoms, attacking the limitations of the market may not be as progressive as it sounds.\n\nWhen Rooney argues for putting ‘higher quality of education for the wealthy’ on the table, this can only play out one way: removing it from the wealthy. Which is to deny the right of some people to set up a business (or in many cases a charity) that charges a fee for services—in this case, a high quality education. It means denying other adults the right to spend their money on such services. It is not clear why they should lose the freedom to spend and consume as they see fit. Because they are being selfish? Failing in civic responsibility, is the state to take them over its knee? In the name of ‘equality’, the right to exchange goods freely in the marketplace—the fundamental bedrock of equality in a capitalist society—is to be abolished. So why stop there? Private music teachers? Go whistle. Private language tutors? Au revoir. Private health-care? Join the waiting list.\n\nThis is the equality politics of ‘that’s not fair’. In a society so anti-consumption, so accepting of the limits to growth, the cry of why cannot I have what he has—aspirational on the face of it—is no sooner uttered than it turns into the envious whine of if ‘I cannot have it, then neither will he.’ This is—beneath the stirring rhetoric—a tacit acceptance of our society’s failure to provide excellent universal education for all. It does not speak to raising up the level of education to the best examples we have on offer. It does not offer us all more Etons. In fact, it serves to undermine our equality before the law.\n\nYou do not have to believe that private schools are right and good to be opposed to calls for the state to ban them. That is, to dismantle private institutions and remove their freedom to choose which pupils to take. This is to attack fundamental freedoms (of association, or not to associate) which are based on the ability to discriminate: we will only take children who are Catholic or Muslim; or wealthy; or good at rugby; or, indeed, on their merit. These are all legitimate criteria for a private institution. It is that ability to discriminate that makes private schools independent in a powerful sense. One of the good things about private schools is their independence from more than minimal state interference. They are normally free of Ofsted inspections, for example, one of the most destructive elements of contemporary education. They do not have to follow the national curriculum. They are free to educate as they see fit, they are free to exclude pupils as they see fit, they are free to reject worthless qualifications as they see fit. They are judged on their results by the market and trust me that—whatever the limitations and they are many—of the market, they are as nothing compared to those of Ofsted. The market at least reflects in some sense our social relations, and has more humanity in it than the mentality of government box-ticking.\n\nWe should also be aware that banning private schools would tie in nicely into a lot of policy circle initiatives gaining influence at the moment. When James Purnell MP, director of the Open Left Project, says that ‘Labour has sometimes been too hands off with the market and too hands on with the state’, he is seeking to intervene against market outcomes that he does not like, yes, but he is also giving up on the ability of the market to deliver higher incomes and prosperity for us all—in the context of a complete absence of any alternative to the market. In this context, that means: Labour has poured resources into state education and the only reason it can think of that they are not delivering the results is because some 7% of rich kids are so distorting the playing field that they deserve to be handicapped for a change.\n\nAs independent institutions, private schools, much like the Catholic Church, are a grave source of concern for those who monitor and graph inequality. They appear as dinosaur bastions, unacceptably elitist throwbacks, who stubbornly insist on old-fashioned teaching instead of child-centered learning. They are seen as exclusive, discriminatory, hierarchical, and old-fashioned. Such language is used to present attacks on independent institutions in the name of the excluded ‘victims’ of their unacceptable prejudice. But we are not made victims by not going to public school. Nor would the Chinese and Indian students who increasingly attend them be better off were they denied entry. Rather, the continued existence of independent schools teaching an elite education is precisely what gives rise to Rooney’s desire to have Etons for all. To ban them would be to remove that possibility, that thing to aspire to, that itch to get in and raise yourself up to the level of those elites.\n\nI would have more sympathy with the argument if it were turned on its head. Let us make state schools more independent. Fund them by all means, do stop them from discriminating on entrance, but let the state be hands off. Increase the numbers of teachers. Introduce a high-minded liberal knowledge-centred curriculum. Invade and abolish Ofsted. That would seem more in the right direction than what can only be in reality a cynical effort to paper over real differences in wealth and privilege in our society with the language of ‘equality of opportunity’.\n\nEquality of opportunity is not the same thing as equality of condition—having the same level of access to resources—and neither does it target privilege. Rather, it seeks to locate social problems in the socially-excluded who are then given ‘opportunities’ to help themselves. This is what Labour now refers to as “active equality”: giving people “power to shape the outcomes they seek”. That those outcomes may represent inequalities is then justified as a reward for their talent. Thereby entrenching inequalities. Focusing in on the talent and potential of every child is both discriminatory against the privileged children and secondly narrows the definition of equality down to just being a reward for talent.\n\nThere is a more important argument to be had about education today than trying to reignite a class war against the toffs. The report of the Sutton Trust stating that the children of the poorest families fall behind a full year by the time they are five may not be as sensationalist as the claims of Iain Duncan Smith that the brain sizes of deprived nursery children are “three times smaller than they should be”. Both, however, represent the same set of assumptions so prevalent at the moment, which holds that deprived children are almost irretrievably damaged long before they reach primary school. It is, the implication is, the fault of their parents for not sufficiently aping middle-class behaviour. Not that they are financially deprived so much as they are emotionally deprived: their families are apparently short on cocoa, cuddles, and very hungry caterpillars at bedtime. Being working class these days seems more of a qualitative than a quantitative failing.\n\nThis is the ground on which we should fight for a better education system. Reject out of hand the idea that parents, or teachers, are failing their children. Argue that we are capable of improving education through building a better system with more resources for all. Reject the idea that quantitative improvements matter less than the tender ministrations of state therapists or behaviour management neuro-psychology gurus. Do not accept the limitations of the way things are now and seek to lessen the impact—that is to shut off the possibility of dreaming great dreams. Game changing goes out the window in favour of making the present more bearable.\n\nThere is an argument for not settling for what we have. Letting our dissatisfaction look for ways to create the genuinely and radically new. And that would mean really aspiring to a great education for all.###"}
{"prompt":"How can sports bring people together?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sports, for thousands of years, have been a wonderful means for humankind to exercise one of our most basic instincts: competition with our fellow humans. Surrounding all types of sports is the idea of sportsmanship, the respect and ethical behavior shown to all participants of a contest. Sports fans around the world have all seen their share of sore losers, bad winners, and generally horrifying displays of poor sportsmanship. Yet, in all sports, there remain certain dogmas that only the most poorly-behaved sportsman would dare to violate. The spirit of the game, in many cases, is far more important than the outcome of the match, and a true competitor understands this. This is why many of our most beloved athletes are not always the most talented or outstanding performers—those who play with the purest heart, for the sake of the team, and with respect for all opponents. Truly transcendent athletes are those that are able to combine this intangible trait with world class skill.\n\nThere are greater lessons to be learned from this besides being well-liked in the sporting community. Sports, and by extension, the athletes who play them, are able to go beyond cultural differences; surely there are stylistic differences between countries and regions, but in general, sports are played the same wherever you go. Similarly, all fans of a sport are able to appreciate incredible athletic feats or truly classy displays of sportsmanship. Simply put, sports have a way of bringing people together. In a day in age when settling cultural differences is of utmost importance, turning more towards sports is a reasonably viable way to bring the world closer together.\n\nThe best example of a sport bringing two societies together today is the case of cricket contests between India and Pakistan. Tension and hostility have marked the relationship between the two countries for much of the last century. What has become known as cricket diplomacy has been able to bring an air of friendliness to talks between leaders. In 2011, the former president of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf was quoted on the benefits of cricket diplomacy. He said, “Firstly, I think it can be used as an ice-breaker in case the two opposing groups’ leadership is not in touch with each other. Secondly when they meet, it improves the environment of discussion because they have a better understanding of each other because I have personally believed that inter-state relations have much to do with inter-personal relations.” Although he went on to say that he does not believe that cricket diplomacy will lead to resolution, it is clear that is eases the initial tension that can be a major detriment to diplomatic proceedings.\n\nFrom my own personal experience as an American currently living in London, I have had the opportunity to speak to both Indian and Pakistani students studying here. The response I receive when I bring up cricket is remarkable. The passion and love they have for the game is unmistakeable, and, as is often the case when someone speaks passionately, I have been an eager listener. They want to share the game with me. Then comes the dreadful moment when I am asked “Why isn’t cricket played in the US?” It is the world’s second most popular sport, yet it is virtually nonexistent in one of the world’s largest and most capable countries. Naturally, I do not have a good answer; to me, it just is not popular. Further embracing and becoming familiar with sports that are not played at home can really help in overcoming a cultural divide, even if it is just to get the conversation going.\n\nThere are countless other examples of the way sports can overcome cultural boundaries. Kobe Bryant, of the NBA’s Los Angeles Lakers, is immensely popular in China—one city has built a statue of him. Ichiro Suzuki, a Japanese baseball player, has easily been one of the most popular player’s in the MLB during his time in the US, despite rarely giving an interview in English. It has been said that he “speaks baseball”—that is, he plays the game the right way, one which any true fan will appreciate.\n\nSimilarly, a recent trend of European footballers, such as David Beckham and Thierry Henry, coming to the US has helped quell the notion that Americans do not play or watch football, although the country still has a long way to go. Lastly, international events such as the Olympic Games or World Cup are perfect opportunities to show the world that international cooperation and peace are possible, if only for a few short weeks every couple of years. Sports can and need to be used as instruments of change, proponents of peace, and in general, positive and unifying forces in an ever uncertain world.\n\nThe Olympic Creed says it best: “The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph, but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered, but to have fought well.”\n\n———-\n\nThis is provided under a Creative Commons License, with a few edits: https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/1.0\/###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of surrogacy?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In the 21st century, technology has helped us broaden the traditional boundaries we typically put around the notion of family. One of the latest trends in reproduction is surrogacy, where a couple (or single person) who, for whatever reason, cannot have children, hire a woman who can to carry their offspring. Often, the childless couple is a wealthy, western one that, driven by high prices and heavy restrictions in their home country, opts to travel to developing countries, where the costs are lower and the legal environment more welcoming. For this reason, this type of surrogacy is known as ‘outsourced pregnancy’ or ‘fertility tourism,’ and it is a booming industry. In India especially, clinics have popped up all over the country and many impoverished women, knowing the pay they receive will be enough to totally change their circumstances, are all too happy to sign up to be surrogates.\n\nThough there are certainly moral questions that have rightly been raised, the global surrogacy industry should be recognized for the overwhelmingly positive impact it has had on people all over the world. Not only does it bring the miracle of life; it injects much-needed cash into impoverished areas. Nevertheless, there are many who are opposed—westerners especially. They make the comparison between this benign industry, where all involved participate freely, and Margaret Atwood’s Handmaid’s Tale, a dystopian reimagining of a society in which a women and their reproductive capabilities are controlled outright by men (Warner 2008). The comparison is a terrible one, one which completely misunderstands what is really going on. Rather than oppressing women, surrogacy gives women opportunities they can choose to act on or not, and those who oppose it would rob participants of their right to self-determination.\n\nDissenters argue that surrogates in developing countries, many of whom are uneducated, cannot give their informed consent because they cannot understand what is really expected of them (Williams 2013). This argument is pure condescension. Just because a person is uneducated does not mean they are incapable of rational thought. Most surrogacy clinics in India require that surrogates have already had multiple children of their own, ensuring they will be fully aware of the physical and emotional toll pregnancy will take. Furthermore, many surrogate mothers are anxious to be surrogates two or three times, suggesting that the experience can be as beneficial to surrogates as it is to the people who commission the child.\n\nAnother point of contention is the health risks involved in surrogacy. To be sure, this is one area that needs to be studied further, and potential surrogates need to be informed of the risks they are taking before they get involved. As far as we know now, though, the health risks are fairly low, and manageable; surrogates face only slightly greater risks than an average woman would normally face during pregnancy (Surrogacy in Canada Online 2017). Some surrogates react negatively to the fertility drugs used to increase the chances of successful fertilization, and in rare instances, severe ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome can occur. In general, however, surrogate mothers receive excellent healthcare, as it is in the clinic’s best interest to ensure the health of their surrogates.\n\nThere are, of course, instances where a woman’s health is negatively impacted by surrogacy, but these are the exception, not the rule. We should remember that there are health risks associated with many kinds of occupations, such as with mechanics or construction workers, but we do not argue that cars should not be fixed or homes not built because of the risk to the workers. Firemen and construction workers are adults who know the dangers and are capable of making their own decisions, as are surrogate mothers. The emphasis needs to be on ensuring that women are properly informed and taken care of, rather than condemning surrogacy altogether.\n\nThe most commonly-used argument against fertility tourism, however, is that it is exploitative: it takes advantage of poverty-stricken women and pays them far less than a surrogate would usually be paid in a developed country, which is true. Though estimates vary, surrogacy in the West can cost tens of thousands of dollars more than in India, where, depending on which clinic you choose, the total fees could be as little as $12,000. Of this, the surrogate will usually receive around $6,000. The difference is how much that $6,000 is worth. In India, that is enough to buy a house, or start a business, or send one’s children to school. It can make an incredible impact on a woman’s life, breaking the cycle of poverty for her and her family.\n\nMoreover, attempting to discredit surrogacy because of the money involved is simply unrealistic. By this line of reasoning, anyone who does anything for pay is being exploited. There are various unpleasant aspects to pregnancy, and human beings rarely do unpleasant things without being rewarded. Obviously few women would agree to be surrogates if they were not being paid, but payment does not delegitimate the practice.\n\nWhat this all really comes down to is an inability to comprehend why surrogates behave in ways that contradict traditional ideas of motherhood and womanhood in general. In “Oh Baby Baby: The Problem of Surrogacy,” for instance, Matthew Tieu argues that there are certain unbreakable bonds that naturally develop between a mother and the unborn child she carries during pregnancy. Surrogate mothers, says Tieu, will inevitably face great psychological trauma when forced to give up the baby. Those who do not are simply repressing their true, deeply-seated feelings. This suggests that all women possess the same maternal instincts (and emotions they have no control over), and those that do not are unnatural, or somehow emotionally incomplete. In reality, there is little empirical evidence to prove that there is really a ‘special tie’ between birth mother and fetus, and even if there is, most clinics counsel surrogates to prepare them to give up the baby. They are not damaged, but they are not unnatural either.\n\nBefore I conclude, I would like to make one last point that I realize people are not homogeneous, and their motives and experiences with surrogacy will of course vary. Not all people who seek surrogates do so because they are infertile; some might be motivated by a fear of pregnancy, or something else. Likewise, surely not all surrogates volunteer to be so out of an altruistic desire to provide for their families; it is entirely possible that they may simply want to buy a shiny new car. Whatever the motivation or rationalization, though, it just does not matter. Adult men and women have a right to make their own decisions and do what they want with their bodies, and until their actions do harm to another person, their moral status is not our business.\n\nAll of this is not to say that those who oppose surrogacy are entirely wrong to be wary of the practice. For centuries, the weight of the world has been pressed down upon female bodies and their reproductive organs, and we should certainly be suspicious of anything that seems as though it may be taking advantage of women. But when we look closer at surrogacy and abandon our preconceived ideas of motherhood, we can see that it should be seen as a source of empowerment, not oppression, for women. Far from a come-to-life Handmaid’s Tale, surrogacy is a business where the providers, clients, and many of the entrepreneurs who run the industry are all women. As technology continues to revolutionize reproduction, we should not only accept but welcome the new opportunities that redefine motherhood and the family, and give us the power to control nature.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of postgraduate education?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" For many young people, college is mostly a way to get the education they need for further professional activity. Some students study eagerly, others drudge through it, but all of them understand that without graduating from a college or university, future perspectives are dim. Anyways, many students after completing higher education and getting employed in a company or starting their own business tend to think that attending an educational institution was the last time they had to study. What such people do not realize is that studying is, in fact, one of the biggest services one can do for oneself.\n\nA certain set of skills obtained during the years in a college or university implies that a person continues working in the same field for years. This person may become highly proficient in their area of work, and may change companies he or she works in or climb the career ladder—and there is nothing wrong with that. However, if this person feels fed up with what they are doing, and would want to realize themselves in a completely new field, there is a drawback: a minimal amount of education obtained during one’s student years might not be suitable for this. For example, a person who studied journalism and worked as a journalist in a news agency feels that he or she cannot continue working there anymore; what he or she wants now is to become a designer. There are two options for such a person: either to keep dreaming about the desired job while continuing to work in a position he or she hates—because of the fear or unwillingness to start studying again, or because they think it would take too much effort—or to look for a design school and learn whatever is needed to become a designer and finally change their job. This is not an easy decision: changing one’s profession, lifestyle, and duties is by all means challenging—but studying can make this process go smoother (FSW).\n\nIf a person has no problems with their profession, it does not mean that postgraduate studying is not necessary. Any profession has, so to say, a basic level, and an advanced one. A basic level implies that a worker knows his or her duties, knows how to perform his or her functions in order to manage daily workloads, and is satisfied with the state of things. The advanced level implies that there is always something new to learn even within a profession a person thinks he or she already knows; that there are a lot of nuances, keeping an eye on which can not only improve the quality of one’s work, but help a worker get promoted, become a company’s valuable asset, develop business, and so on. And getting to this advanced level requires a person to study; nowadays, many companies offer their workers all kinds of workshops, seminars, conferences, and other events during which it is possible to develop new skills, obtain new knowledge, meet important people, and contribute to one’s own development in a number of other ways. Participating in such events can be a great benefit to a worker who wants to learn and grow professionally. Needless to say, companies value such workers, so this kind of studying can be a great way to enhance one’s career (IFR).\n\nBesides, continuing to study even after graduation can make a person more diverse, versatile, better adapted to different life situations, and able to manage all kinds of complications. This is not to mention that being intellectually active is good for mental health. For example, in the case of such a dreaded problem as Alzheimer’s disease, studies show that people who have it and who continue engaging in all kinds of intellectual activities developed the symptoms of this disease much later than those who did not study. “If two people had the same amount of Alzheimer’s pathology, and one had higher education and engaged in more cognitively stimulating activities, and one had lower educational attainment and didn’t participate in as many mentally stimulating activities, then the symptoms [of Alzheimer’s] would appear earlier in the person with less cognitively stimulating activity” says Dr. David Knopman, professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine (Time).\n\nPostgraduate education is not only a great way to boost one’s career, but also a ticket to a new life of possibilities: if a person wants to change his or her lifestyle or profession (and they are often connected to each other), there is no better way than obtaining a set of completely new skills and fresh knowledge. Besides, mental activity can positively affect one’s mental health, and even in such difficult cases as Alzheimer’s disease, studying and using one’s cognitive functions actively can significantly decrease the pace of the disease’s development. Therefore, graduating from a college or university is not a reason to stop learning.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of volunteering abroad?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Among the most-valued experiences in the first quarter of the 21st century is travelling. The amount of foreign countries visited is a sort of indicator, showing a person’s open-mindedness, readiness for change, mobility, and curiosity. Although travelling across the globe is not cheap, there are ways to make it not just less expensive, but also combine it with useful activities; one of such ways is volunteering. One can become a volunteer in their native country, but it is volunteering abroad that has become the most favored way of helping people around the world—and there are a number of solid reasons for this.\n\nThe most obvious one is career opportunities. Becoming a volunteer is something that by definition does not involve receiving a salary, so for some people this might be a stopper; “What, waste my time on a job that does not pay off? No way.” This is what these people are likely to think. However, the truth is that volunteering can in fact boost one’s career, not slow it down; it helps a person become a more diverse and innovative personality, acquire a range of unique skills, and in general create a positive impression when doing job hunting upon return. Research conducted in 2015 showed that recruiters tend to prefer a candidate’s volunteering experience over personal presentation skills, literacy, or even other work-related skills. According to another study by the British Council, the experience of working or volunteering abroad benefit both those who look for a job, and their potential employers (gvi.co.uk). This is due to the fact that volunteering is, in fact, a cheaper and more effective way to obtain valuable skills: instead of attending classes, a person learns and immediately applies new knowledge “in the field.” These skills can vary in a wide range: giving presentations for an organization, fundraising, event planning, completing specific projects, and so on (Cheat Sheet). So, although on the surface volunteering may look like “working for free,” in fact it is a great investment in one’s future career.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of living and working in China?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Every day, China is becoming more and more influential in terms of the global economy, politics, and authority. The times when China was an underdeveloped country passed long ago, and nowadays this Asian giant is a recognized and respected opponent (and\/or partner) of other powerful countries such as the United States and Russia. Although not all of the regions of China are as remarkably prosperous as its coastal areas, China has recently become incredibly attractive for millions of people around the world to live and work in—and for a number of reasons.\n\nChina has a rapidly growing economy, with many companies now becoming world leaders or at least major competitors to already existing ones—for example, Meizu, Xiaomi, AliExpress, and many others. This means two things: firstly, China has a giant labor market, with the amount of workplaces growing every day. For a person both inside or outside China, this is a great opportunity to find his or her dream job. Secondly, as a person from abroad looking for an internship or a job in China, you have higher chances to be hired compared to applying to the same position in your home country; this occurs due to your foreign expertise and the knowledge of English (or another foreign language), which can theoretically help a Chinese company be a more efficient competitor. This is also the factor that can bring you a quicker promotion—so, why miss the opportunity? Working in China is a great experience, and a huge bonus to your CV in case you decide to work elsewhere after your Chinese experience (Tripbase.com).\n\nIf you move to China, you will discover another reason why this country is worth moving to: its prices. For Chinese people, the costs of different products may be high, but if you are a citizen of the United States, European Union, or any other country with a high quality of life, you will find Chinese prices pleasantly low—the cost of living in China is affordable, even if you are an intern on a student budget (GoAbroad.com). See for yourself: public transport is cheap even in Beijing, the capital of China—only $0.32 to get to any corner of the city by subway; taxis are cheap as well. As for the local food, it is not only cheap, but also delicious, so you will find yourself regularly dining in all kinds of street cafes, stands, and so on. A portion of Beijing duck will cost you about $10, and a barbecue on a stick will be only $0.30 (China Highlights). Considering that Chinese cuisine is as filling as it is tasty, such prices are more than affordable.\n\nIn addition, living and working in China can be a life-changing experience. As a westerner, you will see more or less similar things, get into similar situations, or meet alike people while you travel around the Western Hemisphere. However, arriving to China changes everything. First of all, Chinese people see foreigners as an exotic phenomenon, so you will feel like you are at the center of public attention. If you ever wanted to know how celebrities feel, this is your chance (China Whisper). The differences between your mentality and the Chinese mentality can be frustrating sometimes, but when you learn to adjust to discrepancies, you will open your mind and truly love the industrious and unusual people of China. You will visit exotic places, find yourself in a number of challenging situations, and learn to live in an alien culture—what can be more enriching in terms of experience?\n\nChina is one of the most rapidly-developing countries in the world. Its culture is different from the western one, but it is also the number one reason to move to this beautiful country. As a western person, you will find it beneficial not just in terms of your career (which is not difficult to build there), but also in terms of the cost of living—the prices are more than affordable—and the limitless new experiences you will gain on a daily basis.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the evidence for global warming?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In the past 1,300 years, Earth has not experienced such a warming trend as we are having now (NASA, 2016). In fact, the World Meteorological Organisation has stated that the global temperature is 1.2C above pre-industrial levels and for three years in a row, it has been the hottest year on record (Carrington, 2016). Though the scientific evidence seems overwhelming in favor of global warming, there are those, for various reasons, who believe that global warming is a hoax or not empirically verified. This is disappointing, as the future of our planet is at stake, and the last thing we should do in this critical time is argue whether or not our world is being destroyed. In order to enlighten those who believe global warming is not currently happening, I will present evidence that will show that global warming is real due to sea levels rising, global temperatures rising, warming oceans, shrinking ice sheets, declining Arctic sea ice, glacial retreat, extreme temperature events, ocean acidification, and decreased snow cover. In turn, I will also discuss counterarguments and their refutations.\n\nThe world over, sea levels are rising at an unprecedented rate. Two reasons why sea levels are rising is because of the warming of sea water (water expands when it warms) and the melting of land-based ice, such as glaciers and ice sheets. According to scientists John Church and Neil White, the global sea level rose 17 centimeters (6.7 inches) in the last century. Furthermore, the rate in this last decade has been nearly double compared to the last century (Church & White, 2006). So, if we compare the sea levels from this century to the last, it is obvious that sea levels are taking an unexpected turn—and the global rise in temperature has much to do with this.\n\nA global rise in temperature has been obvious for some years now. T.C. Peterson et.al., in their analysis for the Special Supplement to the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, found most of the warming happened in the past 35 years, with 15 of the 16 warmest years on record occurring from 2001. In addition, 2015 was the first time the global average temperatures were 1 degree Celsius or more above the 1880-1899 average  (T.C. Peterson et.al, 2016). This clearly demonstrates that global warming is a recent phenomenon, and should be considered especially dangerous if it continues at its current rate.\n\nLike sea levels rising from warming, the oceans are also shown to be warming. According to geophysical research by Levitus, et. al., the oceans have absorbed the increasing global heat, with the topmost 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of oceans demonstrating a warming of 0.302 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969 (Levitus, et. al., 2009). Even on the surface of oceans, something that is easy to record scientifically, global warming is more than noticeable.\n\nAnother happening that is also easy to detect is the shrinking of ice sheets. Specifically, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are decreasing in mass at an accelerated rate. Information from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment point to Greenland, which lost 150 to 250 cubic kilometers (36 to 60 cubic miles) of ice per year between 2002 and 2006, and to Antarctica, which lost about 152 cubic kilometers (36 cubic miles) of ice between 2002 and 2005 (NASA, 2016). This is not normal by any means, and shows there is an uncertain future for animals that inhabit those ice sheets and for us as a species, as higher ocean water levels means certain masses of land will be covered by water.\n\nAlong with ice sheets, Arctic sea ice is declining rapidly. The National Ice & Snow Data Center show that the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has dissipated quickly over the past several decades (National Snow and Ice Data Center, 2016).  This is a telltale sign that global warming is at work.\n\nGlaciers are also being attacked by global warming, like other frozen bodies of water. The National Ice & Snow Data Center presents evidence that glaciers are retreating globally. This includes areas such as the Alps, the Himalayas, the Andes, the Rockies, Alaska, and Africa  (National Snow and Ice Data Center, 2016). It is not a rarity or a strange, local phenomenon: it is a global catastrophe that needs to be addressed.\n\nExtreme events come hand in hand with catastrophes. According to the National Centers for Environmental Information, the amount of record-high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the amount of record-low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. In addition, the U.S. has seen increasing amounts of intense rainfall events (Gleason, 2016). There is no doubt we still have cold winters, but the extreme high temperatures we continue to experience worldwide are becoming more and more harsh, which can kill more people and ravish crop lands.\n\nAnother dangerous result of global warming that is present is ocean acidification. The PMEL Carbon Group states that since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has grown by approximately 30 percent (PMEL Carbon Group, 2016). To put this conundrum into greater perspective, C. L Sabine, in his article, “The Oceanic Sink for Anthropogenic CO2,” noted that the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans is growing by near to 2 billion tons per year (Sabine, 2004). This leaves coral reefs and many other species living in the oceans vulnerable to adverse effects and points to our own demise as a species in the near future.\n\nNow let us rise to the mountains from the oceans. Spring snow, that beautiful sight we have while driving through the mountains, is in danger. Gleaned from the research done by the National Snow and Ice Data Center, we get to know that satellite observations demonstrate that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades. In addition, the snow is melting earlier than usual (National Snow and Ice Data Center, 2016). Not only does this mean less of a chance to do winter sports, but it also endangers the habitats that these mountains maintain.\n\nDespite all these factors involved and the evidence shown from highly-credible sources (mostly governmental), there are critics of global warming as a scientific fact. One such criticism is that there is no real consensus that it is real, and that it is something up for discussion. However, the fact is that according to the authors of seven major climate consensus studies, about 97% of climate scientists believe in global warming (Skeptical Science, 2016). The critics who try to debase these results point to minor studies funded by far-right politicians and lobbyists.\n\nAnother significant criticism of global warming as a true phenomenon is that what is happening now is a part of Earth’s geophysical processes. Every 1500 years, approximately, the heat distribution of Earth switches between hemispheres, though total heat globally remains the same. However, this is a much different happening than human-produced global warming, which has been created by emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere within the last 200 years. Unlike natural heat variations, the present temperature increase made by CO2 is being recorded globally—on the ground, in the air, and in the oceans (Skeptical Science, 2016). So, it is not a natural heat distribution issue that happens precisely at the same time (the 1500-year hemisphere seesaw), but rather an issue of global heat increase that has been happening since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThough this was only a glimpse at the mountains of evidence pointing to the fact of global warming, it is difficult to dismiss. From frozen bodies of water melting more rapidly, to water levels rising and having more acidity, to global temperatures rising to increasingly-common events of extreme heat, global warming is showing its signs in a variety ways. However, there are those that are against global warming as a fact, citing counter arguments, though most of them are illogical when faced with the growing mounds of empirical evidence that demonstrate global warming as a real phenomenon and the strong consensus in favor of it being a fact within the scientific community. And if you still do not believe in global warming after reading this essay and after seeing the data proving it, you have to admit that emitting CO2 in the atmosphere cannot be healthy for Earth in the long run, and that we should do whatever we can to change the way we treat our planet and ultimately ourselves.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of traveling to Southeast Asia?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are places on our planet that tourists around the world have been favoring for decades. Hawaii, India, Southern Europe—these are examples of popular destinations, gathering millions of foreign visitors annually. Of course, this is so for certain reasons. Unfortunately, the majority of popular tourist places possess a number of inconveniences that can greatly spoil the impression and experience of visiting them. Prices (incredibly high prices, to be exact) are probably the biggest inconvenience: naturally, the more tourists that arrive to a certain place, the higher local vendors will raise their prices. This is not to mention annoying crowds of foreign people with cameras everywhere, disappearing authenticity (Hawaiian parties, for example, have turned into an attraction for pensioners long ago), and the impossibility to enjoy a new country by yourself.\n\nAt the same time, there are many options tourists usually either ignore or underestimate. Earth is a big place, and a lot of exciting things are waiting to be discovered—you only need to change your perspective a bit, and consider travelling scenarios you previously did not pay attention to. One of such options is Southeast Asia, the land of undiscovered wonders.\n\nOf course, some countries of Southeast Asia are rather popular, especially Thailand and Philippines. Alas, they are mostly known as sex capitals of the world, so many people go there primarily for sex; this is even though the cultural, historical, cuisine, and other experiences these countries can offer to a tourist are much more rewarding and impressive than what Bangkok red lights districts can provide. Considering this, this essay will focus on conventional tourism, so to say.\n\nSo, what makes Southeast Asia a tourism option you should consider?\n\nThe first reason is the prices all across the region: they are ridiculously low. One of the first problems a backpacker needs to solve after arriving in a new country is accommodation. In Southeast Asia—almost everywhere—accommodation is so cheap that for the money a tourist would spend on a hostel in Europe for one week, in this region, he or she could live one month! See for yourself: if you go to Cambodia or Laos, a place in a dorm room would cost you somewhere between $2-5 per day. A night in a Vietnamese hostel will cost you $8-10. Thailand is probably the most expensive on the list, with prices between $6-13. If you are not fond of living with a bunch of unfamiliar people, get ready to pay only $15-20 for a private room. Of course, these prices depend on cities—larger cities and popular tourist destinations will naturally be more expensive, but generally, throughout the entire Southeast Asia, you can find extremely cheap accommodation easily, especially considering there is no need to book a hostel in advance: basically, you show up and rent a room\/bed in the spot (NomadicMatt). So, if you are a tourist with a limited budget, worrying about a place to stay for a couple of weeks, Southeast Asia is your choice: staying there is more than affordable.\n\nBy the way, the same refers to food. Almost everywhere around Southeast Asia you will be able to find quality street food for low prices. The price for a pack of chewing gum in the United States equals a huge portion of filling, exotic food in Vietnam.\n\nAs well as “mainland” Asia, the region possesses ancient history and deep culture closely interconnected with Buddhism. The ruins of Angkor Wat, Javans, Champa, pagodas of Bagan, millenary temples, and shrines—all this and much more awaits a tourist discovering this part of Asia. Relics of the past are so numerous that even if you spend a year in the region, you will probably not be able to see all of them. Along with the ancient times, Southeast Asia has gone through intense political and military turmoils during the recent century. The war in Vietnam, the terror of the Khmer Rouge, the destruction of Laos, Pacific navy battles, Japanese invasions—this is just a tiny part of what was going on here not so long ago. Knowing about the hardships Southeast Asia had gone through, and witnessing its rapid development now, watching incredible contrasts intertwine and combine, it is difficult to not fall in love with this place. Besides, if you are seeking for cultural diversity, Southeast Asia has it all: with such a diversity of languages, customs, ethnicities, religious beliefs, lifestyles, and fashions concentrated on such a relatively small piece of land, your immersion in the atmosphere of this place will be instant, deep, and impressive (Bootsnall.com).\n\nYet another good argument for a budget tourist visiting Southeast Asia is the convenience and affordability of transportation in the region. Naturally, when you arrive in a new country, you do not want to spend your whole time in one city—you want to see all of what this country can offer, and this often implies using public transport, such as trains or buses. Well, booking transportation in Southeast Asia is easier and cheaper than in many other regions of the world; every big city is flooded with travel agencies offering their services for almost no cost, and even getting to some distant islands is not a problem (Goatsontheroad.com). A bus is usually the cheapest way to travel around the region: a 5-6 hours ride by a bus will cost you only $5-8. Overnight buses are somewhat more costly—10-15 dollars, depending on distance. As for the transportation within big cities, there is only good news for a poor tourist. For example, a bus around Bangkok costs only 10 cents, and the subway, $1. The local train system of Singapore starts its pricing from $1 as well. Taxis and minibuses are usually more expensive, but it is possible to bargain with the drivers, so you can get a price up to two times lower than the one initially suggested by a cab owner. (Nomadicmatt.com). All of which means, in a nutshell, that you will be able to see everything you want, get everywhere, and spend a reasonable amount of money.\n\nSoutheast Asia is a unique region with ancient history, rich culture, incredible food, and unique experiences a traveler can get from visiting it. With incredibly low accommodation prices, affordable food, and convenient transportation, this part of Asia is the number one choice for a budget tourist. Therefore, when planning your next trip, you should definitely consider going there.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of space colonization for humanity?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Impetuous and sometimes uncontrollable progress in all spheres of science, the growth of population around the world, ecological problems, wars, and many other crises modern humanity faces nowadays raises a question about whether Earth will remain capable of being home for us as a species in the nearest future. There are measures taken to soften, slow down, or even negate the effects human civilization causes to our planet, but some of the problems seem to be unsolvable.\n\nOne of them is population growth. People can discover new energy sources, learn how to grow food from nothing, or invent thousands of new appliances to improve the efficiency of everything, but it is not a fully effective way to stop the global population from growing. For a long time, the solution was to expand the territory on which this population is living. However, it is not enough; measures such as constructing artificial islands, terraforming, or innings, are relatively effective, but unfortunately they cannot impact the situation with overpopulation on a global scale. Besides, some of these solutions affect the environment in destructive ways.\n\nThere is, however, yet another way to deal with overpopulation: an ambitious and daring project, which, in case of its success, can start a new era in humanity’s history: exploring and colonizing distant planets. Space colonization is a controversial, debated, and expensive method, but it is probably the best we have for now, for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst of all, there is always a danger of a cataclysm that humanity will not be able to predict or defend itself against. Every year, the media publishes messages about “killer asteroids” approaching Earth, but all of them have been missing our planet so far. One day, humanity could be less lucky; be it an asteroid, technological catastrophe, or some kind of ultra-intensive sun flare, one day there could be something we will not be prepared for—like it happened to the dinosaurs more than 60 million years ago. “The dinosaurs died out because they were too stupid to build an adequate spacefaring civilization. So far, the difference between us and them is barely measurable,” says Tihamer Toth-Fejel, a research engineer at the Advanced Information Systems division of defense contractor General Dynamics (Popular Science). Since it is impossible to be prepared for everything, setting off from our planet and travelling to other planets seems to be a more efficient option in terms of preserving human culture, gene pools, and civilization in general from total eradication, in case something goes terribly wrong. As the saying goes, it is better to not keep all eggs in one basket.\n\nAnother reason might seem a bit far-fetched, but it is neither less strong, nor less significant to human civilization. Leaving Earth and colonizing new planets and star systems will probably become the greatest achievement of our species. The Universe is not just huge, it is fact endless, at least in relation to that tiny piece of space humanity occupies in it; as such, it would be naive to assume there were or are no other sentient civilizations we could one day come in contact with. And even if we do not, would not it be great or even sublime to leave a trace in the history of the Universe, even if we, as a species, will disappear? So that when some alien archaeologists would visit a distant planet somewhere on the outskirts of the Andromeda galaxy, they would find the remains of our architecture, art, technology, history? So that those alien scientists of the future would study us as we study the ancient civilizations of Babylon or Greece, and would admire our achievements, the great expanse of our genius? I know it sounds probably too solemn and proud, but is it not what the purpose of a civilization is: to leave a legacy? Would it be better to reach the population of 100 billion people in the next two centuries and choke on our own toxic emissions, crowdedness, fight for free space, and starve to death? Because this is what awaits humanity if it does not venture to space.\n\nThis (meaning a drastic finale for human civilization) is confirmed by several influential scientists, Stephen Hawking, in particular. “Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet Earth but to spread out into space. We have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years. But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years, our future is in space,” Hawking says (Tree Hugger).\n\nIn addition, colonizing other planets would solve not only the problem with overpopulation, but would also create additional working places, establish brand new economical systems, such as space tourism, and finally solve the ever-existing problem of natural resources. There are numerous opponents of this motive for colonization, mostly among “green” citizens. “Why do we need to move to other planets to excavate even more resources? Why do we need to exhaust other planets beyond our own?” they ask. Because, first of all, colonizing other planets would prevent us from sucking Earth dry and completely destroying it. Because, secondly, too many people in a tiny space (and Earth is already becoming tiny in terms of available living space) will inevitably lead to conflicts over whatever becomes precious in the following years: oil, free space, clean water and air, and so on. And thirdly, because there is no guarantee that a civilization that is advanced enough to fly around space will, by that time, treat ecology the same way it does now.\n\nColonizing space is perhaps the only “win-win” solution humanity can come up with in order to solve the problem of overpopulation. It would not only insure our civilization from oblivion in case of any kind of global catastrophe (be it total war or giant asteroids), but would also solve the problem with natural resources, create working places, stimulate the economy, and contribute to the overall scientific, cultural, and industrial progress of humankind. And, which is the most important, it will help humanity leave a trace in the history of the Universe; instead of remaining and probably disappearing as a small local civilization on the outskirts of the Milky Way, it will become a galactic phenomena, leaving its relics all over the explored space, a legacy for future generations. Whatever happens to humanity, this would be its grand finale.###"}
{"prompt":"How can anger be effectively used to establish and defend personal boundaries?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" “Saint Anger”: the name of Metallica’s album released in 2003, and a rather controversial expression if used outside the context of heavy music. Indeed, when it comes to anger—feeling it, expressing it, or even talking about it—people tend to treat it as something horrible, unacceptable, and publicly decried. Anger can quickly transform into rage, and when a person is outrageous, he or she can commit horrible actions. In this relation, it seems the epithet “saint” can be applied to anger in a rather limited number of situations.\n\nHundreds of thousands of parents (if not millions) around the world teach their children to suppress or ignore their anger. Intentionally or not, they show their children that feeling angry is wrong, that it is better to always look calm and balanced, and even if there is a thunderstorm of rage boiling in a person’s chest, and that this person should not, under any circumstances, show his or her true emotions. But is it possible to tame a thunderstorm?\n\nAlong with this, anger—or, to be exact, the ability to feel, express, and use it constructively—plays an extremely important role in a person’s emotional health. Anger can and probably should be used for self-defense from physical and emotional violence; it is useful for bearing obstacles, achieving goals, and self-realization; anger can show a person what is wrong in their life situation, and give him or her strength to fix it. It performs many functions, so it is crucial to realize why it is important to feel anger.\n\nFirst of all, anger can be effectively used to establish and defend your personal boundaries, personal space, sense of justice, beliefs, and so on. When another person somehow infringes upon your comfort, one of the first emotions you normally experience is anger—along with the urge to fix an unpleasant situation, cast away the violator, or do something else to defend yourself. Anger provokes you to ask yourself a question, “What has happened? Were my boundaries\/freedom\/beliefs violated? What can I do to fix it?” In other words, anger returns you to yourself, to your security and personal needs. And the great thing about anger is that it is not only a catalyst, but also a high-octane fuel. When a person is angry, he or she sweeps away any obstacles in their way without rumination. It is important to keep your anger under control: express it in socially-acceptable ways if your life is not under threat, mind not to hurt other people, and so on. But generally, anger demonstrates your readiness to confront threat, and gives you strength to do so (Lifehack). Therefore, when used with care, it is your best weapon for emergencies.\n\nAnger can serve to cloak some other emotions of yours if they are less appropriate. Everyone knows the classic “flight or fight” response to danger. It does not mean you are feeling either scared or aggressive towards a threat; rather often, it means you are both afraid and aggressive. Sometimes, expressing fear is unacceptable—for instance, among men in more traditional cultures, where masculinity and valor is highly valued; so, covering fear with anger, acting aggressively remains a more appropriate option for men, even in more “gender-neutral” western countries. And this is an effective strategy: not just in terms of saving one’s reputation within a certain social group, but once again, in terms of dealing with difficulties and bearing obstacles.\n\nAnger is an extremely powerful emotion—as compared before, alike to a thunderstorm—and it is not recommended, if not dangerous, to suppress or ignore it. A person who has been covering and hiding their anger cannot get rid of it—the anger will still build up inside, finally resulting in unnecessary and\/or excessive violence as a response to a situation that does not require it (Foreign Policy News). If a person suppresses his or her anger, it can still manifest itself in a number of dysfunctional behaviors, such as substance abuse, vandalism, and so on.\n\nTherefore, it is important to learn how to manage anger, express it non-violently and in a non-offensive manner, redirect it in constructive directions, and use it as “fuel” for one’s actions that require persistence and large amount of efforts. Anger signalizes that your inner boundaries are being violated, and stimulates you to act accordingly; it can help you temporarily deal with other emotions that are less effective or appropriate in a certain situation; and anyways, if you do not express it, sooner or later it will manifest itself in a form of rage, dysfunctional behaviors, or in other harmful ways. So, do not ignore your anger: face it, accept it, and learn how to deal with it.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages of e-cigarettes over regular cigarettes?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Smoking tobacco is probably one of the worst habits humankind has developed. Originating as a tradition of the Native Americans, practiced mostly on special occasions, smoking has gradually become a kind of mass addiction. Due to the efforts of tobacco companies seeking to increase their sales, people started smoking more and more often; the evolution of a more traditional pipe to a cigarette took some time, but eventually tobacco became more affordable and easier to use (you now simply need to light it up, instead of having to always carry a tobacco pouch, stuff a pipe, puff it, and so on). As a result, deaths and health issues connected to tobacco consumption became a worldwide concern.\n\nA popular belief is that it is nicotine that kills. It is only partially true: although nicotine does harm one’s health (mostly affecting the cardiovascular system), it is the tar, carbon monoxide, hard particles contained in cigarette smoke, and a bunch of toxic emissions and heavy metals that deal the most damage. Nicotine causes addiction, and the smoke does the rest.\n\nNowadays, there are alternatives to analogue tobacco smoking: the widely popular electronic cigarettes. Although it is hotly debated whether e-cigarettes are harmful to smokers’ health or not, it is hard to argue that substituting cigarettes with these devices does more good than bad, since they possess a number of advantages that cannot be neglected easily. And whereas smoking still remains a dangerous and unacceptable addiction, e-cigarettes might be a decent way to break free of it.\n\nElectronic cigarettes deliver nicotine to a smoker not through burning (which obviously implies inhaling harmful and toxic smoke), but through the evaporation of nicotine-containing liquids. An e-cigarette heats up the liquid in a special container called an atomizer; the liquid evaporates, and through this vapor a smoker receives their dose of nicotine. Thus, the process of nicotine consumption in this case should be called “vaping,” not “smoking.” These liquids usually comprise glycerol, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, propanediol, and some other components (NCBI). Although some of them are not completely harmless, the chemical composure of e-cigarette liquids is definitely safer than the one of a regular cigarette. However, thorough control over the composure of these liquids should be established, and the usage of such components as ethylene glycol and propanediol should probably be banned. Still, if a smoker does not plan to quit, he or she might want to consider using e-cigarettes instead of real tobacco.\n\nAnother good reason for a smoker to start using e-cigarettes is that the aforementioned liquids can contain different amounts of nicotine. A heavy smoker might want to start vaping using liquids containing up to 24 milligrams of nicotine, and the good news for them is that it is possible to gradually decrease the dose until zero milligrams are present.\n\nAlthough some smokers might experience physical symptoms when trying to quit smoking tobacco, in the majority of cases, it is a strong psychological component that does not let a smoker give up their addiction. It can be assumed that there are five main components of this psychological addiction: 1) believing in the relaxing\/stimulating effect of nicotine that helps a smoker deal with stressful situations; 2) a smoker’s need to “keep hands busy” when bored, waiting for something, feeling nervous, and so on; 3) socializing with “fellow smokers”; 4) unconsciously and “automatically” following the habit; 5) the fear that if a smoker quits, he or she will lose something valuable, a source of psychological support or pleasure. In addition, some smokers find it aesthetic to inhale\/exhale smoke, or have other reasons to continue tobacco consumption. Generally speaking, smoking is a behavioral pattern consisting of repeating situations and reactions. Without neglecting or challenging these reasons, it can be said that an e-cigarette is probably a safer alternative for a person who does not want to give up nicotine. They still deliver nicotine to a smoker’s body (thus fulfilling the reasons 1 and 5); they disrupt automatic smoking described in points 2 and 4 (since e-cigarettes function differently from their traditional analogues); they allow a person to continue socializing with other smokers during breaks at work, or on other occasions, as mentioned in point 3. But, while performing the same functions as regular cigarettes, electronic devices are safer and more socially acceptable.\n\nIn addition, a purely aesthetic reason to prefer e-cigarettes over their analogues: when evaporated, the liquids taste and smell better than tobacco.  They are sold in a variety of flavors: melons, apples, cherry, tropical fruit, mint, blueberry, and so on. At the same time, regular tobacco smells and tastes awful not only for the non-smokers, but for a smoking person as well. So, why not stop poisoning oneself with toxic smoke, and at least substitute it with pleasantly smelling vapor?\n\nNicotine addiction in any of its forms, regardless of whether it is smoking or vaping, is a huge problem for addicts. It leads to a number of severe, chronic diseases and even to death. At the same time, there might be a healthier alternative for those smokers who realize the harm they cause to themselves, but who cannot yet give up their addiction. Electronic cigarettes are nowadays considered to be safer than regular cigarettes. Liquids used in these e-cigarettes contain fewer toxic elements, and do not include the products that are commonly burned in cigarettes. Vapor from e-cigarettes is mostly harmless to non-smokers; it tastes and smells better, which makes smoking e-cigarettes a less reproached habit. Finally, many smokers might discover that e-cigarettes do not obstruct their reasons to continue smoking, while making it possible to decrease the amounts of consumed nicotine and to eventually break the habit. Therefore, without praising or advertising e-cigarettes, it can still be stated that they are a more preferable alternative for smokers.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the main components of the success of 'Breaking Bad'?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When you ask people about their hobbies, many of them say something like, “I enjoy reading books and listening to music,” or “I like to watch movies.” Watching movies—or, rather, TV shows—has indeed become an extremely popular activity, especially in countries where there is access to Netflix or other similar services. This popularity is easy to explain: TV shows often offer products much more diverse, intriguing, and non-standard than conventional films. Shows such as “True Detective,” “Game of Thrones,” “House M.D.” and many others have proved that such a format is definitely not inferior to movies; on the contrary, it can be superior to them at times. And, perhaps, the best example of the show that beats many films in all respects is “Breaking Bad.” Many critics claim it to be the best TV show ever; without making such radical statements, let us take a look at the factors making this media product such a massively popular phenomena.\n\n“Breaking Bad” can boast of a perfectly-created atmosphere of decadence, criminality, and that omnipresent shady part of the everyday most of us never notice or pretend does not exist. The dark world of drug dealers, cartel wars, addiction, and illegal commerce is definitely not appealing, or romantic, or attractive, but in “Breaking Bad” it is realistic and convincing, and makes you believe you are peeking through a keyhole at a dangerous and cruel world.\n\nThe dense atmosphere is masterfully complemented by camera work. When watching the first episodes of season one, I was amazed by the composition of scenes, the choice of shooting points and foreshortening, colors, foreground and background work, and the different elements in the frame.\n\nThe storyline is another huge advantage of “Breaking Bad.” A story of a regular chemistry teacher, whose measured and not-so-happy life was in one day ruined by the news that he has incurable cancer somewhat reminds me of the movie “Knocking on Heaven’s Door,” but in a much darker execution. Being a chemist, Walter White believes (or this is how I understood it) that a human being is nothing but a composition of molecules, with all the respective consequences: no heaven, no hell, no afterlife retribution, no real value of human life. Nothing to lose too; the title of the show hints at what is going on in Walter’s head after he learns about his diagnosis and the understanding that his life is going to end soon, and that he has always lived in a way he did not want to. What comes out of it is told in five seasons, and this story is dramatic and engaging.\n\nYet another component of “Breaking Bad” is its characters. Perhaps you are already fed up with one-sided, cliched vanilla heroes, or deranged, evil masterminds that Hollywood inserts in almost every movie it produces. Such characters have no depth, no inner conflict, no credibility; they, as well as their actions, basically serve as triggers to move the plot forward, and allows movie directors to demonstrate new stunts and effects. “Breaking Bad” is different; each character is a personality, with his or her own motives, problems, thoughts bugging them, life situations demanding their response, and so on. Each of these characters, even if he or she is secondary and appears only for a couple of episodes, is thoroughly exposed, so the show makes you believe he or she is real. Moreover, each character is complex, meaning that good and evil intentions, desires, motives, and thoughts constantly intertwine and interact within them, defining their behaviors—like all of us.\n\nAnd, of course, violence and total intolerance, so to say. There is probably no other show that would depict our everyday reality with such cruelty, and with so few “soothing” filters. This is a breath of fresh air for many viewers, tired of endless glossy movies, perfectly appropriate in terms of political correctness, and cautious in their depictions of violence. “Breaking Bad” is honest, gruesome, and ruthless—like real criminal life.\n\nSo, what makes “Breaking Bad” one of the best shows of the 21st century? In my opinion, there are several main components of its success: a dense atmosphere of criminal decadence combined with fine camera work; an intricate and dramatic storyline involving a number of extremely well-researched and credible characters; and, of course, uncensored violence—physical, emotional, and psychological—that this show is soaked with.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of staying in a hostel for travelers?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Throughout the recent decade or two, travelling has become extremely trendy. In a world where billions of people are bound to their cubicle workplaces, a possibility to buy an airplane ticket and fly to a different country is relieving. If you make a small effort, you will easily remember the titles of dozens of books united by the same plot: a man\/woman works hard, breaks down, goes to India\/Nepal\/Africa, finds his\/her true self, and returns back home enlightened; this stereotype illustrates the significance travelling has gained over the recent years.\n\nTravelling is fun and useful for the psyche. However, even if you are about to change your whole life, throw away the ties that bind, and be reborn, you will still have to solve a bunch of mundane tasks for your journey, the first of them is finding a place to sleep at night. Many travelers choose to stay in hotels (mostly those of an older age), while younger people prefer hostels and Hospitality Club options. And, by all means, a hostel is the best choice for a traveler. Regardless of your age or gender, if you are setting out to a new country with an intention to start a new life, a hostel is the place you need to stay at. Why?\n\nBecause a hostel is a place where cultures clash. It is like a hub, where people from all over the world meet, get to know each other, and make friends. During your first two days in a hostel, you can meet more new people than you did throughout your whole last year of office work. People in hostels are usually friendly and relaxed, often ready to share their stories, food, and experience with you, and expecting the same from you. Usually, on the third day in a hostel, you already start hanging out with a couple of interesting people. If you are more of an introverted type of personality, you might dislike dormitory rooms, but you will spend about 90% of your time out of a hostel anyways, so this should not be a big problem.\n\nPrices are another huge advantage of any hostel. Even those located right in the center of a city still offer democratic and more than reasonable prices for their services: beds, laundry, shower and bathroom, wifi, kitchen, security (the majority of hostels are equipped with video cameras), travelling assistance, and so on. In fact, a hostel is a dormitory, so it does not provide as exquisite services as hotels usually do, and you have to share your personal space with other people. This is probably why a night in a hostel will cost you on average two-three times cheaper than if you would stay in a hotel.\n\nAnother benefit of staying in hostels comes from the fact that they are always full of people, including locals—not to mention the staff, who are almost always local people. Local people usually know the city just like their five fingers, and can provide you with invaluable tips about what you can do, what to see, what to eat, where to go, and also the best way to move around the city. They know the “features” of their hometown, so they understand what you are looking for as well, and can save you time and effort by telling you what to pay attention to in the first place.\n\nHostels are probably the best alternative for travelers seeking new experiences, not comfort. Whereas conventional hotels can provide you with exorbitant comfort and luxury (ask yourself: do you really need it?), hostels provide the basic amenities, for prices far lower than moderate. A hostel can be located right in the city center and still cost you up to three times cheaper than a room in a hotel. Hostel staff often consist of local folks who can show you around, or provide you with directions and tips. And, besides, there are many other travelers staying in hostels, so you can be sure you will make some new friends, or at least get to hear stories of other people’s lives and journeys, which is also a valuable experience. If you want to try out something new in your life, a hostel might be one of the first things to get yourself acquainted with.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the reasons why Donald Trump should not be supported during the current presidential election campaign?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Soon the United States will have a new president. After two terms of Barack Obama’s presidency, the country expects the new leader to not only bring fresh air to American domestic and foreign policy, but also to solve a number of problems that have accumulated during the past eight years. Without speculating how efficient Obama was as a president, as well as leaving aside the comparisons between the two major candidates—Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump—it still must be said that the latter is probably the worst choice for president this election season. There is a number of reasons underlying this statement.\n\nDonald Trump is, first of all, a businessman, not a politician. Perhaps this can explain the fact that he cannot boast of well thought-out policies: he has been criticized for being unable to come up with any kind of substantive policy. Probably trying to fix this, Trump proclaimed building a huge wall on the border between the United States and Mexico to be one of his major political goals. Apart from this proposal being chauvinistic, it would not only leave the problem of illegal immigration unsolved, but would also be insanely expensive and impractical in many other ways. Trump’s idea to make the Mexican government pay for this wall sounds even more spontaneous and naive (Goliath). And this is, by the way, the second reason why it is difficult to trust a candidate such as Trump: he rarely supports his rhetoric and\/or ideas with something more substantial than just words. When criticizing the Obamacare program, Trump could not suggest anything better than “something terrific.” No specific plans, no comprehensive analysis has been proposed for American society: only populist rhetoric aimed at those radically-thinking Americans who prefer to vote for slogans, not for the actual future. “Mass deportation,” as Trump suggests, will hardly solve any of America’s current problems, but will most likely increase their number (ReverbPress).\n\nAs it has been noted, many radical people support Trump for his attitude towards immigrants (in particular, against Mexicans and Muslims), and his rhetoric against them. If Trump wins the elections, it is unlikely he will be able to effectively bring his anti-immigrant plans to life. According to the American Action Forum, a right-wing institute based in Washington D.C., if the current immigration laws is modified in the way Trump proposes, it will cost the United States government up to $600 billion, and reduce the GDP by $1.6 trillion. Besides, in this case, the number of workers (many of them being immigrants) would decrease by 11 million people. This is not to mention that making such anti-immigrant policy work would take up to 20 years. Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, believes that “It will harm the U.S. economy. Immigration is an enormous source of economic vitality” (The Street). As it can be seen, supporting Trump’s ideas is not just harmful, but also anti-patriotic—so American patriots should stand against Trump’s place as president.\n\nThose people believing Trump would become an effective manager for the United States because he is a wealthy person and a businessman should consider the fact that Donald Trump inherited his wealth from his father, not fully earning it himself. His popularity and the status of celebrity seem to be earning him more money than his business acumen, and there has been numerous cases when he filed for bankruptcy. This means that he had made multiple decisions that were wrong and harmful for his business. Can a country such as the United States afford such a person being its president? It is unlikely (DiscussMuch).\n\nBesides, Donald Trump is (or at least seems to be) a rather ignorant person, being interested only in promoting himself and, to the extent defined by his political ambitions, the United States. What lies beyond its borders remains a mystery to this candidate, judging from scandalous and gullible comments he made about other nations, which is definitely unacceptable for a future president, whose competence and responsibility should stretch out to the whole world. Being a president requires knowledge and understanding of global processes, foreign relations, and diplomacy. None of these applies to Donald Trump’s candidacy (Goliath). Extrapolating this fact to Trump’s history of bankruptcies, it is not difficult to assume the mistakes he will make while occupying the Oval Office, and the horrible consequences of these mistakes.\n\nDonald Trump is surprisingly popular among Americans, which is disturbing, considering his obvious incompetence in everything related to governance, foreign relations, and economics. The scandalous proclamations and grandiose plans he makes are not supported by common sense, nor by any substantial reasons, plans, or programs. Being more a celebrity rather than an effective businessman\/manager, Trump will hardly be a good president for the United States, and thus should not be supported during the current presidential election campaign.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of volunteering?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In our modern, capitalistic world, the idea of doing something for free might sound strange. Western society has oriented itself on success and profit, people possessing honed professional skills, and being able to “sell” these skills; therefore, the idea of working for free does not fit into such an outlook. However, it strongly depends on how you look at it; for instance, volunteering, which has become popular in recent decades, is one of the greatest examples of how a job can pay off not with just money. It can be said that everyone should at least once in their lifetime try volunteering due to a number of reasons.\n\nAlthough it may sound paradoxical, volunteering is one of the easiest ways to find a job. After graduating from a college or university, many get stuck in the situation of trying to find a job, but needing working experience, you cannot obtain working experience because no one hires you. Statistics show about 73% of employers would prefer to hire a person with volunteering experience in the field than a person without one; 94% of employers share the belief that volunteering helps potential employees obtain new skills and diversifies their qualification, and thus are more prone to hiring people who volunteer. Respectively, 94% of those people believe volunteering can add to one’s skills; 94% of people who were hired after a volunteering experience say such an experience aided them in getting their first job, or benefited them in other ways, such as quicker promotion, salary increases, or obtaining new skills (World Volunteer Web). Having relevant work experience obtained during volunteering and specifying it in your CV can be a kickstarter for your career, because nowadays more and more employers tend to count volunteering as actual work experience (ReachOut.com). Besides, volunteering is a great option to explore possible career opportunities if you are unsure what you would like be doing for living. Through various programs, you can try yourself in a number of organizations, working on different problems, and in different positions, without having to do job-hunting, and then job-hopping. Therefore, if you still think you do not have time to volunteer because you need to look for a job, or because volunteering could be a nuisance to your duties, you might want to reconsider your opinion.\n\nAlso, volunteering is a natural way of socialization and getting to know your surroundings, meeting new people, and finding useful contacts. Regularly meeting with a group of people who share the same activities, way of thinking, and goals can make it easier for you to make friends. Besides, volunteering could make a great example for your children; if you want to teach them responsibility, compassion, and how one person can make a difference by personally participating in solving it, you should volunteer; children tend to learn through observing what adults do, and by your example, they will have a great role model to adopt. And, of course, through volunteering, you can find a lot of useful contacts, resources, and activities for your whole family (HelpGuide).\n\nThere have been surprising research studies connecting helping other people on a voluntary basis with mental health; specifically, people who are known to be involved into different forms of selflessly helping other people, animals, and so on, felt like they were undergoing some sort of beneficial therapy. In particular, according to CSV, millions of people in the United Kingdom doing voluntary work started to feel less depressed; about 48% of those who have been involved in volunteering during the last two years felt relief in terms of depression, and improvement of their mental condition. Among more than 600 volunteers who were observed during the experiment, 63% of people aged between 25 and 34 said that volunteering reduced their stress levels—so did about 62% of volunteers over 65 years old. According to CSV’s research, volunteering also helps reduce work-related stress, and even boosts productivity: 31% of people aged between 18 and 24 said they had taken less time off work since starting to volunteer (The Guardian).\n\nAll these facts demonstrate that volunteering is a great alternative to a number of other activities, since it can help you acquire work experience and get a job; makes you more sociable, and turns you into a good role model for your children; and besides, it decreases the levels of stress we are exposed to on a daily basis, and helps people effectively combat depression. Therefore, you might want to start volunteering as soon as possible.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of driving an electric car?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The world is changing quickly, and what looked like a science-fiction fantasy is gradually becoming our current reality. It seems that progress spreads to all spheres of humanity’s life, but one of the most amazing breakthroughs has been achieved in the energy sector recently. About two decades ago, it appeared there was no effective alternative to conventional fossil fuels such as gasoline and oil, but it turned out that there is a better, cleaner, and more effective substitute to them: electricity. Although electric engines are not so widespread, more and more people are changing their gasoline-fueled vehicles to electric cars. This choice is more than reasonable.\n\nThe maintenance cost of electric cars is lower than those fueled by conventional gasoline. Fuel prices heavily depend on the political and military situation in countries that provide oil; even if we do not take it into consideration, one year of driving a gasoline car costs you about $2,100 (given you drive about 15,000 miles per year, use one gallon of gas for each 25 miles traveled, and buy gasoline at $3.50 per gallon). At the same time, driving an electric car costs you only $475 per year. Along with the fuel costs, conventional cars require regular technical inspections, transmission repairs, and so on (EVgo). By all means, electric cars are a much cheaper alternative for those who want to save money.\n\nSafety is another reason why electric cars are more preferable. There were several incidents when Tesla Model S electric cars flared up. This motivated Tesla Motors to research the situation with car fires in general, and it turned out that there are about 150,000 car fires per year only in the United States. “Since the Model S went into production last year, there have been more than a quarter million gasoline car fires in the United States alone, resulting in over 400 deaths and approximately 1,200 serious injuries,” Tesla Motors management informs. “There are now substantially more than the 19,000 Model S vehicles on the road that were reported in our Q3 shareholder letter for an average of one fire per at least 6,333 cars, compared to the rate for gasoline vehicles of one fire per 1,350 cars” (The Long Tail Pipe). So, according to the statistics, electric cars are safer—at least in terms of flaring up.\n\nElectric cars are also known to be more efficient in terms of converting energy: on average, electric cars use about 60% of the power of the electrical energy to make the wheels spin, compared to 17%–21% of the energy stored in gasoline converted to power at the wheels. This is important not just in terms of efficiency, but also environmental protection, because the more effective use of energy means fewer resources taken from nature; besides, electric cars emit no greenhouse gases. Power plants that produce electricity may pollute the air, but only those working on fossil fuels; nuclear, hydro, solar, and wind power plants produce no pollution at all. So, the more people that choose to drive electric cars, the less damage will be dealt to the environment (fueleconomy.gov).\n\nAs can be seen, electric cars are in many ways more preferable than conventional gasoline vehicles. The costs of fueling and maintaining an electric car are much lower compared to those of regular cars; electric cars are safer in terms of being prone to flaring up—according to statistics, many more car fires occur with gasoline vehicles than with electric cars. And finally, electric cars are more environmentally-friendly, meaning that not only people but our whole planet benefits from them. Thus, as many people as possible should choose to change their vehicles to electric cars.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some reasons why Hillary Clinton should not be elected president?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hillary Rodham Clinton might become the first female President of the United States of America—formerly being the First Lady, a senator, and the Secretary of State—as she is running as a candidate in the 2016 presidential election. It is important, therefore, to determine if she is a corrupt politician and should hold office as the President of the USA. From her numerous scandals, her acceptance of campaign money from lobbyists and corporations, and her lying to the general public on a regular basis, I believe Hillary Rodham Clinton should not be elected as President of the USA.\n\nIf one types “Hillary Clinton scandals” in any search engine on the Internet, one will invariably find countless articles on her decades of scandals–even ones that are happening now, such as the FBI probe into her private email server as Secretary of State and her Clinton Foundation misdealings with finances (McLendon, Inquistr). Though Clinton is yet to be charged with a criminal offense, her countless scandals do not show her in a good light–especially when she is a lawyer and knows how to circumvent the judicial system (Calabrese, Eohistory). Some of the most famous scandals she has been involved in are: mishandling the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi in 2011; the fact that she gets paid $275,000 on average for each public speech; the Whitewater scandal, which started as a property business venture and ended up as illegal loans, tax evasion, and even a possible death; and Filegate, which arose in 1996, was an improper access to FBI files that was orchestrated by Hillary Clinton (Gobry, The Week). However, Clinton has not been charged or arrested for any of these scandals, even after decades of being faced with allegations. Yet, not being proven guilty in court is not a final indication of being innocent (especially with high-profile people with big money), such as the OJ Simpson case, where the jury fell for the defense’s tricks and did not follow the highly-detailed DNA evidence that was given (Quora).\n\nBut if these scandals are not enough to make you dissuaded in voting for her, you should pay attention to the money she takes from lobbyists and corporations to work for their special interests. Democracy Now! reports that, “According to a new report by Greenpeace, Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the super PAC supporting her have received $138,400 from fossil fuel lobbyists and $1,327,210 from bundlers, totaling more than $4.5 million from lobbyists, bundlers and large donors connected the fossil fuel industry” (Cray, Democracy Now!). This is a conflicting message that Mrs. Clinton is giving when she says she wants to work for climate change (Hillary Clinton Campaign, Hillary Clinton). In addition, she has received millions of dollars from various large corporations, with the top corporation, Soros Fund Management, giving her $7,039,900 (Open Secrets). If she is taking this much money from lobbyists and corporations, how can an American citizen trust she will work for the common person, instead of her rich and politicized donors? On the other hand, though, the Clinton Foundation, which Hillary Clinton is actively involved in, gives amply to humanity. “Because of our work, more than 31,000 American schools are providing kids with healthy food choices in an effort to eradicate childhood obesity; more than 105,000 farmers in Malawi, Rwanda, and Tanzania are benefiting from climate-smart agronomic training, higher yields, and increased market access; more than 33,500 tons of greenhouse gas emissions are being reduced annually across the United States…” (Clinton Foundation). However, this same Clinton Foundation has been accused of fraud and is currently under pressure by the US Congress to get to the bottom of their misleading with foreign nations in regard for pay-for-play enterprises (Investor’s Business Daily).\n\nIt can be said that Mrs. Clinton is a pathological liar. She lied about being under sniper fire in Bosnia in 1996. Also, according to American Thinker, “Mrs. Clinton lied about a video causing the Benghazi terror attack and is now doubling down, denying she lied to the victims’ families about the video, blaming her fabrication on the “fog of war. There’s is also her emails, which she lied about to Congress and the American people. These aren’t the inconsequential fabrications about whom she was named after, but serious false statements involving loss of American life and compromised U.S. foreign policy and national security” (Joondeph, American Thinker). Lying is not a rare thing for Mrs. Clinton. William Safire of the NY Times wrote in 1996 that Hillary “is a congenital liar.” He discussed her deception beginning in Arkansas and all way to the White House: Travelgate, Whitewater, missing billing records, and lost FBI files, to mention a few cover ups (Joondeph, American Thinker). Even in the 1970s, Mrs. Clinton was fired from her position on the Watergate House Judiciary Committee over “lies and unethical behavior” (Calabrese, Eohistory). Someone who has a track record of lying about such significant and sensitive information should not be elected president. Another way to look at her lying is that by PolitiFact’s numbers, her lying is a little less than most politicians (PolitiFact). However, that is not a reason to dismiss her untruths, as lying in any instance, especially as a public servant, is not responsible or trustworthy. And also, Politifact and other popular websites for showing facts have been discovered to have bias (politifactbias).\n\nThough Hillary Rodham Clinton is a household name, her favorability ratings are lower than ever. Even though she has been the First Lady, the Secretary of State, and a New York state senator, this does not mean she is electable. In fact, she has had a string of scandals attributed to her throughout her political career, she accepts huge sums of money from lobbyists and corporations, and she has lied on record to the American public and the US government countless times. Though she may been winning the democratic primary election at this time, we cannot overlook her corrupt and disingenuous behavior, especially when she is being currently investigated by the FBI for her mishandling of classified information on her private email servers and for her Clinton Foundation financial misdealings.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of cybernetic prosthetics?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" At present, the technological wonders people have read about in science-fiction literature are coming to life. Touchscreen cellphones, 3D-holograms, artificial intelligence, robots, and other novelties of modern engineering were impossible to create just 20 years ago. One of such novelties is cybernetic prosthetics. Scientists and engineers learned how to create true masterpieces of bionics: fully-functional cybernetic arms and legs; a prototype of a bionic eye grown from stem cells is on its way; an artificial heart is something no one feels surprised about anymore. Still, there are many opponents of such innovations. But why oppose such marvels?\n\nWhat is the point of depriving people who suffer from disabilities of the benefits that cybernetic implants can provide? A person who has lost an arm or even both arms would likely appreciate the possibility to use advanced technologies to allow him or her to hold things in his or her arms once again, to hug loved ones (there is a technology allowing the transfer of the sense of touch from an artificial limb to its owner), to write and paint comfortably, or perhaps even play a guitar or a piano. Modern prosthetics allow a connection directly to an individual’s neural system (instead of working from muscle contractions), so a person can control his or her artificial limb like a real arm. DARPA has already presented this technology in early 2016, and it probably will become available by the end of the current decade (DARPA).\n\nSpeaking of blindness, whether you are religious or not, would you deprive a blind person of the possibility to see the world again? Would it be fair, given you are healthy, to demand people with blindness to accept their fate? Yes, scientists have successfully created a retinal prosthesis system, allowing blind people to see (Time). So far, it is a low-resolution device that looks like glasses, but knowing modern technological trends, it is obvious that in about 10 years, we will be talking about implanted eye prosthetics. There is little-to-no blind people (especially those who were not born blind, but lost their sight because of an accident or sickness) who would give up a chance to be able to see. Refusing these individuals such a chance would be cruel.\n\nThis is not a thing currently, but in the nearest future, it might be possible, as the famous scientist Ray Kurzweil suggests, that people will be able to change their original body parts to cybernetic analogues (IEET). This means if you are for some reason dissatisfied with how your limbs or organs work—for example, because of rachitis—you will be able to change them. Although this does not sound like something a human being would easily do, such possibilities are on their way to fruition. For example, the first Martian pioneers (NASA plans to launch the first expedition to Mars by approximately 2030) might need severe body modifications in order to survive or adapt to harsh Martian conditions—or soldiers fighting in conflict zones might want to change their limbs to stronger cybernetic analogues. This is probably the only aspect of using cybernetic prosthetics that is disturbing, because the human race will either have to redefine what it means to be human, or at least partially accept cybernetic body augmentations for some professions. Anyways, it looks like this is the inevitable future.\n\nIt can be seen that cybernetic prosthetics is a rather controversial part of science; this controversy mostly refers to the probability of voluntarily changing one’s functional and healthy “original” limbs and organs to their superior cybernetic analogues. This is a moral dilemma humanity will have to think about in several decades. So far, cybernetic prosthetics can bring nothing but good to their owners, because their main goal is to return disabled people to a normal life: an ability to walk, run, or do sports like running for those who have lost their legs; an ability to write, paint, and touch objects with fully-functional cyber-arms for those who have no arm\\arms; in addition, there is a unique chance for blind people to see the world again due to the technology of retinal prosthesis systems. All this proves that this technology can be only for good, since it can make millions of people all over the world happier and more productive. Disability as a problem will probably completely disappear by the middle of the current century, if scientific predictions materialize.###"}
{"prompt":"How can laziness be a good thing?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Today, I intended to write an essay on laziness, but I was too indolent to do so.\n\nThe sort of thing I had in mind to write would have been exceedingly persuasive. I intended to discourse a little in favor of a greater appreciation of indolence as a benign factor in human affairs.\n\nIt is my observation that every time we get into trouble, it is due to not having been lazy enough. Unhappily, we were born with a certain fund of energy. We have been hustling about for a number of years now, and it does not seem to get us anything but tribulation. Henceforward, we are going to make a determined effort to be more languid and demure. It is the bustling man or woman who gets put on committees, who is asked to solve the problems of other people, and neglect his or her own.\n\nThe man or woman who is thoroughly and philosophically slothful is the only thoroughly happy person. It is the happy person who benefits the world. The conclusion is inescapable.\n\nI remember a saying about the meek inheriting the earth. The truly meek person is a lazy person. He or she is too modest to believe that any ferment and hubbub of his or hers can ameliorate the earth or assuage the perplexities of humanity.\n\nO. Henry said once that one should be careful to distinguish laziness from dignified repose. Alas, that was a mere quibble. Laziness is always dignified, and it is always reposeful. Philosophical laziness, I mean. The kind of laziness that is based upon a carefully-reasoned analysis of experience: acquired laziness. We have no respect for those who were born lazy; it is like being born a millionaire: they cannot appreciate their bliss. It is the person who has hammered his or her laziness out of the stubborn material of life for whom we chant praise and alleluia.\n\nThe laziest man we know—we do not like to mention his name, as the brutal world does not yet recognize sloth at its community value—is one of the greatest poets in this country; one of the keenest satirists; one of the most rectilinear thinkers. He began life in the customary hustling way. He was always too busy to enjoy himself. He became surrounded by eager people who came to him to solve their problems. “It’s a queer thing,” he said sadly, “no one ever comes to me asking for help in solving my problems.” Finally the light broke upon him. He stopped answering letters, buying lunches for casual friends and visitors from out of town, he stopped lending money to old college pals and frittering his time away on all the useless minor matters that pester the good-natured. He sat down in a secluded café with his cheek against a seidel of dark beer and began to caress the universe with his intellect.\n\nThe most damning argument against the Germans is that they were not lazy enough. In the middle of Europe, a thoroughly-disillusioned, indolent and delightful old continent, the Germans were a dangerous mass of energy and bumptious push. If the Germans had been as lazy, as indifferent, and as righteously laissez-fairish as their neighbors, the world would have been spared a great deal.\n\nPeople respect laziness. If you once get a reputation for complete, immovable, and reckless indolence, the world will leave you to your own thoughts, which are generally rather interesting.\n\nDoctor Johnson, who was one of the world’s great philosophers, was lazy. Only yesterday, our friend the Caliph showed us an extraordinarily interesting thing. It was a little leather-bound notebook in which Boswell jotted down memoranda of his talks with the old doctor. These notes he afterward worked up into the immortal Biography. And lo and behold, what was the very first entry in this treasured little relic?\n\nDoctor Johnson told me in going to Ilam from Ashbourne, 22 September, 1777, that the way the plan of his Dictionary came to be addressed to Lord Chesterfield was this: he had neglected to write it by the time appointed. Dodsley suggested a desire to have it addressed to Lord C. Mr. J. laid hold of this as an excuse for delay, that it might be better done perhaps, and let Dodsley to have his desire. Mr. Johnson said to his friend, Doctor Bathurst: “Now if any good comes of my addressing to Lord Chesterfield it will be ascribed to deep policy and address, when, in fact, it was only a casual excuse for laziness.” Thus, we see that it was sheer laziness that led to the greatest triumph of Doctor Johnson’s life, the noble and memorable letter to Chesterfield in 1775.\n\nMind your business is a good counsel, but mind your idleness also. It is a tragic thing to make a business of your mind. Save your mind to amuse yourself with.\n\nThe lazy person does not stand in the way of progress. When he or she sees progress roaring down upon him or her, he or she steps nimbly out of the way. The lazy person does not (in the vulgar phrase) pass the buck. He or she lets the buck pass him or her. We have always secretly envied our lazy friends. Now we are going to join them. We have burned our boats or our bridges, or whatever it is that one burns on the eve of a momentous decision.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the consequences of surrogacy?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Parenthood is one of the most challenging responsibilities a human being can ever bear. It is also one of the biggest joys a family can experience. However, there are many people, who—due to various reasons—cannot have children. Usually, they have little choice: either to adopt a child, or live without children. However, throughout the recent decades, there has been another option for such families: surrogacy, or surrogate maternity. Omitting the details, surrogacy is paid childbearing: a fertile woman receives payment for being impregnated and giving birth to a child of a couple who cannot have children on their own. And although to some people this might seem to be an acceptable alternative, surrogacy in fact is not only traumatizing and exploitative, but also immoral and should be proclaimed illegal.\n\nSurrogacy completely infringes on the rights of a child. It is not a secret that parents play the most significant role in a child’s development—children are also known to be extremely interested in their parentage. The Convention of the Rights of the Child proclaims that every child has a right to know their parents, to have their dignity respected and protected, to be protected from trafficking, and so on. Now, if we take a look at surrogacy, we can suddenly see that all these rights are being threatened. Cases when “customers” change their minds and decide to not have children, or refuse to accept a child because of physical or mental disability, are rather frequent. In this case, surrogate mothers give birth to children whom no one needs anymore; most likely, such children will end up in an orphanage (The Conversation). All this is an obvious violation of children’s rights.\n\nThere was a related scandal with an Australian couple who decided to “order” a child from a surrogate mother from Thailand. The genetic material would belong to parents, so the woman would only have to give birth to a child. After nine months of pregnancy, this surrogate mother gave birth to twins: a completely normal girl, and a boy with Down Syndrome (he was later named Gammy). Gammy’s genetic parents refused to bring him up, and claimed they rather would have preferred an abortion to take place. In this case, Gammy was unwanted by all the sides of the conflict: neither his biological mother, not his genetic mother were not legally obliged to take care of him (Independent.ie). Who can guarantee that this situation does not happen again? Are there ways to legally regulate parental responsibilities in the case when a child is unwanted by all contractors?\n\nIn the case of surrogacy, a child born as a result of a commercial arrangement turns into some kind of an end-product, for which customers (the wannabe parents) pay money to the executioner (surrogate mother). This is nothing else but objectification of a child. A child is being produced and sold for money: is it not human trafficking? In many countries, surrogacy is legal, or at least not prosecuted by law. The fact that it is so does not make surrogacy less dangerous, though. It is the same with alcohol: while being legal almost all over the world, it is still a dangerous drug that can lead to many unwanted consequences; analogically, surrogacy may be justified and even morally acceptable, but its actual, highly possible consequences are so drastic—mostly, for children born as a result of a commercial agreement—that it should be proclaimed illegal. Fostering is a much more safe and noble act.\n\nSurrogacy might seem to be an acceptable alternative to families who would like to have children but cannot, due to various reasons. However, surrogacy is in fact a severe violation of children’s rights, which can lead to many unforeseen consequences. There are many moral and legal gaps in this question, so surrogacy should be legally prohibited.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of spam?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Apart from the numerous benefits and conveniences people around the world can enjoy due to the Internet, there are also multiple drawbacks. Not all of them are obvious to an average user, and perhaps only professional IT workers face them from time to time. However, there is a problem almost any Internet user has encountered at least once in a lifetime. Unlike many people might think, spam is not just an annoying but harmless email message; in fact, spam can be a dangerous tool capable of harming its recipients, and should be outlawed.\n\nSpam can cause real damage. If you wonder how a mere electronic letter can be harmful, first recall the usual contents of spam letters. Along with intrusive commercials and newsletters from electronic shops you have used only once, every email user is also at risk of receiving spam letters advertising pornography, weapons, and other questionable content. Although it might be safe in the United States of America, the European Union, and some western countries, it can be illegal in more religious countries—especially in Islamic states. A citizen of such a country who has received a spam letter with porn can be thrown in jail for nothing. A person who never looked for such content might be accused of consuming it. This is not to mention child pornography, which is also distributed and advertised through spam messages (IFR).\n\nHaving to deal with spam day by day can be stressful. Even though spam messages usually have an “unsubscribe” link, getting off a spammer’s list requires a number of actions, such as visiting the website, acknowledging unsubscription, sending confirmation letters, typing the captcha, and so on. This might be not a problem in the case of being a target of several spammers; however, usually Internet users receive dozens of spam messages daily; unsubscribing from each of them is almost impossible. Many AOL users, who are now having hard times dealing with spam, report they are already nearing the point when their mailboxes stop being useful for them because of spam (Spam Abuse).\n\nSpam can be harmful in yet another way. Rather often, spam emails contain viruses such as trojans, worms, unblockable ads, bitcoin miners, and other malware; opening a message with such a program can instantly damage users’ computers. Spam is a tool for all kinds of frauds; for example, inheritance frauds are popular, when a user receives a personalized and seemingly credible email from a lawyer (often with a personal website and social media accounts) informing them about inheriting a sum of money, or real estate, and requiring them to send personal data for a final check. Spam often advertises low-quality, fake, or misleading products; various self-improvement and plastic surgery services and products are also distributed through spam—no need to say they deal more harm than use (FW2.com).\n\nAll these facts speak in favor of the necessity to proclaim spam illegal. A seemingly harmless electronic message can deal real damage: involve a user in a scam, contaminate their computer with malware, or even cause accusations in illegal actions such as distributing child pornography. Therefore, this problem should not be overlooked, and spam should be outlawed.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the positive effects of plastic surgery?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century are remarkable in terms of how beauty standards have become seemingly mandatory in the countries of the western world. If you analyze commercials on television and on the Internet, most of them will refer to beauty: all kinds of cosmetics, clothes, gyms, fitness programs, and plastic surgery are being advertised everywhere. Although the role of beauty in the modern world can be debated, and there are a lot of reasons against using plastic surgery, there are still reasons why manually changing the appearance granted by nature is acceptable.\n\nGaining self-confidence is probably one of the most important advantages a person can gain from plastic surgery. Despite common opinion, a wish to surgically correct one’s appearance may not necessarily be dictated by dysmorphophobia (a psychological condition when a person is obsessed with imaginary or real defects in his or her appearance), but can be a rational and conscious decision. Some people have physical features that have a recognizable impact on their daily lives, such as a cleft lip, skull deformations, excessive pigmentation, and so on; other people tend to perceive such features as unpleasant, and this fact can negatively affect communication and social interactions, also causing low self-esteem and depression in a person, who is, by other criteria, the same as other people, or even better. In such cases, plastic surgery not only helps to remove undesired disturbances, but also boosts self-confidence and self-esteem, granting a person the ability to live a normal life (LiveStrong.com).\n\nPlastic surgery can be undergone due to medical reasons. One of the most common examples of such surgery is a lift in the eyes and around the forehead; it helps to reduce eye pain and headaches caused by physiological defects (Occupy Theory). Another example is damage received as a result of an accident—a chemical or thermal burn, fracture, deep scars, malformation, and so on. Plastic surgery, in these cases, can be used to return a patient back to his or her original condition and appearance before the accident.\n\nThere are cases when plastic surgery improves a person’s overall health condition. This is a common effect for women who have excessively large breasts, for example; they often tend to undergo breast reduction procedures. Large breasts, unlike many people might believe, deal women a great amount of problems: pain in the back, shoulders, and loin; scoliosis; skin stretches; chafing; this is not to mention the limitation in the activities such women can do: jogging or fitness, for instance. Breast reduction helps women feel better, fixes their posture, and allows them to live a normal, fulfilling life (Health Reform Navigator).\n\nUndergoing plastic surgery is often treated as a quirk; many of its opponents refer to the negative consequences such operations have. However, plastic surgery can also have positive effects, which, in some cases, overlap potential harms. In particular, it can significantly boost a person’s self-confidence and self-esteem; it can save a person from health damage caused by physiological defects, as well as fix the consequences of different kinds of accidents. Also, plastic surgery can be beneficial for health in general. All these facts prove that plastic surgery is acceptable, and sometimes can be beneficial for one’s health.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the fur and leather industry's impact on animals?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There is a popular stereotype about people living luxurious lives—or to be precise, about how they dress. Hollywood movies, novels about beaumonde, glossy magazines, and commercials promote the idea that rich people adore wearing expensive furs and things made from natural leather. Unfortunately, it is not only rich people who wear furs and leather—all over the world, those who have money believe it is their privilege to wear clothes made from the skins of innocent animals. And although the fur and leather industry is prospering, despite the effort of PETA and other similar organizations, public opinion should be persuaded that such a consumerist approach to nature and to the lives of animals is wrong.\n\nIn prehistory, wearing clothes from furs and skins was a natural act; there were no textiles, no cotton plants, no other manufactured types of fabric; generally speaking, there was no technology allowing people to wear something except animal skins. However, with the advancement of technological progress and the invention of synthetic fibers, the real need for furs and leather has decreased. Technology allows creating artificial furs and leathers almost similar to natural ones, but for much lower prime costs, and without any harm to animals (IFR).\n\nAnimals are perhaps the most affected party. Not to mention what they are turned into, it also affects the conditions in which they are raised, and keeping them on fur farms is cruel. The closest comparison would probably be to the meat farms; fur animals are born and die on the farm, sometimes never even leaving their cages. These cages are small enough to prevent active movement during the day; such conditions harm animals not only physically, but psychologically as well—in particular, they suffer from stress and nervousness. To provide you with the approximate scales of the problem, it takes up to 80 mink skins to create one mink coat; now imagine how many animals are being tortured through inappropriate living conditions every day; this is not to mention that they are being cruelly killed through electrocution or neck-breaking—just to prevent any damage to their skins and fur (Fashion With A Heart).\n\nHowever, sometimes furs people wear are not luxurious; you could be wearing a cheap imitation without even knowing it. Do you buy furs produced in China, for example? Due to the low prices of their pelts, China has now become one of the biggest (if not the biggest) fur importers in the world. There is a horrible fact though: those pelts mostly belong to cats and dogs, not to chinchillas or foxes. Annually, more than two million cats and dogs are killed in China for their fur—not the best material for a luxurious coat. Some of these animals still have their collars on them when caught or slaughtered; many of these animals are alive when factory workers hang them up for skinning. Once again, to prevent any possible damage to furs, cats and dogs are being strangled in their cages (Daily Mail).\n\nAll this is cruel and unfair. Even though many animal species with fur are not being hunted—so it might seem there is no damage dealt to wild nature—the conditions in which they are bred and raised are horrible. Minks, chinchillas, and other species have to live in narrow, small cages, preventing movement and causing them physical and mental harm. This is not to mention the cruel ways of slaughtering. Besides, there are synthetic substitutes for furs and leathers, which are cheaper, similar to natural ones, and the production of which does not involve dealing damage to animals.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the reasons why teachers should not add their students as friends on Facebook?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Since the times when Facebook and other social media networks gained popularity, the word “friends” has evolved. Along with the traditional meaning, it also started to mean people whom you get online updates and messages from, whom you inform about your recent activities, whom you get in touch with virtually, and so on. At the same time, a “friend” on Facebook can actually be a random person, a stranger whom you have seen only once or twice. People add new “friends” easily; this is related especially to teenagers and students, who tend to “friend” everyone they meet, including their teachers. Some people see it as a positive sign, assuming that virtual friendship will help make studying more fun and simple. However, there are strong reasons behind teachers’ decisions not to add students as friends on Facebook or other social media platforms.\n\nThe most significant concern is privacy, and perhaps teachers are more vulnerable in these terms than teenagers. Through Facebook and other social media platforms, students might learn details from the lives of their teachers which they are not supposed to learn: information about intimate relationships, vacations, and so on. This does not mean a teacher has no right to spend time the way he or she wants, and share information about it; it means that before doing this, teachers have to consider the possible effect and the consequences of such sharing (KidsSafe Foundation). This connection works both ways though: a teacher might use Facebook to see the details of their students’ most recent party on campus, for example. Needless to say that instead of making relationships between teachers and students easier, such exposure only makes them more intense: both teachers and students become vulnerable, and bear more risks or harassment of different kinds.\n\nThis problem logically transforms into disciplinary issues. The teacher-student relationship is often built on a hierarchical basis: students recognize their teacher as an outsider imbued with certain authority; this is a natural border helping establish discipline. However, by becoming digital friends with their students, teachers exhaust these borders and may lose authority. It becomes more difficult for them to discipline and reason with students, because they are (kind of) personally acquainted, and have a (sort of) relationship beyond the classroom. Besides, students with personal Facebook relationships with their teachers could be given extra credits or benefits in terms of studying (Patch.com).\n\nErasing borders between teachers and students might lead to unexpected and inappropriate consequences, including sexual relationships, which is not just illegal, but also considered immoral by many people. Cases of such relationships are numerous; for example, in 2013, a former cheerleader and a high school teacher, Sarah Jones, pleaded guilty to having sex with a 17-year-old student, Cody York, who was careless enough to upload photos of himself and his teacher on Facebook. These photos went viral, causing a scandal and drawing attention to the problem of student-teacher relationships once again (The Current). It does not mean that Facebook relationships usually transform into personal or sexual ones; it means, however, that relationships beyond the borders established by a society might end up in an unexpected and inappropriate way that can hurt both a student and a teacher.\n\nThere exist at least several significant reasons why teachers should not add their students as friends on Facebook. One of them is privacy concerns: teachers who share their lives on Facebook—as well as students doing the same—cannot feel safe knowing their posts might be seen by the wrong audience. Also, erasing borders between students and teachers might not only lead to a drop of discipline, but sometimes transform into personal relationships, which usually tends to end up in a scandalous and\/or painful way. Therefore, teachers and students should keep a certain distance, and communicate mostly within the limits of studying.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of young people living independently from their parents?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Throughout the recent decades, American youth seem to have become overprotected by parents, relatives, municipal services, and the society in which we live in. The ways in which different obstacles, substances, and occupations affect young people are numerous: our society tries to protect young people from every little misfortune that might occur in their lives and politicians appeal to youth protection problems to gain political benefits. All this may create an image of a young person as a subtle and tender being that needs to be protected and taken care of, otherwise something terrible might happen. This is annoying; the only and the best possible thing that can be done by parents for their children is to let them live their lives separately.\n\nContrary to the popular opinion that the surveillance of young people helps protect them from substance abuse, bad influences, and all kinds of troubles, it is not true. If a person is poorly raised, no surveillance and parental control can keep them away from trouble; on the contrary, a well-raised person can prosper even when living away from parents for a long time.\n\nThe benefits of independent living for a developing personality are obvious. One of them is that such a person quickly becomes self-sufficient and learns how to sustain themselves—they have to do it. The most common scenario is when a teenager goes to college, which often implies living in a different city, on campus, or a rented apartment. Staying at home with parents allows young people to live by predefined parental rules and affords the luxury of being unemployed (Synonym). However, the sooner a young person leaves his or her parents and leaps into the adult world, the sooner he or she will understand the value of money and honest labor; the sooner he or she will learn to organize his or her schedule; start developing and improving his or her skills to be competitive in the labor market; he or she will also stop being a financial burden for his or her parents, or at least share the part of financial expenditures with them. In other words, being a worker bee is better than being a drone.\n\nAnother advantage of living separately from parents is independence and the ability to learn about how to make decisions and take responsibility for them. Parents can (rather often, subconsciously) suppress their children by controlling them and\\or pass on their own rules and expectations. A young person living with parents has more chances (or risks) to adopt behaviors and reactions of the older generation, instead of developing his or her own alternatives. Living with parents can be relaxing and comfortable, meaning that a teen can always count on his or her parents’ help when facing problems; a teen can afford to avoid making decisions, knowing that his or her parents would do this instead; teens living with parents have fewer chances and ways to express their individuality, and so on. However, this is not the comfort that can do much good for a person in terms of his or her future life. When a young man or woman lives away from parents, his or her has to take responsibility for his or her lives, faces stress, solves problems, seeks earnings, and so on—otherwise he or she will not last long, and will have to return home without accomplishing anything (IFR).\n\nWhat is also important is that living away from parents, a young person has more chances to find the occupation he or she loves, and avoid risks of ending up employed in a family business or undesirable local work (Debatewise.org).There is nothing bad in working in a family business, and if a young person feels like doing so, it can only be greeted and encouraged. However, some parents tend to ignore the needs and career ambitions of their children, believing that participating in a family business is the only worthwhile alternative for them. The same refers to local work: building a career in a small province town is harder, and opportunities are fewer than in cities like New York, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Therefore, to be able to fulfill their own goals and build careers, it is crucial for young people to start living on their own.\n\nAlthough there is a strong belief that young people living away from parental surveillance tend to get into various troubles, in fact this is not necessarily so. Living away from parents can teach a youngster to sustain themselves, and help parents with their finances; it can be beneficial in terms of helping a young person develop an independent way of thinking and new values, and teaching him or her real responsibility. Besides, living alone (often conjoined with having to move to a different city) can be a kickstart for a career in a big city, or at least a way to escape participation in a boring family business. Therefore, young people should seek to start living separately from parents as soon as possible.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages of a desktop computer over a laptop?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Mobility nowadays is kind of a sacred cow for the western world. Being able to go anywhere and keep in touch with the rest of the world regardless of one’s whereabouts is highly valued and cultivated. Vendors and manufacturers of all kinds of devices make mobility one of the main features of their products. Smartphones, tablets, ebooks, and especially laptops can be seen as perfect examples of mobile technologies. A regular laptop is a technological wonder, allowing its owner to work and have fun anywhere. Modern laptops are powerful and useful machines; however, considering this, a question arises: is there still a point in using big stationary desktop computers? The answer is “definitely yes.” A stationary desktop computer is still better than even the best of laptops, even though it is huge, it takes a lot of space, has loads of cords and wires connected to it, and you cannot put it in your bag.\n\nWhy? The reasons are many. One of them is productivity. A desktop machine with an nVidia GeForce 9800GT video card, Intel Core i7 4GHz processor, two terabytes HDD, and 16 gigabytes of RAM is not a unique configuration—although quite expensive. Moreover, this is not the top specifications a desktop machine can reach. A laptop with hardware at least approximately close to these specifications would cost astronomical sums of money. In addition, laptops often have rather poor displays, which is a drawback for designers. Of course, there are Apple laptops with retina displays, but once again, they cost the same or are even more than a powerful desktop computer with a IPS-matrix 27” monitor. So, the first advantage of desktop computers is the balance between their computing and processing capabilities, and their price (IFR).\n\nUpgrade options is a advantage of desktop computers. On average, every three years, a once-powerful hardware becomes obsolete. New operation systems, ever-increasing requirements for all kinds of software, games, graphic processing programs, and other utilities require higher computing capabilities. A desktop computer consists of modules: video card, processor, RAM, HDD, motherboard, and so on. Each of these modules can be easily changed; when you need a new video card, you buy a newer model and install it on your desktop; if you have minimal technology knowledge, you can even do it on your own. The same refers to other modules. Laptops are not even close to desktops when it comes to the variety of upgrade options. Once again, upgrading a desktop computer is much cheaper.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages of e-books over printed books?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Modern digital technologies today can easily substitute almost any analog that people had been using for decades or even centuries. Bulky vinyl players have turned into tiny iPods, huge TV sets have become super-flat plasma wall panels, phones are getting more and more impossible to distinguish from pocket computers, and so on. Books have also undergone such a transformation, and today many people prefer using an electronic book, or e-book, rather than a regular printed one. Why? Because e-books are in every possible way better than printed books, no matter what the antique book lovers say.\n\nThe most obvious advantage is portability. If you have been a book lover for a long time, you most likely had to carry a book or two with you wherever you go. If you could afford carrying a backpack around, it was not a problem; however, if you are a lady or a clerk in some serious corporation, most likely you either had to fit a book into your purse or folder, or leave it at home. On the other hand, any modern e-book is almost flat and light weight, so you can easily carry one—even in your pocket. You can read it in any position, and take it anywhere with you. By the way, try to make it comfortable to read a printed book while lying on your side—it is almost impossible (Snarkynomad.com). With an e-book device, all your problems with a book’s weight and shape are solved.\n\nThe next reason why e-books are more preferable is that even a cheap e-book device allows one to carry the whole Library of Congress in your pocket. Depending on an e-book device’s memory capacity, you can store gigabytes of data on your device. The file format is usually not a problem: many e-book devices support all popular formats of electronic books, such as fb2, djvu, pdf, azw, kfx, and so on.\n\nAlso, electronic books are reasonably cheaper than printed ones, and the price  depends on which store you buy them at, so in fact you can get a lot of books for a humble price. A device costs more than a book, but this difference in prices pays off quickly (Spreeder.com).\n\nWe live in a age when ecological problems have turned from unproven scientific hypotheses to a disturbing reality. Vanishing of the Amazonian rainforests, massive deforestation all over the planet, and the extinction of species of plants are only some parts of a larger ecological problem. The industry of book printing contributes significantly to global warming, because for the paper on which books are printed, they need to cut down trees. There are many books printed on recycled paper as well, but their overall percentage is tiny. Therefore, by preferring an e-book over a printed one, a customer can actively contribute to the matter of saving trees. The less print books you buy, the more trees you help to save (Epublishers Weekly).\n\nIf you like old things, then you most likely stand for print books. However, the majority of rational people today stand for e-books, and there are several strong reasons for this. E-books not only help to save the environment (since they do not need paper to be printed on), but they also take up less space, are cheaper, and allow owners to carry entire libraries in their pockets, wherever they would go. All this proves that choosing an e-book over a printed one is a wise and reasonable decision.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of smoking shisha?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Although smoking tobacco is considered an anti-social and unhealthy habit almost worldwide, there are still countless smokers who continue believing there is nothing bad in inhaling smoke that contains nicotine and carcinogenic tars. Many of them, in order to mask their addiction to nicotine, or in an attempt to quit smoking cigarettes, switch to other forms of nicotine consumption—in particular, shisha smoking. They claim shisha to be less harmful for health, and more acceptable from the social point of view, because shisha smoke often has a fruit flavor, unlike cigarettes. However, there is strong evidence that smoking shisha is much more harmful for a smoker’s health than regular cigarettes or pipes.\n\nAccording to numerous research studies, the smoke one inhales through a shisha pipe contains high levels of health-damaging substances. In particular, a shisha smoker inhales a cocktail of tar, carbon monoxide, carcinogens, some heavy metals, and other highly-toxic compounds. In this aspect, shisha is not too different from a cigarette; prolonged smoking of it leads to lung cancer, oral cancer, heart and vascular diseases, emphysema, and other typical illnesses all smokers develop sooner or later (Mayo Clinic).\n\nWhat is more disturbing, however, is that a regular shisha smoker makes much deeper inhales, which automatically increases the amount of these substances in his or her body. To be precise, shisha is usually being smoked for about one hour and more, and during this period of time, a regular smoker does approximately 200 puffs; at the same time, smoking a cigarette takes about five minutes and 20 puffs; mathematically, the volume of harmful smoke inhaled by a shisha smoker during one session is around ten times larger. A shisha smoker inhales 90,000 milliliters of smoke during one session, compared to only 500 milliliters inhaled by a cigarette smoker. This allows to assume that one session of smoking shisha is about as harmful as smoking a pack of cigarettes (CDC).\n\nAmong the immediate health effects that a shisha smoker—especially an inexperienced one—may feel after one session are severe headaches, dizziness and nausea, the lack of coordination of movements, pain in the chest, and increased heartbeat and breath. There is also no guarantee that pipes are properly disinfected after previous smokers; although in many shisha bars, customers use special mouthpieces, it does not prevent saliva infiltrating into the pipe. Shisha can form a strong addiction—much stronger than cigarettes—due to increased doses of nicotine a smoker consumes. Besides, shisha smoke is not so bad-smelling and choke-inducing as the smoke of regular cigarettes (on the contrary, it is smooth and smells like mint or fruit), so it is easier to develop a habit of smoking shisha regularly.\n\nAll these facts prove the statement that shisha is in fact a more dangerous habit than regular tobacco smoking. It does not mean it is better to smoke cigarettes, but rather that one should not smoke at all. Shisha smoke contains a vast amount of carcinogens, heavy metals, carbon dioxide, and tar, and during one smoking session, a shisha smoker consumes huge amounts of smoke containing these poisons. Smoking shisha can lead to severe headaches, nausea, problems with heartbeat, and so on. Besides, no one can guarantee that shisha pipes are properly sanitized after the use of previous smokers. All this makes shisha a bad choice for those seeking to substitute regular cigarettes.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the Apple Watch, and why is it not worth purchasing?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Apple has continually been the company able to astonish and amaze. Its previous CEO and guru Steve Jobs was a genius of marketing; when he was alive, Apple kept surprising its customers year after year. However, recently Apple started to remind of an old lady who tries to act young; some of its products seem to be useless trinkets rather than practical and revolutionary. This unflattering remark refers to Apple Watch—one of Apple’s most recent gadgets; although Apple fans are already drooling over it, there is, in fact, no reason why someone should pay a large sum for this product.\n\nThere is nothing special about the Apple Watch. Among the most important features developers (and marketers) emphasize is the ability to show notifications when your phone’s screen is locked; incoming text analysis—the watch screens emails and other incoming information and suggests reply options; quick voice messaging and customizable emojis; a heap of fitness functions, such as the measurement of heart rate, a workout organizer, and so on; Siri is traditionally on board, as well as Maps (Mashable).\n\nBut is all this so outstanding? The notification function simply moves the vibration from your pocket to your wrist when the phone is off. Stick your iPhone to your hand with a duct tape, and you will get a similar experience. The text analysis system, subjectively, is one of the most controversial and least needed functions. Where is the guarantee that it will always work correctly? Even though it suggests possible reply options, you will still have to read through them to check whether the reply is accurate; it does not save much time. And if you decide to not double-check, and simply send the message right away, just imagine yourself replying to your boss’ message with something like, “Sorry, sweetheart, I have a headache, let’s do it next time.” This function makes the communicator—the user—almost useless, leaving them as a passive spectator. Quick voice messaging is not revolutionary either—tons of apps can do that, starting from Viber and ending up with exotic (in the West) LINE. The same goes for fitness functions. As for customizable emojis, it is definitely not an icing on a cake that costs $600.\n\nBesides, this gadget does not fit the Apple environment well. The only sync it can establish is with an iPhone. If you, however, have an Apple phone older than an iPhone 5s, be prepared for your Apple Watch to be inert and a detached piece of plastic and metal. Why is it bad? Many people still use iPhones of the 5th or even 4th generation, because they work fine, and the new ones cost a lot. So, if they ever want to purchase an Apple Watch, they have to pay additional $500 (approximately) for an iPhone 5s. Users of Android phones cannot use the gadget either (Whatculture.com).\n\nThe Apple Watch is a product of high quality marketing. As usual, Apple has offered something that millions of customers immediately felt amazed and intrigued with; however, behind this wall of awe, they cannot see that the Apple Watch is not outstanding in any aspect. It is expensive, it does not work well in the Apple environment, it possesses a bunch of functions that any smartphone—even a mediocre one—can perform at the same, or even better level. So, is it worth purchasing it? The answer is most likely no.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of keeping exotic animals as pets?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Wild nature is home for hundreds of thousands of species, many of which are exotic and\/or close to extinction. Throughout recent decades, humanity has made a solid effort in order to prevent the extinction of these animals, protect the habitat of these species, and somehow minimize the negative consequences of the presence of humans. However, there is another problem that has not been paid enough attention to—this problem is keeping exotic animals as pets. Although owners of exotic animals might believe they are not doing anything bad, in fact such a practice should be prohibited due to a number of reasons.\n\nAlmost no one, except perhaps the richest people, can provide a wild animal with all its necessary conditions. Exotic animals have unique needs. For example, wild tigers need a large territory to roam around in. A venomous Monocled cobra, which can be legally bought in a number of states for a puny $100, will repeatedly strike when feeling in danger. A bobcat can hunt a prey eight times bigger than itself. Chimpanzees and other primates require a lot of space for climbing, and sea mammals need vast water basins to swim freely. The examples are numerous. These needs require specific living conditions—or at least housing structures. Can an average American citizen afford keeping an exotic pet? Not just for a year or two, but for 25 or 50 years? Just for an example, the annual cost of keeping a tiger (in a cage) approaches $6,000. Clearly, being a keeper of a wild animal is beyond the capabilities of an average citizen (National Geographic).\n\nIf the previous paragraph did not persuade you, consider the danger of biological contamination. According to different estimates, at least one in three reptiles (which are among the most popular exotic pets—iguanas, for example) is a host for salmonella and shigella bacteria; the overall percentage with salmonella is probably up to 90 percent. According to data provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 90 percent of imported green iguanas carry unfamiliar strains of intestinal bacteria. Other species are not safer. About 25 percent of both imported and domestically-bred macaques are reported to have had the herpes B virus. Among other diseases carried and transported by wild animals, one should mention such infections as chlamydia, yaba virus, giardia, tuberculosis, measles, marburg virus, hepatitis A, campylobacteriosis, rabies, streptothricosis, and a lot of other malicious microorganisms, including worms (ASPCA).\n\nIn addition, wild animals can pose a direct physical threat to their owners. During the last 10 years, there have been dozens of attacks committed by captive big cats, such as lions and tigers; in one of the saddest incidents, a tiger killed a three-year-old boy, who was its guardian’s grandson. In another case, a Bengal tiger has bitten off an arm of a four-year-old boy. Since the beginning of the century, four people were hunted down (and killed) by wolf hybrids. This is not to mention the cases when wild animals attacked other domesticated pets—cats, dogs, and so on (PETA).\n\nAlong with well-known ecological problems—such as the extinction of species, or the destruction of rainforests, there is also another significant issue: people tend to keep exotic wild animals as pets. This is a bad practice, since wild animals require unique conditions that an average American cannot afford; exotic animals carry and transmit exotic diseases, which can pose a threat to owners; and there were numerous incidents when a captivated wild animal attacked its owner, or members of their families. All this is solid proof in favor of the claim that wild exotic animals should not be kept as pets.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the reasons for banning cell phones in high schools?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A regular cell phone nowadays is a portable computer allowing its owner to solve multiple tasks anywhere, anytime. Along with this, a cell phone provides numerous entertainment options, which are especially valued by the younger generation—high school students, in particular. Whereas having a cell phone for a teenager is already seen as a must, in some situations teenagers should be required to be abstained from using their gadgets for certain periods of time, and one place where they should be abstained from is at school.\n\nThere are numerous reasons why high school students should not be allowed to use their cell phones, tablets, and other gadgets at school, not to mention during classes. One of them is a severe cell phone addiction that teenagers can develop if they overuse their devices. According to a study by Gaby Badre, in such cases, teenagers tend to experience “increased restlessness with more careless lifestyles, more consumption of stimulating beverages, difficulty in falling asleep and disruptive sleep, and more susceptibility to stress and fatigue.” They may also have headaches and, what is curious, experience phantom ringing sounds (when a person thinks his or her phone is ringing when it is not). This is what distracts teenagers during studying, and keeps them awake at night, when they should be sleeping. All this does not speak in favor of allowing teenagers the use of cell phones in high school, where they are not necessary(Teen Ink).\n\nAlong with the health problems caused by the excessive use of cell phones, parents should be concerned about how teenagers use cell phones. It is not a secret that the adolescent subculture is strongly based on hierarchy; those who do not manage to fit in often become bullied by their more-fortunate peers. In these terms, cell phones provide limitless opportunities for what is called cyber-bullying. For example, camera phones can be secretly used almost anywhere, including private areas (such as restrooms and locker rooms), where bullies can take embarrassing photos of their victims; then, using their cell phones, bullies can spread these photos around school in no time, upload them to YouTube, or publicly humiliate their victims in some other way. This is not to mention sexual harassment (applications like SnapChat make it easy), digital revenge for broken relationships, hacking and stalking, and so on (Safe Search Kids). It is impossible to control a student outside of school, but doing this during classes is not difficult.\n\nAccording to British research of cell phone policies of Birmingham, London, Leicester, and Manchester schools, their effects on students’ performance has shown that schools that banned cell phones demonstrated an increase in test scores by 6.4% for 16-year-old students. These results seem to be significant for the United States as well, since about 73% of American teenagers use cell phones (compared to 90% of British students). These gains were observed among students with the lowest achievements, and among average students these results were doubled. This shows that banning cell phones has a great impact on students’ performances, and in terms of increasing the quality of education, such measures would be beneficial (Time).\n\nAs it can be seen, cell phones, if used improperly, can negatively affect a teenager’s life in a number of ways. In particular, an adolescent can develop restlessness and anxiety (along with a cell phone addiction), which is unacceptable at such a young age. Due to the peculiarities of school life and the way teenagers interact with each other, cell phones can be used for bullying—for example, secretly taking embarrassing photos of classmates in private areas, and so on. In addition, using cell phones in schools negatively affects performance; in schools where the use of cell phones has been banned, students’ performance increased significantly. These reasons definitely speak in favor of prohibiting teenagers using cell phones in high schools.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the pros and cons of euthanasia?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" During the last 100 years, medicine has advanced incredibly; humanity has learned to treat diseases that have killed thousands of people throughout centuries. However, there still are many sicknesses that not only cannot be cured at present, but also cause incredible suffering to people who have them. Patients with such diseases might want to ask for euthanasia, as life can be torturous for them. However, societies and laws of different countries trat euthanasia as something immoral and illegal—which is not necessarily right. Terminally sick people who are in extreme pain or suffering should be granted the right to euthanasia.\n\nOften, a patient’s life is much worse than death. There are numerous diseases that modern medicine cannot cure, and which cause severe pain and suffering to patients. For example, the “locked in” syndrome: people who have it cannot move a single muscle. One of such sufferers, Tony Nicklinson, in 2010 and 2012 was denied his right to die by the British High Court. Unable to commit suicide himself and also unable to ask anyone to help him end his life (sufferers of the “locked in” syndrome cannot move even their tongue or eyeballs), Tony starved himself to death (Listverse.com). The number of patients suffering from this and other diseases, who have no other way to stop their suffering, is uncountable, but they are doomed to live. Is it not unfair that they are not allowed to end this suffering?\n\nThe opponents of euthanasia claim that helping a person to die is wrong, because one can never know when the cure for a terminal disease will be invented, or when recovery will occur; thus, claim the opponents, euthanasia shortens life spans of patients. However, according to statistics, in 86% of the cases, euthanasia shortened a patient’s life no more than one week—usually, just a couple of hours. Patients ask for euthanasia when their chances for recovery are nearly impossible; besides, the last days of a patient’s life are usually full of agony and excruciating pain, and euthanasia is the only way to stop it (Listland.com).\n\nIn addition, it should be mentioned that sustaining life in a terminally-ill body is cruel. As it has been mentioned, terminal diseases are usually accompanied by unbearable pain and suffering. At the same time, there is no premise to believe that the cure for such diseases as the “locked in” syndrome or brain cancer will be invented in the nearest future. At the same time, sometimes it is possible to keep patients alive for months and years, which means they will suffer throughout this period of time. Is it not similar to torture? Assurances and promises that there will be a cure someday do not deny the fact that doctors (and relatives of an ill person) consciously keep a patient in pain and humiliation for an undetermined period of time. Doing this violates a number of individual’s rights, and should not be tolerated (IFR).\n\nAs we can see, in some cases, euthanasia is justified. There are diseases that cause severe suffering; sometimes, a patient might try to commit suicide to end this suffering; life for such patients is worse than death. Euthanasia is not killing; it is more like bringing a patient’s inevitable death closer—according to the statistics, patients usually ask for euthanasia a maximum of one week before they would die. In addition, keeping a person alive against their will and making him or her withstand pain and suffering is not different from torture, and thus should not be allowed: if a patient wants to die, and his or her condition is truly hopeless, relatives, doctors, and law should not prevent them from doing so.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of having a prayer time in public schools?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A couple of centuries ago, religious beliefs were not a question to start debates around—a person was either a believer, or others would squint at them. Nowadays, it has become possible to profess any beliefs, including atheism, Scientology, or Rastafarianism. Still, since the U.S. remains a rather conservative and religious country, from time to time different communities concerned about morality and the ethical education of children raise the question of whether there should be a time for silent prayer in public schools. Although many opponents tend to see it as an offence and an act of imposing religion, there are rational reasons why there should be such a time in public schools.\n\nThe approach in which it is done can be different. If a teacher says, “Alright, now you have five minutes to say your prayers to God, and then we start the class,” then it can be seen as imposing religious beliefs; some children might not believe in God, some might believe in many gods, so such a phrase could be fairly called intrusive. However, this “prayer time” can be introduced in a different way. A teacher might say, “Alright, children, now you have five free minutes. You can say your prayers, or meditate, or simply think about something good, and then we begin class. But no talking!” In this case, there is no inculcation, since children have a number of alternatives of what to do in the allotted time (FRU).\n\nIn connection with this, it is important to mention why this “prayer time” (or meditation time, or positive thinking time—call it as you will) is valuable. Any prayer is a set of positive affirmations and images; the same refers to meditation or imagining something pleasant. Researchers have long ago proved the fact that positive thinking has invigorating effects on the human body; in particular, positive thinkers enjoy an increased life span, lower rates of stress, a better psychological condition, physical well-being, better coping skills, and so on (Mayo Clinic). Considering this, it is unclear how it would harm children’s’ mental condition or cognitive capabilities if they had regular short sessions of positive thinking—in any of its forms.\n\nMoreover, modern public schools in the U.S. provide education to children belonging to numerous religious confessions, ideological systems, and with different cultural backgrounds. The discussed time before classes would be a chance to show children what tolerance is in practice; children would learn how to respect the views of people surrounding them. This would also help to make children in classes more closely-knit, respecting, and friendly to each other (IFR).\n\nAlthough there are numerous opponents of so called “prayer time” in public schools, in fact there is nothing bad about it. When introduced properly, and children have alternatives to what to do during this time (for example, meditate or think about something pleasant), such sessions can positively affect them. Children would learn to respect beliefs other than theirs, and would learn what tolerance is in practice. Besides, they would enjoy all the benefits of positive thinking, such as an increased life span, a better psychological and physical condition, better coping skills, and so on.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages of single-sex schools?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In recent years, the question of whether male and female students should study in separate classes has been widely discussed. The opponents of this educational approach argue that if boys and girls do not study together, they cannot develop skills and communication habits necessary to interact with the opposite sex. However, providing education separately for boys and girls has advantages that outweigh the possible inconveniences of this approach.\n\nAlthough people today are losing their minds about trying to minimize differences between genders, biology often remains unswerving: different sexes tend to have different learning styles. This occurs because male and female brains work differently. Such differences—and studying styles that result from these differences—can be best explored in separate classrooms. This does not mean separating girls from boys will automatically help increase grades in both groups; however, understanding the core differences in learning styles, and adjusting lesson plans according to this knowledge will definitely help improve the overall quality of education (Gettingboystoread.com).\n\nAccording to a study conducted in Australia, in which approximately 270,000 students participated, both male and female students showed much better results in standardized tests when they attended separate schools rather than schools where boys and girls studied in the same classrooms. During an older experiment, held in Virginia in 1995, 100 eighth graders were separated while studying math and science courses, and almost immediately girls became more active, displayed more confidence, and achieved better results in general (Dooneducation.com). Therefore, separate education makes the studying process more comfortable for girls, allowing them to benefit more from it.\n\nStudies also show that girls attending single-sex schools were more likely to enter and attend a four-year college than girls studying at regular co-educational schools. The same conclusion applied for boys who studied in all-boys schools. Boys in single-sex schools also earned higher test scores (NASSPE). This allows to presume that when students do not get distracted (and harassed, because harassment is typical for children and teenagers) by the opposite sex, they tend to improve in terms of discipline and academic performance. Hence, this is yet another advantage of single-sex schools.\n\nAlthough the question about whether boys and girls should study separately remains debated and open, there are several significant arguments in favor of single-sex schools. Separating girls from boys allows to develop effective studying plans that would take the peculiarities of male and female studying styles into account. When students do not get distracted or harassed by the opposite sex, they tend to perform better in terms of discipline and academic results; according to studies, students from single-sex schools show better test results, and are more likely to enter four-year colleges. Therefore, the advantages of single-sex schools should be taken into account.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the reasons why college athletes should be paid?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Team sports like soccer or basketball, as well as individual sports, are extremely popular worldwide. Famous sportsmen and sportswomen have statuses similar to Hollywood celebrities, and their wages are high. However, no matter how well they play, all of them have once been amateurs; in this perspective, high school or college athletes are not much different from professionals. At the same time, the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) prohibits college athletes to be monetarily compensated for their efforts, which is definitely unfair. College athletes should be paid their due for a number of reasons.\n\nThe NCAA should pay student athletes because it can do it. According to polls among economists, there are no financial factors that prevent the NCAA from paying their athletes. In particular, Rodney Fort, a sports economist and professor of sports management at the University of Michigan, believes that the NCAA already possesses enough money to do so. Moreover, arguments that additional labor costs would hurt sports programs at schools are groundless, says David Berri, a professor of economics at Southern Utah University. “They’re nonprofits, and their incentive is to spend every cent that comes in,” he says (Huffingtonpost.com).\n\nSpeaking of skills, by the way, the fact that an athlete is a college student does not automatically mean he or she is an amateur (unlike what the NCAA officially claims). For example, a typical first division college football player trains approximately 43.3 hours per week; for contrast, a typical American work week is only 40 hours. Besides, college athletes also need to dedicate time to studying; along with this, NCAA tournament rules require college students to skip classes in favor of nationally-televised games that bring in revenue (Forbes). No need to say that the revenue goes to the NCAA. Considering this, is it not obvious that college athletes should receive at least some compensation for their efforts?\n\nPaying college athletes could also solve a significant problem of athletes quitting schools and colleges. It is not a secret that many of them make a decision to leave due to financial reasons; usually, they are allured by the perspective to start earning money with what they can do best (sports) outside of college. Indeed, what is the point for a prospective professional athlete to rush between sports and study for free if they can earn real money doing what they love, and without any obstacles? Paying college athletes could help keep many of them within their schools\/colleges, and help them earn a degree (TheSportster).\n\nThe reasons why college athletes should be paid are significant. First of all, the NCAA has all the capabilities to pay their athletes—it accumulates tons of revenue annually, so supporting college athletes would not be a problem. Besides, despite that the NCAA officially recognizes college athletes as amateurs, in fact these “amateurs” train 43 hours a week on average, in addition to studying. And lastly, many college athletes prefer to start earning real money with their skills rather than rush between sports and study for free, and thus quit schools; paying them might help solve this problem.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of studying Spanish for a student in the United States?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If you live in the United States, you must have rarely or even never thought about studying foreign languages. Indeed, why would you? English is spoken in both Americas (mostly), Europe, Slavic countries, and even India; only China, Japan, and some other far east countries have problems with the English language. However, being able to speak a foreign language—at least one—nowadays is becoming a necessity. Spanish, among all other foreign languages, seems to be the most necessary for the United States, and every U.S. student should know it. Why?\n\nFor the United States, Spanish is not a foreign language anymore. With a regular flow of new immigrants from South America, as well as with the extensive growth of a Spanish-speaking population, which is large already, Spanish is rapidly becoming the second-most-used language in the United States in terms of the amount of speakers. According to a Pew Research Center report, an estimated 37.6 million people in the U.S. speak Spanish as their first language; in 2060, analysts predict the United States will have 128.8 million people for whom Spanish is their native language, thus turning the country into the world’s largest Spanish-speaking country (Businessinsider.com). Considering all this, Caucasian, African American, and Asian students (and people of all ages) might want to be able to improve communications with such an enormous group of people; soon enough, it will be a regular situation when in some public places, there will be nine Hispanic people for one-two persons of another skin color.\n\nBeing bilingual in a global world is another preference that one might consider when studying Spanish (Huffingtonpost.com). If you have ever traveled to another country, you might have experienced problems with communicating with local population. Since Spanish-speaking countries are among the most popular touristic destinations for U.S citizens, would it not be great to be able to freely explore, say, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, or Spain without running into a language barrier? Besides, consider the possibility of access to one of the world’s richest cultural paradigms, books, movies, and traditions; also, consider career opportunities—for a bilingual person, doors of many prestigious companies are often wide open.\n\nIn addition, Spanish is not that difficult of a language to learn. Although many Americans are secretly afraid to try learning a foreign language, it is not that difficult—and Spanish is rather simple, especially in terms of pronunciation and spelling (although grammar might sometimes be a little tricky). But people successfully learn and speak Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and even Georgian (which is, in fact, one of the world’s most difficult languages). Of all them, Spanish is almost the easiest to learn—in about a year, you can speak it competently (EduSpain.com).\n\nStudying Spanish nowadays is a good choice, especially for U.S. students. The number of Spanish-speaking people in the U.S. is growing, and it is important to maintain communication with the Spanish-speaking community. The Spanish language is widely spoken in many countries of the western world, so it is a solid choice if you want to travel, or to learn other cultures. Also, Spanish is not that difficult of a language to learn—in a year, you will be able to communicate almost fluently if you study each day. Based on all this, it is clear that studying Spanish language for a U.S. student is a perfect choice.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the reasons behind the security measures in airports?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Due to intensive technological progress during the recent two centuries, humanity has achieved a lot of what has been considered impossible in earlier epochs; flight is one of them. Today, if you have enough money to afford an airplane ticket, you can travel far distances in almost no time. Although statistically being the safest type of public transport, airplanes are vulnerable to the threat of terrorism. Because of this, airline companies implement strict security rules and checks, and force passengers to submit to them, thus causing frustration and discontent; sometimes these checks may seem excessive and even humiliating, even though they are mandatory.\n\nOne of the security measures that often causes misunderstanding and questions is having to take off shoes and to place them on an X-Ray belt. Before, bins were used to check if there were something hidden inside a shoe, but today, scanners are being used more and more often. The reason for this is that bins are usually cluttered with the articles passengers take out of their bags, or take off themselves, so scanners allow faster, more thorough, and stress-free checking for airport staff (Transportation Security Administration). Besides, X-Ray scanning can detect objects that might be hidden, for example, within a shoe’s sole (IFR). Thus, checking one’s shoes is a necessary measure directly connected to security.\n\nAnother strange requirement is the limited quantity of liquid a passenger can take on board. In fact, liquids can pose a great threat to aviation, because they can be used as ingredients for bombs; in 2006, the liquid bomb plot was revealed. Terrorists planned to create bombs that would look like liquids (water, soda), placed in regular plastic bottles (BBC News). Since 2006, numerous research studies and explosives testing were conducted in order to determine what liquid quantities are safe to bring aboard an aircraft (Transportation Security Administration). As it can be seen, liquids are not all that innocent, and this is why passengers can take only limited quantities of them.\n\nHaving to take electronics, such as laptops, cameras, and so on out of your luggage is also necessary. The reason for this is that would-be terrorists can tamper with the insides of a laptop or a cellphone to turn it into a device that could cause damage (for example, a detonator). Airport security services screen the insides of electronic devices to see if nothing was changed inside; airport security officers know how the insides of electronic devices should look like, so any discrepancies do not remain unnoticed. If something seems suspicious, officers take necessary measures to prevent possible acts of terrorism (Transportation Security Agency).\n\nSecurity measures in airports—even the weirdest—have a strong rationale behind them. For example, the requirement to take off shoes and placing them in an X-Ray scanner is connected to the detection of hidden items, and for a more thorough and fast check. Quantities of liquids allowed on board are limited because it is possible to make a liquid bomb, or use liquids as components for bombs, and electronics are checked for discrepancies within their inner components. Therefore, measures that are often considered excessive or humiliating are necessary for preventing terror acts or violence on board.###"}

Modern children and teenagers prefer calmer forms of entertainment, such as watching television, or in a large degree, playing video games. Although video games can contribute to a child’s development, many of them, unfortunately, are extremely violent. Moreover, games propagating murder and violence, such as Mortal Kombat, Outlast, Grand Theft Auto, and so on, are popular and are being advertised everywhere, making teenagers willing to play them; the fact that they are marked by the ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) does not help much. However, considering the nature of such games, they should not be allowed for teens to play.\n\nFor the human brain, there is no big difference between a real-life situation, and an imaginary one; this is why we get upset even if we think about something unpleasant. For children and teens, who usually have a rich imagination, everything is even more intense. Virtual experiences for them may feel as real as daily life; this happens due to advanced technologies, making computer graphics look extremely close to reality, and also because players take a first-person role in the killing process (often with the view “from a character’s eyes”). If they would passively watch a violent game, it would make less harm than acting as a character who makes progress through a plot by murdering people and destroying what is in the character’s path. This situation is negative, as a child’s or teen’s brain forms new connections every day—they actually learn and memorize what is going on in their favorite games (HuffingtonPost).\n\nMoreover, violent games directly reward violent behavior; many modern games do not simply make make players kill virtual reality characters of other players online, but also grant them with scores (experience) or points for successful acts of violence. These points are usually spent on making a player’s character even more efficient in killing, unlocking new cruel ways of murdering, and so on. Sometimes, players will be even praised directly, verbally; for example, in many online shooters, after conducting a killing, players hear phrases like “Nice shot!” encouraging further violence. This is much worse than watching TV, as TV programs do not offer a reward directly tied to the viewer’s behavior, and do not praise viewers for doing something anti-social (ITHP).\n\nAccording the American Psychological Association, violent video games increase children’s aggression. Dr. Phil McGraw explains, “The number one negative effect is they tend to inappropriately resolve anxiety by externalizing it. So when kids have anxiety, which they do, instead of soothing themselves, calming themselves, talking about it, expressing it to someone, or even expressing it emotionally by crying, they tend to externalize it. They can attack something, they can kick a wall, they can be mean to a dog or a pet.” Additionally, there’s an increased frequency of violent responses from children who play these kinds of video games (Dr.Phil.com).\n\nUnfortunately, many modern games incorporate violence. Having youth play these video games are dangerous, as teenagers and children usually take a first person role in the killing process, and even get rewarded or praised for doing so. According to numerous studies, this leads to an increase of aggression in them.###"}
{"prompt":"How does the efficiency of teamwork compare to working individually?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The world of developed capitalism in which we live in nowadays requires the constant increase of productivity. Productivity is what billions of guides, books, and training sessions are dedicated to; in order to increase it, companies regularly come up with new strategies, models of workflow organization, and so on. One of the sacred cows of modern capitalism is teamwork; for some reason, managers of all ranks believe teamwork is the ultimate component of success (or at least one of them). Team-building activities, corporate parties, group projects, hanging out with colleagues after work, and so on—all this is meant to organize productive teamwork. But, is teamwork really all that superb?\n\nUsually, people write something like this in their CVs: “Enjoy working in a team,” or “Work best in a team.” However, working in a team often means devaluing the work done. For example, if you are a lone wolf who has just accomplished a complicated project, you get all the credit, your reputation grows faster, and you get paid more. On the other hand, in a team, the credit cannot be given to someone specific; instead, a team manager usually gathers everyone in a conference room and says something like, “Good job, everyone.” This might be satisfying if you have a strong self-identification with your team, but usually this is not enough. This may lead to a decrease of personal interest and motivation in the work done. Do you want all the credit for the work done to be shared among a number of people (Silverton Internet College)?\n\nWorking in a team does not mean that all the working processes will consist of super-productive meetings, intense brainstorming, and the accurately-organized work of professionals, where everyone knows their part of the job perfectly. Usually, the efficiency of teamwork is decreased by a number of factors. Among the factors one could include are team members’ unwillingness to take responsibility, procrastination of team members, noisy surroundings, personal conflicts between team members, poor organization of progress of work, gossiping and informal communication, and so on. At the same time, when working individually, it is easier to focus on a task, without getting distracted by random chattering. Besides, individual work implies higher personal responsibility for outcomes (FRI).\n\nAnother important factor is the people’s temperament within a team. Working in a team, interacting with other people, sharing responsibilities, and spending a lot of time with coworkers is good for extroverted people. Extroverts are not necessarily always uninhibited, friendly, and communicative, but they indeed work better in groups. Since extroverted people make a majority of Earth’s population, there is no surprise that corporate culture is oriented towards them. However, introverted people are also numerous; they prefer to control the amount of their daily social interactions, to work alone, to determine the volumes of work for themselves, and think about current work issues alone. For them, teamwork is usually a curse; commonly, introverts  do their share of work, and leave all the bright ideas they have for themselves. Introverts usually do not enjoy working in teams, and a professional manager should know that they disclose their full potential only when allowed to work on their own (IFR). Therefore, a team that does not take into account the needs and qualities of introverts in it is less productive than it could be.\n\nTeamwork is important for modern companies, as it is considered to be an effective form of workflow organization. At the same time, a teamwork’s efficiency is often overestimated, due to numerous factors. Among them one should mention the lack of personal interest and motivation in doing the job; poor organization and a large number of distractions; besides, some people are not suitable for teamwork, and disclose their full potential only when working alone. Therefore, the role and efficiency of teamwork should be reevaluated.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of traveling for high school students?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" For many students in the U.S., studying in high school today is easier than, say, a hundred years ago. Indeed, due to advanced technologies which can be used for studying, being a student today is hardly a dilemma. In addition, high school students do not have to rush into choosing their future fields of expertise and entering a university; instead, they can take a gap year to relax, earn some money, and see what they would like to be doing before studying further. And in my opinion, one of the best ways to spend a gap year (at least half of it) is to travel around different countries.\n\nTravelling is not about simply having fun; in fact, it is a serious survival school, especially for a young person who got used to being taken care of by his or her parents. It does not mean a teen must cook food on an open fire or sleep in dire woods; in the 21st century, Master Card allows a person to comfortably live almost in any country of the world. By survival, I mean the necessity to make independent decisions and take responsibility for them by facing the consequences. Where to eat or what to cook; which transport is cheaper; how to buy something you need when the retailer does not speak any language you know; where to stay for the night; how to get from point A to point B—these, as well as many other questions a traveler solves every day, and there is no one around to tell them whether their decision is true or false. For a young person, the ability to make life-affecting decisions can be invaluable (TravelStudentsF).\n\nTravelling not only makes a teen more decisive, but also more communicative. When you go to a foreign country, you know almost nothing about it. Even if you have searched for some information about it, 90% of it is useless when you arrive to the new place. Therefore, you need help, and the only assistance you can get in a foreign country is from locals; in case you travel to a non-English-speaking country, you should also be prepared for the fact that people will not understand you. This can easily become an emergency case, because even basic communication phrases like “I need a doctor” or “I need help” suddenly become a challenge; therefore, a traveler has either to learn phrases of the local language, or try to explain what he or she needs with gestures. Both ways are fun, and contribute to making a person more easygoing and able to communicate with almost anyone. For a person who has lived for half a year in, for example, Nepal, communicating with English-speaking people after returning back home is easier (IFR).###"}
{"prompt":"What are the implications of overpricing digital products?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In the age of the Internet, protecting authorship and intellectual rights has become a real challenge. Numerous laws protecting intellectual rights imply only one way of protection: prohibiting any copying or usage without paying money for a digital product. Prices for digital products are often excessively high, and it encourages people to seek for free content and download it illegally. However, there is no real necessity to charge so much money for digital content, or sometimes even to pay for it at all.\n\nOne of the most famous rock bands in the world, Radiohead, had impressed their fans, critics, and the entertainment industry in 2007 with an unconventional step: they suggested that everyone could purchase their new album “In Rainbows” for as much as they could afford to pay, with the minimal price of 45 pennies (Telegraph). A free download of the album was also possible. Did the band suffer any financial inconvenience due to this act? Definitely not. On the contrary, due to such an extraordinary way of marketing, a significantly larger amount of people had purchased “In Rainbows” than was expected.\n\nThe famous band U2 in 2014 released an album titled “Songs of Innocence,” which was available for free download in iTunes. On their website, U2 posted a message explaining the rationale behind their decision: “People who haven’t heard our music, or weren’t remotely interested, might play us for the first time because we’re in their library. And for the people out there who have no interest in checking us out, look at it this way… the blood, sweat and tears of some Irish guys are in your junk mail.” Once again, the band did not suffer financial inconveniences (Pitchfork).\n\nAs for the popular claim that free downloading is stealing, it is not true. Theft means an illegal possession of a good that belongs to another person; as the result of theft, this person can not use this good anymore, and thus suffers moral and material damage. However, in the case of free downloading, the owner of a digital product (be it music, a movie, or photography) does not lose it; in a world with 7 billion people living in it (and growing), the owner will find a paying customer. It happens already; if it was not happening, retailers would have gone bankrupt several years after the Internet had been invented (FRI). Besides, people had been sharing content long before the Internet appeared, but according to the logic of copyright protectors, if I give my friend a book to read—for free—then my friend is a pirate, because he did not pay for this book, and its author suffers greatly. This is ridiculous.\n\nThe prices for digital products on the Internet are greatly overpriced; many artists such as Radiohead and U2 already allow their fans to purchase their music for the lowest possible prices, or to download it for free. Besides, free downloading is not theft, because retailers do not lose the goods they are selling, and there are paying customers willing to buy products. Therefore, copyright laws, as well as prices of digital products, should be revised.###"}
{"prompt":"How does having a sense of humor help people deal with stress?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" “Stress coping strategies,” or “how to deal with excessive stress,” and other similar phrases are among the most popular Google search inquiries in the U.S. Indeed, the common American citizen faces a huge amount of stressful events, starting from fees and taxes and ending up with career issues, divorce, or the death of relatives. And although antidepressant medicine is extremely developed and popular in the U.S., there is an effective, safe, and free way to cope with stress. This is having a strong sense of humor.\n\nSpecialists around the world have noticed that people with a strong sense of humor tend to be happier, and deal with stress better than those who take negative events close to their hearts or ruminate about them. Having a strong sense of humor does not mean their jokes are always funny, however; it means they try to find the positive or funny side in their misfortunes, or at least do not react negatively (FRI Online). Therefore, a sense of humor can directly influence how a person feels, in terms of both mind and body.\n\nScientists claim that a sense of humor has both short-term and long-term positive effects on our bodies and minds. For example, in a short-term perspective, a sense of humor can stimulate your internal organs (due to fresh oxygen-rich air which you inhale when you laugh), such as the heart, lungs, and muscles, and free you from some physical effects of stress; when you laugh, your blood circulates faster, and different groups of muscles relax, which results in a better mood. Long-term effects include the strengthening of your immune system, improving your overall mood and satisfaction with life and yourself, and even pain relieve; laughter is known to be able to break the pain-spasm cycle common to some muscle disorders (MayoClinic).\n\nTo those who think a person either has a sense of humor or does not, you can develop your sense of humor through working on it. If you work on it, it will become an even more effective anti-stress weapon for you than just being humorous from birth. This is illustrated with the following experiment that took place. Two groups of senior citizens allocated in different retirement centers were given special tasks to accomplish during eight weeks. The first group needed to perform a number of activities designed to build their humor skills; the second group during all this time gathered to watch comedies every night. At the end of the experiment, it turned out that the first group that was actively working on humor skills was not just coping better with the stress, but also used humor as a coping tool more often and more effectively than ever before.\n\nIn the modern world, where stressful events happen every day, it is important to have a tool that can help us cope with inner friction. A sense of humor is exactly this kind of tool—it is free and effective. Studies show that a sense of humor helps people treat their misfortunes with more ease; moreover, humor and laughter causes a row of positive short and long-term effects on people’s minds and bodies. It is important to know you can develop your humor skills through actively working on them; in this case, it will become an extremely effective tool in the matter of dealing with stress.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of allowing employees to work from home?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The Internet has forever changed the lives of human beings globally. Not only has it connected people all over the planet with each other and changed communication, but it also affected the usual way and regime of work, as well as created new forms of employment, such as freelancing. Although the Internet allows employees to efficiently work outside of the office, many companies still prohibit such a practice. Allowing employees to work from home should be practiced on a wider basis due to a number of significant reasons.\n\nTo allow employees to work from home means to balance the eternal “work-family” scales. According to a Penn State study, being able to work outside of the office (at home, mostly) helps to avoid typical conflict situations that arise when a person cannot spend enough time with their family. Besides, working from home relieves an employee of the daily stress connected to the necessity to get to their office regardless of health conditions, weather, family circumstances, and so on (Salary.com).\n\nAccording to the Work Without Walls survey, among the benefits connected to working from home are the following: a less stressful environment (38%), a quieter atmosphere (43%), an elimination of a long commute (44%), less distractions (44%), increased productivity (45%), saving money on gas (55%), and a great work\/home balance (60%). At the same time, according to the survey, the lack of control and the inability to see results of work in practice may negatively affect productivity of those employees who work from home (Forbes).\n\nWorking from home generally improves employees’ satisfaction with their lives and workplace; reduces attrition and the number of unscheduled absences due to poor health conditions and other reasons; increases productivity due to fewer distracting factors, more comfortable working conditions; saves employer’s (and employee’s) money and minimizes chances of workplace discrimination; provides employees with opportunities for underemployment, and so on (Globalworkplaceanalytics.com).\n\nThe Internet allows millions of employees whose duties do not require them to be present in the office to work from home. Although many employers do not seem to be enthusiastic about letting their employees work from home, this practice is in many ways beneficial for both the employer and the worker. In particular, working from home allows employees to successfully maintain a work-family balance; an increased level of productivity, decreased stress, less discrimination, economy, and opportunities for freelancing and underemployment are among the most frequently named benefits of working from home. Therefore, employers should consider enabling this practice more often.###"}
{"prompt":"How can we set our priorities straight when it comes to spending money on major sports?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Why do professional sportsmen and sportswomen garner millions of dollars by shooting a ball into a net, for instance? Many other examples can be provided of such almost senseless sports activities that have somehow formed a lucrative empire of “entertainment.” While people around the world are starving to death due to a lack of food, health care, and shelter, other people are watching famous sports personalities score goals and points. When considering the suffering globally resulting from a lack of funds, spending money on sporting events seems like a rather misguided purchase.\n\nTake the figures: in 2013 alone, 33.7 billion dollars were spent on major sporting events globally. That means in only one year, the amount spent on major sporting event tickets would be enough to rebuild the infrastructure of the recently demolished Gaza Strip and feed its inhabitants three meals a day for seven months (Forques Magazine). We need to set our priorities straight—what is more important to us: seeing our favorite teams compete and the culture surrounding that competition, or saving the lives of those that are terribly affected by ravishing war?\n\nBut it seems we cherish entertainment and sports culture more than helping out those that are dying in the streets each day. The Edmonds Daily Newspaper published an article on the obsession of sports in the U.S. that was informative: on average, a U.S. citizen spends an accumulated three hours watching sports news coverage each month, and purchases 1.2 tickets to major sporting events every three months (Edmonds Daily Newspaper). What if we used these hours and purchases for the benefit of others that are in a life-or-death situation daily?\n\nThe amount of money spent on major sports clothing and souvenirs is also alarming. In a study by Sarvend University in Minnesota, it was found that every world citizen on average spends $7.4 a year on sporting goods, whether it be clothing related to teams, sports equipment with markings of professional sports team symbols, sports gaming cards, sports gambling, or video games that portray their favorite teams in action (Opus, 311). The amount of money spent on sports fan accessories could be directed towards much more holistic causes, benefiting those who fear for their lives each day.\n\nWith the excessive amount of money spent on major sporting tickets, the amount of time we spend on watching major sports events, and the amount of money spent of sports fan accessories, we give too much attention to major sports. In our world, our country, our state, and even our city, there are countless individuals who cannot afford housing, food, and other basic necessities. Instead of handing out our money to the huge business of major sports and products associated with major sports, we could use our purchasing power for causes that would save people’s lives. Channeling billions of dollars into major sports is not logical when we have a world ravaged by suffering.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of plastic surgery?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is not a secret that the standards of beauty nowadays are rather strict and demanding. No matter what combatants against discrimination say, appearances that match the existing beauty standards remain one of the crucial characteristics of a modern individual. People who are discontent with their appearances have different ways of improving the way they look, such as makeup, clothes, or being in harmony with themselves. However, there is a more radical alternative, which is effective in terms of changing the way a person looks like, but is highly debated and should be abstained from in the majority of cases: plastic surgery.\n\nThe foremost reason for not getting plastic surgery is that this procedure can become highly addictive (Huffington Post). Although a person might think they would do a single improvement, the temptation to keep “adjusting” one’s appearance can become overwhelming and lead to unpredictable and often sad results. The best examples of this are women like Cindy Jackson (who got 55 plastic surgeries, which is a world record), or Jocelyn Wildenstein, who is rumored to have spent about 4 million dollars on plastic surgeries. The “before and after” photos of her can be found online easily, so you can make your conclusions looking at the results of the numerous plastic surgeries she has undergone. Janice Dickinson, Michael Jackson, Courtney Love, and other famous personalities who had undergone plastic surgeries can also be good examples of why this kind of surgery should be abstained from.\n\nPlastic surgery does not solve the main problem of the person who decides to undergo it, which is being discontent with his or her appearance. Such a person should rather focus on solving his or her inner problems, and should pay more attention to what is going on within themselves rather than on the surface of their bodies (MindBodyGreen). In the case of an aging person, it might be the fear of death or the feeling that they do not have a youthful appearance anymore that causes them to change their appearance. If a person is obese, they should consider changing their diet and lifestyle rather than doing a liposuction. There is also a serious psychological disorder called dysmorphophobia—the major symptom is being severely unsatisfied with one’s appearance, body parts, or body as a whole. Anyways, visiting a psychologist or a psychotherapist could be more useful and satisfying than having your face redesigned.\n\nIt is important to remember that plastic surgery is something that remains with you forever (dbreath.com). You cannot return to your natural look if you feel discontent with the surgery. You will have to do another surgery to look similar to your original self, or try to improve on your previous plastic surgery. Moreover, if you try to keep up with fashion trends, you will lose the race, because trends change, and your appearance remains. What is natural is almost always better than the artificial, and deep inside you will know that the way you used to look before the surgery was better. However, it is necessary to distinguish between cosmetic and reconstructive surgery. In case of accidents, when a person’s appearance is ruined, reconstructive surgery is indeed necessary and helpful.\n\nPlastic surgery in its cosmetic aspect should be abstained from. Changing and improving one’s appearance can become addictive, so a person might feel a constant desire to undergo surgeries; also, this desire is usually caused by issues with well-being, which a psychologist could help out with better than a surgeon. You cannot undo plastic surgery, so once you undergo it, you will have to live with it forever. Be yourself, and see the beauty you hold naturally.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages of Android-based devices over Apple products?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The recent hysteria about iPhone 6 and the new iOS is natural. Every several years, Apple announces new gadgets that promise to be better than those of the previous generation. In fact, changes are rather insignificant, because both older and newer gadgets are equally decent to deal with any tasks common users would want to accomplish. So, there are many people who prefer the alternative paradigm in the world of mobile technologies, and choose gadgets that work on an Android OS, developed by Google. There are several solid reasons why gadgets on Android are better than those produced by Apple.\n\nPrimarily, it is about customization. Being the user of an Android device allows you to customize literally everything, starting from how your operating system looks like (with various unofficial mods) and ending up with third-party software (such as keyboards, widgets, and so on), which is in many cases more advanced and functional than standard Android applications. Moreover, Android users can access advanced functions of their gadgets through the procedure of rooting, which allows them to use their smartphones at 100%. At the same time, Apple devices do not grant their users with wide customization possibilities (What Culture).\n\nAnother reason for giving preference to Android is this operating system lets its users manipulate multimedia files much easier than Apple devices. In fact, if you are an Android user, you can simply drag-and-drop your files into the device’s folder (which is another Android’s advantage), whereas Apple products want you to manage your music with iTunes, and your photos with iPhotos (Business Insider). In general, working with files on Android is also easier, because Google, unlike Apple, grants users access to a device’s filing system.\n\nPricing is, perhaps, the major reason for choosing Android. If you know for sure what you want from your smartphone or tablet, you can easily find a device that suits your needs without paying more money for unneeded features like advanced CPU, RAM, and so on (Android Authority). Also, applications for Android are cheaper than for iOS, and many of them are free. So, Android-based devices can help their users save money. Besides, Android devices work great with Google services, such as Disk, Docs, or Maps, and so on.\n\nOn the whole, Android OS and devices based on it are a better choice than Apple products, due to being more flexible. It allows wider possibilities for customization, an easier management of files, and is in general cheaper than iOS. All the hype for the iPhone might as well be well-orchestrated marketing propaganda.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages and disadvantages of Instagram?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In a world where digital products have more and more effect on people’s daily lives, certain software and media products inevitably become the center of the public’s attention. Moreover, they become a part of an individual’s lifestyle. Along with Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, which already are daily companions for millions of people, there is one more application that causes debates and conflicting assessments: Instagram. Though it has many opponents, Instagram is in fact a useful program helping people develop their creativity and learn about culture.\n\nAs with any other digital product, Instagram can be used ineptly. Billions of boring and similar selfies, kittens, flowers, “Converse” sneakers, and food photos have become the subject for ridicule. However, what Instagram critics miss is its usage among a vast population of creative people.\n\nFor instance, many famous photographers, whose talent is undisputed, use Instagram to share their photos taken on their phones. Such photographers as Richard Koci Hernandez (@koci), Cory Richards (@coryrichards), Michael O’Neal (@moneal), and Jimmy Chin (@jimmy_chin) are real professionals. For instance, Jimmy Chin and Cory Richards are photographers for National Geographic. And there are many more professional photographers on Instagram. This means any person possessing a smartphone can follow their accounts, and receive daily high quality images. It is like a first-hand workshop, direct lessons on photography, and denying this advantage of Instagram is not reasonable.\n\nOne of the biggest pluses of Instagram is its mobility. In the 21st century, a smartphone is a thing almost nobody leaves at his or her home. Considering nearly every smartphone has a camera, every time one walks around the city, one has a tool to capture the most interesting and inspiring moments, and what is more important, receive momentary feedback. “Likes” are not a truly adequate assessment of your creativity, but if you are followed by famous (or talented) photographers, and they like your photos, it can be a hint you are moving in the right direction.\n\nInstagram has its own advantages not only for creative people, but also for businesses. In fact, it is a great platform for what is called visual marketing, when you have an ability to introduce your products to potential customers directly (i.e. visually) in the most attractive way. One can form a whole feed of marketing images, encouraging interaction and purchasing (MaximizeSocialBusiness). In addition, promoting accounts in Instagram is not difficult, so gaining a number of followers and potential customers is not a big deal.\n\nInstagram is not all about advantages, though. There are many people who post mediocre, or even bad photos, hoping to get more likes; obsession with shooting selfies has officially become a psychological disorder (CE), and the amount of people with bad taste in photography can be depressing. However, if used responsibly and with a purpose, Instagram can be a useful tool.\n\nRegardless of its disadvantages, Instagram remains a useful and fun tool for both amateur and professional photographers. It allows common people to follow famous photographers and learn from their works. It also allows users to receive feedback about their creativity. In addition, Instagram can be an effective media platform for businesses, allowing companies to use visual marketing to engage customers.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of the glamorous lifestyle promoted by glossy magazines?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One of the dominant segments of media today is entertainment, not only in terms of content, but also as the main principle of establishing, functioning, and providing information. In its turn, in this sphere of entertainment, glossy magazines for both men and women occupy a significant place; they are dedicated to a great diversity of topics, but most of all, they are focused on the glamorous lifestyle they expect their readership to adhere to. Though these magazines are supposedly for entertainment, they still have a significant impact on the minds of the people who read them, be it adults or teenagers with forming personalities. And unfortunately, claims about the negative influence of this kind of information are heard more often, and are more reasonable than those offered by the advocates of the glamorous lifestyle.\n\nTo start with, glamorous magazines propagate rather debated values. In particular, the most obvious danger is the body image promoted by celebrities. Eating disorders, such as anorexia, are known all over the world; psychologists connect it to the desire of young people to have “ideal” figures possessed by people whom they usually see in glossy magazines, and whom they believe to be fashionable or prestigious. About 69% of young people aged 9-18 perceive models’ figures they see in magazines as ideal bodies (Commonplace). Rather often, people see hunger as the shortest way to become slim, and through this, they develop a neurosis known as anorexia. Its results are dramatic and familiar around the world: teenagers and adults die of exhaustion, or undergo serious and difficult rehab procedures. Is it worth looking “glamorous?” Not at all.\n\nThe glamorous lifestyle propagated by such personalities as Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian, and other celebrities one can see in tabloids is impossible to achieve without narcissism. In fact, today we are witnessing the rise of a more narcissistic world culture. Self-expression had been substituted by the enormous craving for recognition and for admiring attention. To gain this, a person whose personality has been affected by glossy propaganda acts dysfunctionally, but in full accordance with their understanding of what is glamorous or stylish. Though glamour is often associated with a prosperous life, people who crave it are more prone to alcohol and drug addictions, public emotional meltdowns, broken relationships, and other scandalous repercussions (The Good News). Hence, glossy magazines and glamorous propaganda change the way people think and behave in a negative way.\n\nYet another problem connected to the glamorous lifestyle is a lack of money. Entertaining magazines advertise a vast amount of expensive and prestigious items, such as jewelry, electronic gadgets, vehicles, clothes, and other luxurious products. Since glamour and consumption usually go hand in hand, a person who desires to lead a glamorous lifestyle usually feels obliged to purchase these items, even being financially incapable to do so (PhilCom). Banking loans spent totally on luxury items are no longer fiction. Vast amounts of money are spent by such people on products that will be out of fashion in no time; and whereas celebrities can afford changing prestigious accessories whenever they wish, for common people, changes in fashion usually mean new loans.\n\nThe glamorous lifestyle is commonly associated with a life full of pleasure and enjoyment; however, it has another side, which is not as attractive and shiny. Inappropriate body image concepts lead to a development of anorexia among teenagers and adults who want to look like models they see in magazines. Narcissism, cultivated by glamorous propaganda, usually leads to dysfunctional behavior and various kinds of addictions. Besides, being “glamorous” is rather expensive. Hence, adhering to a glamorous lifestyle is not something to strive for.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of transhumanism?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" By the first quarter of the 21st century, humankind’s evolution has reached its peak; at least this is true for the human brain, as some neuroscientists claim (io9). This means the shape of our bodies, as well as the functions of our organs, and our mental capabilities, will most likely not change in the future. However, a large group of people believe the human race can be enhanced by the means of modern technology; along with reasonable ideas, there exist radical theories about digital immortality (uploading one’s consciousness to external storage), or replacing human biological bodies with cloned or mechanical ones. This ideology is called transhumanism, and despite its seeming attractiveness, it is a dangerous idea and a direct way to social instability and losing humaneness.\n\nLet us focus on the transhumanist idea about shifting our natural bodies to artificial ones. No matter how sophisticated the technology is, it cannot overcome one of the most amazing mechanisms that have ever existed: human emotions. Simply put, an emotion is a reaction of an individual’s body to their thoughts or actions. One does not feel an emotion in their mind—it is a physical reflection of their mental condition. However, if the human body is replaced by a mechanical analogue, how would this person be able to have feelings? Emotions serve as regulators of our behavior. Shame, guilt, compassion, fear, joy—these and many other emotions we feel every day; they help us distinguish rights from wrongs, they empower our ethics, our moral norms (FAKE 1). Even if a cloned biological body would be used instead of the mechanical one, where are the guarantees that nothing would go wrong? Emotionality is perhaps one of the strongest anchors of humaneness that we possess, and denying it would most likely lead to unforeseen consequences.\n\nAnother problem related to transhumanism is a global shift in social processes. Since transhumanism implies a person voluntarily undergoing bodily changes, it is obvious that respective procedures will be available only to those who can afford paying money for it (as it will not be cheap). At the same time, artificial enhancements will most likely make these new human beings more effective in terms of mental and physical capabilities; hence, they might be able to form a sort of a higher caste that would treat regular “non-augmented” humans as inferior beings (Anselmo). Crimes, discrimination, human rights infringement, and other negative consequences of this artificial and uncontrolled evolution are directly connected to the previous thesis about the loss of emotions, and seems to be inevitable.\n\nOne of the scourges of human civilization of the 21st century are mental diseases. Many of us know people with Alzheimer’s disease at 60 or 70 years old. Paranoia, schizophrenia, all kinds of obsessive-compulsive disorders, Alzheimer, dementia, and many other mental dysfunctions are rather common within an average lifespan of 70-80 years. However, transhumanists believe the ability to transfer minds to the external storage would make people immortal. But our minds are biologically programmed to function within a certain time lapse (ScientificBase). It can be compared to an expiration date, and the more time passes after it, the worse the mind’s condition is. Considering this, would an immortal entity be able to remain fully sane for hundreds of years? A mental disease is not a virus or glitch, so one cannot start an anti-viral program to delete it. Hence, some kind of a cyber-psychotherapy would become medical discipline number one in the transhumanist future. It is ironic: transhumanists like Ray Kurzweil or Hans Moravec dream of godlike abilities, but instead of creating digital universes, humans in fact would have to fight idiocy and mental disorders.\n\nTranshumanism as an ideology of the artificial evolution of humankind by the means of technology can be rather attractive. Some transhumanist ideas could be even applied for the sake of humanity. On the other hand, radical transhumanist ideas—transferring the human mind to artificial external carriers, in particular—are dystopic. Artificial or cloned bodies would cause “augmented” human beings a number of severe problems; for example, people would lose their ability to feel emotions, which is one of the key criteria of humaneness. Social life would change drastically, as augmented people would most likely treat “simple” people as inferior beings. But most likely, the minds of such augmented and immortal people would collapse, because a human mind has a biologically-programmed “expiration date.” Therefore, transhumanism and its ideals are hardly applicable to humanity.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the consequences of lowering the drinking age?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Alcohol belongs in the category of psychoactive substances one can legally buy in almost any country, according to certain criteria. Most often, this criteria is age; in the majority of cases, it is set to 21 years. However, in a number of countries, such as Australia, China, and Russia, it is set to 18 (ICAP). In the United states, calls for lowering the drinking age have sounded for a rather long time; considering that alcohol can lead to unpredictable behavior and other negative social consequences, the drinking age should not be lowered.\n\nOne of the first associations that come to mind when talking about alcohol is driving. For citizens of the United States, having a car is seen as a must starting from the age when a teenager is allowed to receive a driving license. According to data provided by the organization Mothers Against Drunk Driving, in 2010, a high percentage of car accidents connected to drunk driving (15.1% out of 10.228 individuals) was observed among young people aged between 18-20 years (PolicyMic). Respectively, if youths were officially allowed to consume alcohol from 18 years old, this index of car accidents would necessarily be much higher. Moreover, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration claims that since establishing the drinking age of 21 in 1975, the number of car fatalities among 18-20 year old drivers in the United States decreased by 13% (SFGate).\n\nThe medical irresponsibility of allowing teenagers to drink alcohol on a legal basis is also obvious to those who have at least a basic knowledge in biology. Consuming alcohol on a regular basis can negatively affect the development of an individual’s brain’s frontal lobes, which are responsible for emotional regulation, as well as for planning and organization (ProCon.org). Underage individuals who consume alcohol put themselves at more risk of addiction, decreased ability of decision-making, tend to behave less responsibly, and may become violent, depressed, and even prone to suicide.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of paternity leave?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Maternity is known to be both a challenging and joyful condition for, perhaps, the majority of women. Governments worldwide commonly support young mothers by providing them with paid vacations, or maternity leave from work. Though in the United States it is not paid, in a number of countries such as Australia or the Czech Republic, mothers receive payments in the amount of 100% of their wages. At the same time, women after childbirth require as much attention as newborns, and this is when men are most needed. Young fathers would also like to have free time to dedicate to their families and especially children. However, typically, governments provide men with a short paternity leave or none at all. This is a drawback of national healthcare policies that should be eliminated.\n\nUnlike maternity leave, paid vacations provided for young fathers are dramatically shorter. For example, in Saudi Arabia, fathers are allowed to take only one paid day off; in Kenya, this term is two weeks, and in Iceland, three months (CNN). In the United States, fathers can take such a leave, but they will be deprived of being paid their wages during this period.\n\nThis is rather unfair, since it is valuable and beneficial for families that men have an opportunity to take a vacation at crucial times without having to worry about losing their job. It is stated that divorces in families where men could take a paternity leave occurred seldom compared to families where men continued to work even after a child was born (Adecco). Men have more time and opportunities to focus on their wives and children without any thoughts about work in the background, and thus paternity leave is one of the factors that help to develop and maintain long-lasting family relationships.\n\nAccording to data gathered after studies conducted in Australia, Great Britain, United States, and Denmark, fathers who choose to take a paternity leave from work immediately after a child is born tend to engage into child-caring activities more regularly, and their children display better cognitive development and school readiness in their early years (The Age National). “Father’s leave is linked to more involvement in childcare activities such as helping a baby to eat, changing nappies, getting up in the night, bathing and reading to a child, compared to fathers who took no leave. There was some evidence of children having better cognitive outcomes when fathers were more involved early on in their lives,” says Dr. Jennifer Baxter, the author of the study.\n\nIt may seem to be an indirect argument, but paid paternity leaves contribute to economies as well. First of all, it helps women return to their workplaces at a quicker rate; secondly, paternity leave strengthens family relationships and makes people happier—stated succinctly, for companies, happy families mean happy employees. This results in an increase of productivity and loyalty to a company.\n\nUnlike maternity leave, the terms of paid paternity vacations connected to childbirth are shorter; in some countries, such as the United States, young fathers have to take paternity leaves at their own risk, as it is often the case that such vacations will be unpaid; it is no surprise that many employees decide not to take such vacations. At the same time, paternity leaves can lead to numerous positive results. Among them one can distinguish the decrease of divorce rates and a contribution to maintaining balanced family relationships; fathers’ regular involvement in child-caring activities that result into children’s better cognitive development; also, a contribution to economies, as paternity leaves allow women to recover and return to work faster, and make employees happier, and thus more productive and loyal to companies.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of state lotteries?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Treasure hunting is, perhaps, one of the most thrilling experiences. Thorough historical research, careful planning, logistics, gathering a team, and excavations can result either in brilliant success, or colossal failure. History knows thousands of examples of both; moreover, mass insanity on this basis has not been rare. For an example, it is enough to take a look at the Gold Rush in the United States, myths about Eldorado, and so on. In the 20th century, it has gained a more civilized manifestation in the form of state lotteries. And though lotteries can make a few people rich, in fact they can inflict serious damage both to a state’s economy and to one’s personality.\n\nThe first and foremost reason against state lotteries is that they harm national economies. For example, in the United States, only in the year 2009, more than $50 billion was spent to print state lottery tickets, set video kiosks, and on other preparations. From this total, in 2010, the most part of this money was wasted on the commissions for stores selling these tickets and prizes; the government received only $17.9 billion, which broke down to 30 percent in profits and 8 percent in administrative costs (Salon). In addition, lotteries can be seen as a hidden form of taxing; in 2009, 11 American state lotteries raised more money per person than corporate income taxes (Johnston).\n\nThough people usually tend to see lotteries as a panacea against their unsatisfactory financial condition, in fact, lotteries cannot save one from poverty or going bankrupt. In 2007, one out three lottery winners experienced severe financial problems within about five years, and even lost all their capital (Consumerist). One of the main reasons standing behind this phenomenon is that despite suddenly gaining vast amounts of money, people do not revise their financial habits; moreover, rather often lottery winners spend money less carefully than they used to do before winning.\n\nIn addition, participating in lotteries may quickly become a form of gambling addiction. Gambling implies playing a game that has uncertain outcomes with an intention to win or lose capital (financial, property, and so on). A lottery, by all means, is a game of uncertain outcomes, in which its participants win prizes or lose money (Phil For Humanity). Both can become an addiction, which can manifest itself in a desire of an immediate recoup after losing, regular bidding, or in terminal cases, even mortgaging property and taking huge loans to pay for the addiction.\n\nLotteries, despite their seeming safety and innocence, are treacherous and dangerous. They are harmful for national economies and is a hidden form of tax, which even poor people pay eagerly in their hope to get rich in no time. Lotteries contribute to people going bankrupt within about five years after winning, because people usually do not change their financial habits and tend to spend the suddenly-awarded money carelessly. Besides, lotteries can be seen as a form of gambling, and thus participating in lotteries can easily become a potent addiction. Therefore, lotteries can hardly be considered a beneficial affair.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of taking a gap year?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The choice of a future career is, perhaps, among the most important decisions an individual makes throughout his or her life. Even though a profession may change with the flow of time, making the first step on this path is an essential act. And despite the fact a particular college or university will not necessarily design and determine their future, for many it is true. Assuming a student is left to decide what they want to become on their own terms, and that nobody should interfere in his or her decision-making process, a necessity to select a college—which equals making a fateful decision—requires deep analysis and contemplation. Therefore, taking a gap year after graduating from high school is a reasonable alternative for students who are not yet sure about their goals, dreams, and expectations for the future.\n\nPerhaps the first factor speaking in favor of taking a gap year is that by doing so, a student learns responsibility and how to organize his or her life to a greater extent. Taking a gap year is expensive in terms of travelling (which is one of the main occupations of students during their gap years) or spending free time in some other way. When students realize this simple fact, they usually get temporary part-time jobs to cover the expenditures of future vacations (WhateverResources). They can also collect money for further education to decrease the amount of student loans that they need to take out. All this makes students more self-sufficient and responsible for their decisions, the way they spend money, and organize their time.\n\nThe other significant reason for taking a gap year is better academic performance. Whereas many students and their parents are concerned about possible problems with academic performance after taking a year off, recent research proves the opposite. In particular, studies show that students who decide to take a gap year before entering a college had a GPA that was on average 0.1-0.4 higher than those students who enrolled into higher education immediately after high school (FoxBusiness). Researchers believe it is connected to the possibility to choose one’s sphere of interests, and make a more balanced and reasonable decision before choosing what to major in. In addition, another reason why the second category of students often may perform worse is fatigue from studying at high school; those who take a gap year do not experience this problem.\n\nTaking a year off is also a perfect opportunity to see the world and feel completely free of daily routines, troubles, and assignments—students are able make new friends around the world, find inspiration, and dedicate time to introspect about their own behavior. To some degree, this chance is the only one a person may have throughout their his or her life, because in the future awaits all kinds of academic assignments, career choices, family, and other manifestations of life in higher education (Mihaylova). Many students choose to visit countries they know they will never go to in the future; this often provides them with inspiration, different perspectives, broadens their outlooks, and helps them to understand the diversity of the world they live in on a deeper level.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the reasons why torture should not be tolerated?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hollywood movies usually show villains, terrorists, and criminals as totally corrupt and negative characters, where main protagonists usually murder “in the name of justice.” Perhaps, considering the amount of damage a victim (or their relatives) might have suffered from hostile actions, simply placing an offender under custody (with further imprisonment) does not look an adequate penalty in a number of cases. In connection to this, some people raise questions about the expediency of using the death penalty or torture as a punishment for severe crimes. And while capital punishment is a norm in a number of American states (as well as in countries around the world), the propriety of tortures is a much more debated question.\n\nToday, torture is rightly seen as a medieval and inhumane way of treating a human being, regardless of its origin, social status, or any crimes committed. A number of influential treaties prohibit the use of torture. For example, article 3:1(a) of the Geneva Conventions restrict the use of “violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture” (Securing Liberty). Article 5 of The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights claims that, “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” The same message is declared in The United Nations Convention Against Torture, and the Rome Stature of the International Criminal Court. Therefore, on a legislative level, the use of torture is not acceptable.\n\nOne of the basic factors of citizens’ trust in the country they live is their confidence in the fairness of the judicial system, which guarantees the propriety of crime and punishment (Koen). In the United States, for example, it is guaranteed by the 8th Amendment of the Constitution. However, accepting torture as, for example, a method of interrogation, means citizens can no longer feel safe if they have to deal with justice, even (and especially) if they are innocent. In this case, an investigative error and the following suspicion of an innocent person can result into the application of severe psychological and physical damage to this individual before their innocence becomes evident. Respectively, to stop the torture, the innocent victim will eagerly invent any ‘evidence’ their interrogators require.\n\nProponents of torture, who insist on the propriety of the use of torture in “special cases”—for example, against serial killers, or terrorists—possibly are not aware of torture gradually becoming a normalized practice; Amnesty International uses the term “torture culture,” and claims it emerges across the chain of command (Amnesty TV). Thus, Pakistan\\Bosnian insurgent and terrorist Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times during his interrogation by the CIA; in an Iraqi prison, Abu Ghraib, low-ranking soldiers were tortured in grotesque ways for sport. Examples are numerous, but they illustrate one fact: if torture is accepted even for “special occasions,” it gradually becomes a normal practice.\n\nTorture in the modern world is a relic of the distant past. Though there are many proponents, claiming that torture is acceptable in a number of certain cases—such as against terrorists or maniacs—I believe they should not be tolerated due to several reasons. Torture is illegal: international laws prohibit the use of torture against anybody. The country that approves torture also risks to lose the trust of its citizens in itself and its judicial system. In addition, torture that is officially approved at least once tends to become a regular practice. There is no such thing as a “special occasion” when it comes to torturing.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the signs that America is slowly transforming into a third world country?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" America has been considered to be a country with one of the highest life standards in the world. Not only in the US, but globally people know the expression, “The American Dream,” and though each individual puts their own meaning in this phrase, America has been invariably associated with prosperity and wealth. Thousands of immigrants have looked for happiness on its shores. In the 20th century, the US had become one of the two most powerful countries in the world; after the collapse of the USSR, America managed to keep its dominating position. However, it did not last for long; nowadays, more and more researchers claim America is gradually transforming into a third world country.\n\nThe foremost argument in favor of the aforementioned thesis is the increasing rates of poverty. According to World Affairs, in 2009, the US counted 43.6 million citizens as officially poor; moreover, over 19 million Americans were classified as extremely poor, which implies they could hardly (or could not at all) find the financial sources to sustain their living (World Affairs). In practice, it also means the shrinking of the middle class; the sustainability of the middle class is traditionally considered to be the basis of any economically-prosperous society.\n\nDuring the recent presidential debate season, the average income level for a family to be considered middle class equaled $250,000 a year; however, according to statistics, only 1.5% of families make it up to $250,000 or higher. Less than 15% of families earn at least $100,000 a year (Alex Jones’ Infowars).\n\nAnother symptom of America’s transformation into a third world country is the gradual decrease of national industry. Since the end of the 18th century, American industry was under governmental protection, which greatly contributed into the establishment of a well-paid, qualified middle class. However, as the world became more globalized, the shield of protectionism has weakened. In the 1960s, each third American worked in manufacturing, earning a high salary for that; at the same time, over 50,000 factories were closed in the US only during the recent decade, and over five million manufacturing jobs have been lost (AlterNet). American industry slowly but persistently moves to low-wage regions of the world, such as China, India, Latin America, or certain countries of Eastern Europe, where people are ready to work in difficult conditions and for a lower payment.\n\nFrom year to year, America is becoming more economically dependent. In 2010, the US had 4.4 trillion dollars (out of 14 trillion dollars) of their debt held by the foreign governments (World Affairs). From this sum, almost a quarter ($892 billion) belongs to China. To compare, Ecuador and Iran have only about $13.5 billion of external debt each. In addition, America’s currency is not supported by a gold reserve. In practice, this means America has no other ways of paying out its debts except by emitting more dollars that have no real value.\n\nThough for many generations America was a beautiful dream, a land of opportunities and economic prosperity, recent trends do not speak in favor of such statements. On the contrary, certain signs may serve as milestones pointing to the fact that the US is slowly transforming into a third world country. Among such signs one can distinguish increasing levels of poverty and the shrinking of the middle class; the gradual decrease of national industry; and the growing external debt which makes America vulnerable and dependent on other countries.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the reasons for and against prohibiting cellphones in schools?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Today, almost any parent can use a cellphone to ask their children about their whereabouts, occupation, or health. At the same time, most parents can remember the days when cellphones did not exist, and children were factually left on their own for at least half of the day. I believe cellphones today pose a great distraction for students—especially higher-end smartphones that provide numerous opportunities for entertainment—and thus should be prohibited from use in schools; but at the same time, I stand for not prohibiting cellphones from students’ possession entirely, since they allow parents to monitor their children’s safety.\n\nThe first and foremost reason why cellphones should be prohibited from use in schools is that they pose a significant disruption in the educational process (School Security). The most obvious manifestation of such disruption is cheating during exams or other tests: access to the Internet, electronic books, and consulting with peers through mobile Skype right from the classroom. Phone rings, incoming message signals, and\/or games interfere with the educational process by distracting teachers and students from classes. Even if the sound is turned off, a phone’s vibration still distracts students.\n\nAnother reason for prohibiting cellphones in classes is an increased temptation for students to communicate with friends instead of focusing on study material. Once again, the level of technology allows clever smartphone owners to regularly check their social network profiles and browse Internet content. Texting itself, while being an extremely popular way of mobile communication among youth, becomes even more tempting when a student is listening to a lecture but has their mind wandering (Wundermuller).\n\nOne of the strange phenomenons of using cellphones in schools is cyber bullying. Cellphone cameras are being used more and more often to record and spread inappropriate images, such as photographs of students in restrooms; images of the insides of students’ lockers; videos of real and staged fights between students, as well as the recordings of the humiliation of unpopular students, and so on (District Administration). In addition, there were cases when cheap prepaid “throwaway” phones were used by students for bomb threats.\n\nAt the same time, children are safer when their parents or any other guardian are in the reach of one phone call. Therefore, to my mind, school policies should allow the possession of cellphones, but their in-class use should be prohibited. Cellphones could be left in lockers, or required to remain turned off during the entirety of school class time.\n\nThough cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use during classes. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; in addition, cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyberbullying.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the three main reasons why students should not be forced to wear uniforms in school?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One of the most significant issues for modern schools is the question of the appearance of students. Whereas children would most likely enjoy dressing the way they want, teachers and educational authorities tend towards seeing students wearing standardized uniforms. There are many opponents and proponents of an obligatory enabling of school uniforms, both coming up with reasonable arguments in favor of their claims. However, to my mind, students should not be forced to wear uniforms, as it can negatively affect their personalities.\n\nWearing school uniforms is a significant obstacle for a child’s self-expression. It is not a secret that children are much more artistic than most adults; besides, in high school, teenagers often experience an increased need to be unique and special. The clothes one wears is one of the most available means of self-expression, and school uniforms do not allow students to demonstrate their individuality. Research shows that students who were forced to wear school uniforms were more likely to use makeup earlier than their peers, and later, to use more extreme accessories to alter their fashion (short skirts, mohawks, piercing, and so on) (WiseGEEK).\n\nAnother serious reason not to make students wear uniforms is when children look different and express different outlooks, it encourages them to be tolerant to those who differ from them, and to accept alternative lifestyles (Examiner.com). This is especially important considering one country can be inhabited by the representatives of different cultures, religions, and so on. Therefore, allowing students to dress according to their liking will encourage them to tolerate and accept people of other cultural, social, and religious groups. At the same time, a forced introduction of school uniforms results in a loss of diversity and a lack of tolerance towards strangers and people who are different from the majority.\n\nThe last but not the least argument refers solely to the financial aspect of the issue. After the economic crisis of 2008, many people around the world, including the United States, started to experience difficulties with their financial condition. School uniforms may cost significant sums of money, so some parents cannot afford to buy the required clothes for their children. On the other hand, not enabling obligatory school uniforms allows parents with lower incomes to be satisfied about their children’s appearance (Examiner.com).###"}
{"prompt":"What are the negative consequences of women serving in the army?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The 21st century can be fairly called the age of proclaimed equality of genders. Today, one can count much less occupations that remain solely masculine—women are constantly conquering new positions and proving they are also capable of participating in physically challenging activities. This refers particularly to war. 50 years ago, the idea of a woman serving in the army in full combat would seem ridiculous—today it is a reality. However, is such an advancement reasonable? Though women have successfully proved they can doubtfully be called a weak gender, war is one of those occupations women should not take part in, since it results in a series of negative consequences in regard to their health and the state of the military in which they participate.\n\nNature has made women physically weaker and less durable than men. No matter how angry feminists can get about such statements, a woman, even a trained one in military boot camps, can hardly match a man in physical strength. Therefore, if women would be allowed to serve in the army, they would either need to match with the already existing training standards, or the standards themselves have to be lowered across the board. Officials from the West Point Academy inform that after women were allowed to serve in the military, men are no longer required to run carrying heavy weapons, which was considered a norm before (Fire & Knowledge). This is only one example of the changes that have occurred from the admission of women in the army. As a result, the army’s fighting capability lowers.\n\nNormal physical exercises for men are often excruciating for women. A women’s health can be damaged by constant physical loads; this especially refers to the reproductive system. According to recent research from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, excessive exercise can seriously reduce a women’s fertility (ScienceDaily). In addition, it can result in amenorrhea, problems with menstruation cycles, hormonal balance, and other aspects of health. It is obvious: compared to the perspective of becoming infertile and having many specific health issues, the benefits from serving in the army are rather doubtful.\n\nPerhaps future armies will count as many women as men, but today women represent a minority in the military. Thus, having one woman placed in a whole squad of men is not rare. Being surrounded by men is psychologically awkward for women and men as well; besides, chances of sexual harassment increase dramatically due to this psychological friction, despite all of the discipline of the military (Suite 101). Women negatively affect discipline in a male environment, thus reducing the army’s combatant value.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the evidence for and against the existence of a higher power?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" From the claim of the famous philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, “God is dead” to the mass rise of atheism worldwide, an intellectual revolution has unfolded and has continued to spread in order to denounce a higher power. Mainly the contention against God is based on an opposition to the philosophy of fundamentalist Christian sects, where God decides fate and has created the world in seven days, or Islamic sects that claim that no prophet besides Muhammad is real. Through this narrow argumentation, atheists have discarded a higher power altogether. But even if the claim “God is dead” is referring to a universal phenomenon and not just an ecclesiastical one, I cannot understand the logic of it. Denying the existence of an entity beyond our capacity is cancelling out every mystical experience human beings have undergone in the entire history of our existence. I ascertain a spiritual force exists in the universe based on this historical, manifold evidence.\n\nTo write about every traditional and modern culture that propounds the idea of mystic experiences would be time-consuming and almost endless. The best I can do in this short frame of words is to put forth logic. Atheists claim believing in a higher power is mass delusion (Hanold 411). This may seem like a revolutionary idea, yet it is rather narrow-sighted. In order for this notion to be true, one would have to discount every mystical experience that humankind has lived through. Not only that, but theorists would have to discharge many different kinds of mystical experiences without any true scientific basis—only on the foundation of propaganda and skepticism (Hanold 133).\n\nMysticism is two-fold: practical and abstract (Jennings 45). Practical mysticism commonly is associated with healing, as modern doctors have not been around forever. One such instance of this is within Australian aboriginal culture, which uses healing techniques without medication, such as touch and breathing (Samus 784). There are thousands, and maybe millions of these types of accounts: how can we deny these occurrences under a blanket of mass delusion (Samus 522)?\n\nAbstract mysticism usually refers to transcendent experiences within human consciousness. For an example of abstract mysticism, the Sufi order of Islam alone has millions of accounts of rising above worldly senses and consciousness (Hanold 23). Beyond religion itself, there are thousands of testimonials of physical, emotional, and mental transcendence without drugs and psychosis being entered into the equation (Hanold 433). In fact, it is rare a human being does not feel the presence of a higher power at least once in his or her life, if not for a second—looking up at the sky in awe, feeling a sudden unexplained peace, their consciousness radically shifting to a sense of satisfaction or sharp awareness in the matter of a second (Jennings 126).\n\nDid all the religious, spiritual, and seeking people in the world get together and form an alliance to spread untruth in order to gain sway over global politics and economics? Doubtful. Does every human being have an innate tendency to believe in a supernatural power in order to feel comforted by the reality they experience without the backing of logic or personal experience and is this tendency based on strict scientific explanation? No such evidence has been applied and no tendency as stated has been examined within the strictures of science as conclusive (Samus 756). The absurdity of the atheist agenda is not so much that it has focused primarily on Christian creationism and Islamic extremism, but that it has ignored millions of personal accounts the world over of practical and abstract mysticism by proposing a guise of mass delusion inherent in human beings. Besides the point: if the confusion is real, is reality better?###"}
{"prompt":"Is surveillance through security cameras an invasion of privacy?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Technological progress has made such surveillance and control methods possible that would appear as science-fiction a couple decades ago: satellites, electronic chips, Internet databases, and so on. However, the progress goes faster than consumers and government agencies are able to adopt and accept novelties, and thus conflicts regarding privacy and the appropriateness of control methods can arise. One of the most debated issues at current is whether or not surveillance through security cameras has negative effects on the public.\n\nThough crime cameras have proved themselves to be an effective tool for fighting street and organized crime, concerns about their wide use still remain. Nancy La Vigne, the director of Chicago’s Justice Policy Center, says camera systems are often believed to be violating citizens’ constitutionally-protected right to privacy when they are used to identify non-lawbreakers (SmartPlanet). Though there are rules limiting cameras’ possibilities (for example, they should not be able to pan, tilt, and zoom in order not to look into the windows of the apartment buildings or backyards), how can one be sure they are not watched and these rules are observed? Surveys show about 23% of U.S. citizens tend to believe security cameras violate their privacy (Rasmussen Reports).\n\nOpponents of surveillance also stress the fact that security cameras can evoke negative emotions in citizens, and make them feel like they are being constantly watched and controlled. This refers both to adults, who already have an established system of views on the state, the government, and the society—and children, who are in the process of developing such a system. A senior policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union, Jay C. Stanley, thinks “Constant surveillance, from the time children enter school to the time they leave, teaches the wrong thing about the relationship between the citizen and the government in a democratic society.” Stated succinctly, children may believe the State has a right to interfere in the private lives of its citizens, and being under control and surveillance is a norm (Association of American Educators).\n\nCitizens sensitive to civil liberties can find surveillance through cameras extremely uncomfortable and stressing. Usually, these are people who are extremely passionate about the privacy of their lives, or about their personal security; the proponents of left-wing political and conspiracy theories also tend to treat surveillance cameras negatively, as a tool of the State oppressing its citizens. Also, people with psychological disorders—for example those with paranoid tendencies—can display severe disturbance about the fact of being watched.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the main reasons for western culture's decay?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Though many of us have become accustomed to seeing culture as an aggregate of an artistic and historical heritage, this is a rather broad term. According to Merriam Webster’s dictionary, culture can be defined as customary beliefs, social norms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social group; the characteristic features of everyday existence (as diversions or a way of life) shared by people in a place or time (Merriam-Webster). In this meaning, western culture is experiencing a prolonged decay, despite its technological novelties, proclaimed tolerance, equality of opportunities, and constant striving to make everyday existence more safe and comfortable.\n\nSo why do we say that western culture is in a state of decay? In the past, English politician Edward Gibbon had suggested several criteria of the Roman decaying culture. Among them he listed: common concern about looking wealthy instead of being one; freakish art; and the widening disparity between the rich and the poor (Goodreads). Surprisingly, it seems that these criteria are suitable not only for ancient Romans, but for the western modern world as well. Let us take a closer look.\n\nOne of the main reasons for western culture’s decay is its focus on displaying wealth and creating images of it, instead of amassing material gain or being true to oneself. This problem is deeper than it may seem; it is not an innocent show-off. Mass media, public opinion, commercials, and product manufacturers teach western people to assess themselves and others by their possessions. If to simplify this thesis, it would not be a great exaggeration to say that a person with a yearly income of $40,000 is often considered less worthwhile than a person with a $100,000 income, though this is an unfair and erroneous way to treat people. This leads to a specific type of behavior. Instead of working on self-improvement and building up wealth and career, people seem to be more engrossed by the external signs of success and prosperity, even when they completely differ from the image they try to create. In order to be able to purchase “status signs,” which are often rather expensive, they get into debt and take loans, which creates a negative effect on the economy and spins the wheel of consumption even stronger.\n\nAccording to recent research, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened. In 1967, those in the lowest percentile of American earners made a median salary of $9,300. By 2010, that was up to $11,900—a 28% increase (measured in 2010 dollars). The 90% of the richest Americans went from making a median of $85,800 in 1967 to $138,900, which made a 62% increase. Median income households saw real earnings go from $40,800 in 1967 to $49,400 (Face the Facts USA). This illustrates a phrase that “the richest become richer, the poorest become even poorer.”\n\nIf we look at modern art, which directly refers to the term of culture, we will see that its priorities have changed significantly, starting from the beginning of the 20th century. Today’s art is mostly flabbergasting; its main purpose is to shock the viewer, make them feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, anxious, or angry. This is often achieved by the heavy exploitation and amplification of sexual, violent, and religious scenes, and granting them a deep meaning. For example, Chris Ofili’s “Holy Virgin Mary” exhibited in the Brooklyn Museum in 1999, showing a black Madonna covered with animal feces, was described as “playing with the ideas of blasphemy and worship, race and religion, toying in a gently ironic way with the space between public outrage and private expression to make his own spiritual statement, which among other things is not original” (The New York Times). When an art product like this one appears once in a decade, it may be called a daring provocation, but when they become trendy, it may be considered a diagnosis for culture.\n\nWestern culture, full of contradictions and uncomfortable compromises, is slowly slipping out of balance. This can be seen by the increasing social inequality expressed in the widening gap between the rich and the poor; in art, most of which is completely unaesthetic; in people’s obsession by external signs of success, and not in real development, or in other words, in their obsession of the artificial. Social norms and customary beliefs, affected by these and many other factors, constantly transform to make their careers more adapted to socio-economic and cultural processes, which gradually runs out of control.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits and drawbacks of technology?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Humans in ancient times used to believe in magic as a way of shaping and transforming the surrounding reality according to the will and intention of the practitioner. Shamans, exorcists, and priests all around the globe had summoned rains and spirits, cured wounds and cursed enemies. Today, people are more rational and pragmatic, and magic in our world remains intact only in books. However, humanity has found a much more effective substitute for this mystical discipline, and this substitute is technology. Magic was for the chosen few—technology is for everyone. People praise technologies claiming that they allow them to save time and lives, and that they make their lives easier. But are technologies beneficial for humankind?\n\nThe foremost argument of the proponents of the point of view that technologies are beneficial is that they allow people to save their personal time. To some extent, they are right, because housewives today do not need to spend whole days cooking or doing laundry; it usually takes them a couple of hours, due to washing machines, electric ovens, dishwashing machines, vacuum cleaners, and other appliances. However, we can take a look at this claim from another perspective, and ask ourselves: but what do people do with all this free time? The answer can be disappointing. According to research, in 2010, Americans spent an average of 13 hours per week online (Newser), consuming 16 minutes on social networks for every hour online. In 2012, watching TV for about 34 hours a week was also a common index for USA citizens over the age of two. For elderly people, the average index is 48 hours a week (NY Daily News). It can be implied that TV and social networks, which are also products of technologies, distract people from self-development, culture, physical activities, and live communication.\n\nPeople became dependent on technologies; at the same time, people often have no idea how these technologies work. Stated succinctly, technology is still a kind of magic. If a business owner finds his cellphone broken, he or she is helpless, as he or she cannot fix it or perform his or her functions without it. If a person’s car does not start, they will most likely not be able to take a look at the engine and fix the problem. If electricity is completely out for at least a week (including all possible reserve systems, as well as atomic and wind sources of energy), our social, economic, and political systems will collapse.\n\nTechnologies constantly advance. Every day, manufacturers the world over introduce technological novelties, which, as they claim, are better and more effective than their previous analogues. New appliances and gadgets usually cost more; for an example, one needs to look no further than any smartphone or tablet of an older and newer model. Commercials, advertisements, public opinions, and personal cravings motivate individuals to seek ways to purchase technological novelties despite the lack of finances or the absence of intelligible need. For example, Wang Shangkun, a Chinese student, had sold his kidney to purchase a new model of the iPad tablet in 2012 (Telegraph). Unfortunately, his case is not unique. On the other hand, the inability to buy new gadgets can cause severe stress.\n\nTechnological progress today is what moves humankind forward. Many daily activities have become easier and more pleasant due to all kinds of appliances and gadgets. They can be of a great help, but at the same time, they can also cause harm to them. Technologies grant their users more free time, but cannot offer worthy activities, thus making people spend their free time online or watching TV. People have become extremely dependent on technologies, but often have no idea how they work. In addition, due to advertising and public opinion, people feel obliged to spend excessive amounts money to purchase newer appliances, and can experience stress in case of the inability to do so.###"}
{"prompt":"How should we view celebrities?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Celebrities have become akin to gods to the public. They are worshiped in bedrooms by way of large posters displaying their photoshopped bodies, they are read about obsessively through social media and news, and their advice is even heeded in regard to global issues and personal difficulties. Should celebrities be honored with this type of reverence? Or should we, instead, look to ourselves for inspiration and the discretion to know what is right? The answers to these questions should become apparent when we know celebrities are commonly drug-affected, usually lend themselves to an unstable family life, and are associated with a high rate of crime. In light of this knowledge, we should be able to ascertain the public’s reverence towards celebrities is illogical and even ludicrous.\n\nThe abuse of illegal drugs is a common occurrence when it comes to celebrities. According to a study done at Harvard University by Professor Hilary Dunsk, celebrities are associated with illegal drug use at the rate of 72.6%, while on average, citizens globally are connected with illegal drug use at a rate of 13.7% (Dunsk 256). This difference is alarming, and demonstrates celebrities are not exactly the role-models we need for our children, or for anyone for that matter. In another study by the Rochester think tank Bullies Are Us, cultural psychologist Damond Poppard noted how children through the ages of 7-15 in Britain were 13.3% more likely to purchase illegal drugs after following the lives of celebrities via social media platforms for a three-month period (Poppard 56).\n\nIf we believe celebrities are decent role-models for families, we need to think again. From a global perspective, celebrities have an average of two divorces, and have to pay a median fee of $152,156 per year in child custody payments (Friedrich 211). Take in account the average rate for the global citizen: .7 divorces and $3,572 in payments for child custody payments each year (Friedrich 211). The celebrity lifestyle is clearly not an advantageous example for the public in terms of family life.\n\nWe would not want our children, or our adult friends as well, to be associated with criminals, right? According to a Princeton study by Professor Harold Cramer, almost 4 out 10 celebrities commit crimes which are or could be reprimanded by law (Cramer 11). This percentage can be compared to the rate of non-celebrities committing crimes, which is .12 out of 10 (Cramer 12). With this statistic, it is obvious how associating oneself with a celebrity is close to being linked to a criminal.\n\nWhen we take into account how many celebrities use illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer how celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities—we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings which should not be given the honor they have incurred.###"}
{"prompt":"How can democracy succeed if so many people are illiterate?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Modern people worship a number of idols: private property, freedom of choice, psychoanalysis, entertainment, the global economy, and many other domains of life. Perhaps the most powerful of these idols is democracy: a made-up god responsible for many war conflicts, ineffective governments, and the ignorance of common people. Though people worship democracy as a self-valuable phenomenon that can protect them from all evil exclusively, this form of government is useless without the efforts and responsibility of these same people.\n\nDemocracy is believed to be the best way for realizing human rights (Bohman 2007). Democracy is a form of government which implies that citizens are given the power to propose, develop, and create laws either directly or through representatives. Unfortunately, democracy can be fairly called an utopia suitable only for a perfect world that is make-believe. The former president Franklin D. Roosevelt once said, “Democracy cannot succeed unless those who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely. The real safeguard of democracy, therefore, is education.”\n\nThe total adult literacy rate around the world in 2010 was 84.1% (The World Bank Group 2013). This means about 785 million illiterate adults still can be found all over the world. Considering the words spoken by President John F. Kennedy, that in democracy, the ignorance of one voter impairs the security of all, imagine what the ignorance of 785 million voters could do. For instance, let us take a look at plebiscites. For example, it asks the voters only one question that can be answered only “yes” or “no”: “Does the country need a bicameral parliament?” Would all voters be aware of the possible consequences for the whole nation? What are the advantages and disadvantages of bicameral parliaments? How do they make decisions? Are they more effective and expensive than one-house parliaments? Only when every single voter is properly educated, democracy can succeed.\n\nMost U.S. citizens consider dictatorship the only possible alternative to democracy. They push for democracy, as they believe all other options are worse. This is commonly not true—a society is not a rigid and conservative structure, unable to adapt to changes and find new ways of development; on the contrary, it is highly fluid and flexible, and forms of social organization that seemed impossible several decades ago are now the part of everyday reality. For example, one needs to look no further than the Arab Spring: a sequence of revolutionary transformations that had their origins in online social networks. What people need to understand is that voting, elections, freedom of speech, and other highly valued idols of every “democratic” societies are useless and even harmful if not used properly. Modern democracies sometimes look like ignorant crowds ruled by a minority, competent enough to make everyone believe it is the common people who run everything. Granting the educated representatives a right to rule is an act of idleness: people must become educated themselves, so they can be responsible for the life of their society and personal community.\n\nThe key to a rich, progressive country is not democracy by itself, but education. An ignorant crowd which has a right to choose from a number of options can inflict more damage to the state than a well-educated monarch or dictator. Only when people are totally prepared to be responsible for their actions, democracy will prove itself as the most efficient way of running a nation. Until then, it remains a false utopia.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the consequences of abortion?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The ideas of tolerance and human rights protection, based on the idea that every human being is the master of his or her own life, have contributed to letting people live as they want and do what they will—in reasonable measures. In particular, tolerance has seemingly resolved or smoothed-out a number of moral dilemmas that humanity faced during the past centuries. However, there still are several extremely important and disputable issues, such as euthanasia, implanted ID chips, biometric identification, and abortion. Abortion is, perhaps, one of the oldest, and one of the most difficult issues to sort out among them; while proponents of abortion call for its acceptance, its opponents believe that it is immoral and inexcusable. And though many human rights protectors claim that every woman can do whatever she sees as just, I am strongly convinced that abortions can not be tolerated, as they harm mothers and their innocent children.\n\nAny reasonable and sound person would be outraged if someone offered to grant mothers a right to kill their babies immediately after birth. This would be called inhumane and immoral—it would be a crime. However, this is what proponents of abortions do by standing for the etching of an embryo before birth. They ignore the fact that the baby is already a human being, from the very first days after conception. According to W. L. Saunders, “Every human being begins as a single-cell zygote, grows through the embryonic stage, then the fetal stage, is born and develops through infancy, through childhood, and through adulthood, until death. Each human being is genetically the same human being at every stage, despite changes in his or her appearance” (Saunders). In other words, abortion is still infanticide: a killing of a living human being, despite the fact that the child is still in the womb.\n\nMoreover, abortions do not pass without a trace in terms of women’s health. Though there exist chemical preparations that allow the stopping of pregnancy without surgery, they are as dangerous as physical intervention. According to recent research, abortions cause a significant risk of ectopic pregnancy, not to mention other diseases, such as breast cancer and infertility. “Statistics show a 30% increased risk of ectopic pregnancy after one abortion and a 160% increased risk of ectopic pregnancy after two or more abortions. There has been a threefold increase in ectopic pregnancies in the U.S. since abortion was legalized. In 1970, the incidence was 4.8 per 1,000 live births. By 1980, it was 14.5 per 1,000 births” (AF).\n\nAnother argument is that a woman who has decided to get rid of the embryo is about to kill herself as well. Though an abortion may seem to be an option for underage mothers, or victims of rape, etching the baby does not free a woman, or calm her down. According to statistics, women who had abortions tend to commit suicides much more often than those who chose to give birth to a baby: 28% of women who committed an abortion attempted suicides (AfterAbortion). Among other problems are alcohol and drug abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, sexual dysfunction, and many other issues.\n\nThough abortions are often seen as an option for women who, due to various circumstances, do not want to give birth to a baby, it is perhaps the worst choice. No matter how a child looks like in a womb, no matter how underdeveloped its consciousness and nervous system is, it is still a human being that has a right to live. Besides, abortions cause severe physiological and psychological damage to canceled mothers, such as ectopic pregnancy, terminal diseases, depression and suicidal behavior, alcohol and drug abuse.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the evidence for extraterrestrial intelligent life?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Understanding the Universe has been a continual mystery to humanity. Throughout human history, individuals have been searching for answers to numerous questions that were provoked by the unknown space above their heads. Insights provided by shamans, priests, and scientists have increased curiosity about the esoteric nature of the Universe rather than decreased it. Though it may seem as if we know much about the Universe now, this is an illusion. The most significant mystery still lies in the question, “Is there extraterrestrial life?” Just as Christopher Columbus saw that first glimpse of previously unknown land (to the western world) on the horizon, it may turn out that we will happen upon another species that is as intelligent as us, or even more so.\n\nOne huge leap has already been made in this quest. Scientific research has shown that living organisms can survive in conditions much different than those that are present on Earth. This is confirmed by the existence of extremophiles—organisms that thrive in conditions lethal for other forms of life. These conditions may include high pressures, the presence of toxins, an absence of oxygen, extreme temperatures, and acidity. One extremophile species, the Ferroplasma acidiphilum, is a microorganism that can only survive in environments containing such large concentrations of iron that any other life form would expire there. Not only can extremophiles thrive in these conditions, but they cannot survive in what are considered to be normal environments. These organisms alone prove that life can exist in conditions on planets that were previously thought of as too extreme (Silverman, 2009).\n\nNumerous UFO sighting reports can be considered as a significant piece of evidence in favor of the existence of extraterrestrial life. What makes some of these accounts difficult to deny even for the strongest skeptics are claims made by reputable people, such as law enforcement, the military, pilots, and even astronauts. For example, in the early hours of December 14, 1994 in Trumbull County, Ohio, police were flooded by phone calls from alarmed citizens claiming they were observing an UFO in the sky. A policeman drove out to the area where the reports were coming from to put an end to what he thought was a hoax. But after he arrived at the place, he too had witnessed the UFO that supposedly lit up the entire sky and caused the malfunction of electronic devices within his patrol cruiser. That is just one example from thousands of reports made each year all over the world (Rense, 2012).\n\nScientists have also made attempts to calculate the possibility of extraterrestrial existence mathematically. In 2001, an astronomer by the name of Frank Drake developed an equation that was later named after him. Drake distinguished eight fundamental factors that would enable intelligent life to thrive, subsequently creating an equation that estimated the amount of planets that could hold the possibility of these essentials to be present. His results were astounding and showed that hundreds of thousands of planets other than Earth could contain intelligent life forms. The basis for this equation originated at Ohio State University in 1977 when a radio signal was picked up with a frequency that was known as improbable. This transmission lasted 37 seconds and came from a location over 220 million light years away from the nearest star. The only conclusion that could be drawn is that some sort of intelligent life had to have existed in order to send this signal, since it was most likely sent with the help of a technological device (Kaulay, n.d.).\n\nLiving in an age when technology has made it possible to access virtually endless information with the click of a button, it is easy to forget that humanity still remains ignorant about the wonders of nature. One such mystery is extraterrestrial intelligent life. The existence of extremophiles, numerous UFO reports all over the world, and mathematical evidence such as the Drake equation, speak in favor of the claim that humanity is not the only clever species in the Universe. A few decades or centuries later, the idea that humans could ever be the only intelligent life form may seem laughable. Until then, the innate hunger for the answer to the question of whether humanity is alone in the Universe or not will persist.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages and disadvantages of solar energy?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Our modern industrial civilization is to a large extent based on using fossil fuels. Still, due to overpopulation, climate change, and the scarcity of resources, one of the most precious and efficient sources of energy, oil, has already started to exhaust (Bode, 2005, p.81). This fact has caused scientists globally to seek for substitutes to fossil fuels to avoid economic and industrial collapse. Experts in the field of sustainable energy have turned their attention increasingly towards solar energy in particular as a viable alternative to fossil fuels.\n\nSolar technology utilizes the Sun’s energy to produce electricity and does not rely on the continual mining of raw materials. Consequently, this does not result in the annihilation of ecosystems, as witnessed in the extraction of fossil fuels. For instance, in the river Niger Delta, an ongoing irresponsible and excessive oil extraction can be witnessed. As a result of this activity, the mass extinction of fish has been observed in the region, as well as the abandonment of whole villages where people used to live on fishing (Nelson, 2008, p. 63). Another well-known incident is the BP oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico, which spilled over a million cubic meters of crude oil. Using solar energy does not imply releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere; the energy production process for it is free from any gas, smoke, or other chemical waste.\n\nSolar energy, unlike other sources of conventional energy, is free from monthly or other charges, except the first installation and maintenance fees. Operational costs are also negligible. Solar energy does not require costly and ongoing raw materials, such as coal or oil, and unlike conventional power production, operational labor is redundant. Professor Richards Hans from the University of South Calgary (2012) notes that the prices of fossil fuels keep increasing and the production price per watt of solar energy has reduced by 60% in the past five years (p. 29). This, together with the fact that solar energy power plants may be independent from the national energy grid, is a significant advantage for people in isolated localities; solar energy is more cost-effective and practical for self-reliant societies, or those who live in rural or isolated areas. It is practical since it is much cheaper to install solar energy systems than putting up power lines; it is cost-effective due to conventional sources of energy depending on a variety of factors, like transportation of petroleum and frequent maintenance.\n\nThose with divergent views on solar energy insist the cost of installing solar energy system is higher compared to conventional sources of energy (Demirbas, 2008. P.38). They also argue that solar panels require excessive amounts of space for installation, and this might hinder its application in limited space, such as urban areas. According to Professor Ayhan Demirbas from the University of North Seattle (2008), the reason why installation costs are relatively higher is due to solar panels being made from materials that have exorbitant costs (p.38). However, as solar energy becomes more and more competitive due to shortages facing other sources of power, prices are expected to come down. Governments seeking to cut down carbon emissions may also subsidize the cost of installation.\n\nSolar energy has the potential of becoming the most significant source of energy in the nearest future. Since there are no chemicals or gases involved in energy production on solar plants, this type of energy can be considered one of the cleanest. Solar energy is also cheap and practical. Solar plants may be constructed off the national energy grid, which is beneficial for small self-reliant societies, and they do not require monthly or other charges. Those disputing the viability of solar energy as an alternative to fossil fuel insist that installing solar panels is expensive and requires plenty of space. However, government subsidies and other measures are likely to reduce said costs, and the problem of free space is also in the process of resolving. On the whole, it is clear that fossil fuel deposits are getting lower and lower each day. Therefore, increasing numbers of people will continue to embrace solar energy as the best alternative to fossil fuels.\n\nNelson, Vaughn. (2008). Introduction to Renewable Energy.

{"prompt":"What is the main danger of euthanasia?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You may have heard of the stories of a doctor or nurse deliberately helping their incurable patient pass on to the other side. They are usually promptly arrested, and the mass media enjoys giving these persons names like “Angels of Death” or “Suicide Helpers.” Some people might think such doctors’ actions are merciful and graceful, since many patients who are terminally ill are waiting to die, sometimes being in severe pain. Yet, there are also opponents to this rationale who claim that killing is still killing, no matter what motives the murderer had, or how difficult the patient’s suffering was. One of the main questions in treating patients who cannot be cured is whether mercy killings are to be allowed legally to help end someone’s suffering—the answer should be, “No.”\n\nEuthanasia—the proper term for mercy killing—is the practice of intentionally ending a life in order to relieve pain and suffering. This assumes a patient is aware they are going to die, and in some cases, they must administer the poison themselves. This is also called assisted suicide.\n\nArguments supporting euthanasia usually present the fact that the patient would have no cure, and no way of contributing to society in the state they are in. They claim humanity cannot help such individuals either: all that can be done is prolonging their agony when suffering from terminal diseases, or letting them live with a defective life in the case of suffering from serious mental deviations. However, the very thought of killing people due to their disabilities seems unnatural; besides, who is competent and authorized enough to decide whom to kill and whom to let live?\n\nThe German child Gerhard Kretschmar, whose case is one of the most well-known examples of euthanasia, was born blind, missing limbs, and prone to convulsions. Adolf Hitler gave Kretschmar’s doctor permission to commit a child murder, since medicine could not help him. This incident started the Nazis’ T4 Program (that implied killing incurably ill people, as well as physically and mentally-disabled individuals), and led to the killings of almost 300,000 mentally and physically handicapped people who otherwise would have no other way of being cured (BBC). The problem is that while Kretchmar’s killing was done by parental consent, 5,000 to 8,000 children were forcibly taken from their parents because the state decided to do so. These children were either starved to death or killed by lethal injection.\n\nAs the T4 Program continued, handicapped people were killed with gas vans and killing centers, eventually leading to the death of 70,000 German adults. Since this campaign was clearly being used as a murderous machine to take out the unwanted, the definition of euthanasia was stretched to fit the government’s viewpoint. The main danger here is that in the scenario of modern society weakening its control over the issue of euthanasia, history can repeat itself and soon it will be up to the government whether or not you are able to contribute to society.\n\nPeople who want to commit suicide—due to despair, disappointment, or for any other reason—seem to be unwilling to make this fearsome step on their own. Thus, they strive to share the responsibility of cutting their lives short in the presence of others, basically with doctors. But if a person feels they want to die, they should not bring in someone to do it. If suicide is illegal, then why are we helping people commit suicide? The very fact that people call it mercy killing does not mean that it stops to be a murder, since you still take their lives away.\n\nEuthanasia is an act of seeming mercy, and should not be allowed legally. While being justified as humane towards people who suffer and cannot live a full life, it is a murder no better than many others and different only in motives. No person is authorized to decide whether another person should live or die except that person. In the case of an individual deciding to pass away beforehand, no one should help him or her in this deed. Besides, there exists the danger that governments may take the role of a judge deciding whom to kill, as it has happened in Nazi Germany. The consequences of this could be truly dreadful.\n\n###"}
{"prompt":"How can couples improve their relationships?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When two people start a romantic relationship, they first show their best features to partners in order to keep them interested. However, after a while, routine sets in and it seems there is nothing new to discover. Thus, passion, which has been holding the relationship together, fades away and continuing the relationship may become difficult. In most cases, love and romance are understood as a kind of merging of individualistic partners, when each person seeks to fulfill their own needs at the expense of another, instead of trying to grow and develop. When one or both partners stop growing, the relationship enters a stage of stagnation, which may keep them from living a happy life or end in separation. “Relationships are like a dance, with visible energy racing back and forth between partners. Some relationships are the slow, dark dance of death” (Dowling 79). With this said, it is important for the success of a relationship for its participants to constantly look for ways for individual growth.\n\nAccording to recent studies conducted in the United Kingdom, a focus on infidelity as the main cause for divorce has shifted onto a phenomenon called “falling out of love” (Dowling 102). This phenomenon is reflected in the fact there is nothing new to discover about the other person and the reasons that made them fall in love fade away as time goes by. Stated succinctly, adhering to a “comfort zone” in the relationship is rather dangerous. A comfortable relationship is marked by easily forgetting about personal growth. Still, the truth is improving and taking care of yourself helps build a better and richer relationship with your partner.\n\nThe main reason why it is difficult for people to leave relationships which have become insipid is only a few think of personal improvement as one of the key factors in fixing their partnership. Couples need to stay interesting for each other, as when there is nothing fresh to discover, the relationship can become fragile. Besides, reality shows us how to be a couple: each partner should possess high self-esteem to cope better with the inevitable adverse issues that are presented in one’s life (Dowling 56).\n\n“Partners with low self-esteem read too much into problems, seeing them as a sign that their partner’s affections and commitment might be waning. They then derogate their partner and reduce closeness. Being less sensitive to rejection, however, partners with high self-esteem affirm their partner in the face of any threat. Ironically, a chronic need for acceptance may result in low self-esteem, people seeing signs of rejection where none exist, needlessly weakening attachments” (Murray 202). However, many people do not realize that maintaining a relationship is personal work. Unrecognized and unresolved problems may result in a sequence of frustrations in the relationship, which continue until a person realizes the real reasons for failure.\n\nThere are several necessary things to remember about a healthy relationship. Many couples feel intimidated, as they believe they will be misunderstood, laughed at, or that the relationship will break because of what they said. This fear seems unbearable, but trust is essential (Murray 200). Individuals with higher self-esteem are more honest about what they need and want from their partners. They talk about what the relationship is lacking instead of waiting until the partner guesses the possible issues that have arisen.\n\nAnother important factor is having a social life outside of a romantic relationship. It is extremely harmful for couples to dwell only on each other. New impressions, contacts, and acquaintances are crucial for a healthy relationship. Partners should also seek to be interesting to each other, learn new activities to have fresh topics to talk about, and look for novel ways to spend time together.\n\nThe financial side of the issue also plays its role. When both partners are economically independent, it is less likely one will feel stressed about being the sole breadwinner and the other will feel insecure because of having no steady income (Dowling 124).\n\nThere are no exact instructions when it comes to such an intimate phenomenon as a romantic relationship. Every couple should search for what works best for them, as each couple is unique. However, it can be reasonably stated that in order to build a strong and long-lasting relationship, couples should pay more attention to their own personalities. It is extremely difficult, or even impossible, to improve the relationship itself, or change some features of a partner which one does not like. The key point is to reinvent yourself. Despite being a seeming paradox, the more attention you pay to your own life and development, the richer the relationship will become.###"}
{"prompt":"How is economic growth connected to environmental damage?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Though nowadays it is more often claimed that humanity can develop without causing damage to nature, there still are strong opposing arguments to this hypothesis. Development assumes economic growth, and economic growth is impossible without industry, which needs energy resources. Currently, the range of goods required by common people has expanded significantly compared to the times before modern industrial technology was employed on a mass scale. People feel the need, not only for primary essentials, such as a slice of bread and a roof over their heads, but also for various facilities and luxuries. Providing humanity with these objects involves the exploitation of natural resources. In turn, the conventional sources of energy we use today cause pollution, so economic growth is almost inevitably associated with environmental damage.\n\nOne of the aspects of economic growth that affects the environment most of all is that in order to produce more goods and products at a faster rate, the construction of large industrial plants is required. These enterprises generate mass amounts of pollution in the form of liquid waste and gaseous fumes. Liquid waste is frequently dumped in fresh water bodies, while gaseous fumes are released into the atmosphere. Liquid waste leads to the pollution of water and the damaging of aquatic ecosystems (Jion 365). Gaseous fumes pollute the atmosphere, which may cause negative, long-term health effects to nearby populations of animals or people. They also lead to the degradation of the ozone layer, which is one of the main reasons for the acceleration of global warming.\n\nThe conventional energy sources that are commonly used nowadays are considered to be the greatest polluters of the environment, and intensive rates of industrial manufacturing lead to constantly increasing energy consumption. One might say the solution lies in the usage of non-conventional sources of energy, such as tidal, geothermal, or wind energy. They are preferred due to their environmentally-friendly means of energy generation, but at the same time, they possess several critical drawbacks. The high installation cost is one of them. Besides, they are yet less effective than conventional ones, and need the accompanying political will to initiate. Transiting from one energy source to another also requires time, during which people have to make some sacrifices to support these undertakings. In a democratic country, making people accept this would pose a challenge (Robert 209).\n\nSimultaneously, even if implemented, non-conventional sources of energy still do not resolve the problem of inflicting damage to the environment. In order to produce economically viable energy—utilizing tidal and geothermal sources—a sometimes significant distortion of the natural site is often inevitable (Robert 201). This is expensive and has substantial harmful effects on the environment. The application of wind energy would necessitate blocking the airflows’ natural velocity, which is the reason for their decrease in strength after crossing the windmill. Consequently, the pressure balance that is brought about by this current will be affected, and it is important to remember that the environment and weather conditions are directly affected by atmospheric pressure.\n\nAs one can see, economic growth is connected to environmental damage, and at the current level of development, humanity can hardly avoid harming nature. This is caused by a number of factors, such as the inaccessibility and costliness of alternative sources of energy. But the most significant reason is that constant economic growth leads to the increase in the rate of industrial production. With the expansion of industry, more conventional resources are needed, and since their usage causes severe pollution, it can be concluded that economic growth is inseparable from the damage inflicted on the environment.###"}
{"prompt":"How does music inspire people?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Inspiration is a phenomenon with many variables. It is difficult to tell when it will come, arduous to predict when it will leave, yet it is a soulful feast nonetheless. When in the realm of inspiration, ordinary objects can seem phenomenal and the slightest details can be observed (Cannus 64). Inspiration is a wonderful state, as we are most productive and joyful when inspired. In a way, our whole life is searching for that particular state of inspiration we have come to call ecstasy. In this life-long race for the extraordinary to excite us, though, we sometimes get tired of searching. When life induces too much stress, too much noise, and too much rush, it is wondrous to put your headphones on, click play on your favorite playlist, and close your eyes, giving way to music.\n\nThe styles of music can vary greatly. It takes a discerning listener to classify a particular song, as it may have strains of several music trends. Besides trends, each culture produces its specific music. To me, music is more than just a way to relax and take a break. Music is my companion for life, my indicator of mood, my best adviser, and my own little world. I would never call music a hobby, as I cannot imagine my life without my favorite music. There is a playlist for when I am sad, for when I am happy, for when I am thoughtful, excited, angry, adventurous, or sleepy. Music helps me to cope with the emotions that I experience. Sometimes, music is a way to hide from everything and everyone. Other times, music is the best way to share my feelings with people I care about, or even with complete strangers. Music is the most inspirational phenomena I can think of for a multitude of reasons.\n\nMusic is a world of emotions and every time I hear a song I like, it shares some of these emotions with me. Music can bring up the most tender and anxious feelings. It can move you in time and space by bringing back special memories of which you were craving to relish. There were many cases when music sent shivers down my spine, so honest and strong were the tunes, so powerful the memories they awakened. I am sure it happened to everyone at least once, that a strong memory is somehow linked to a certain song or tune and whenever you hear it playing, you travel back to that situation in your thoughts, able to experience that it again (Connors 65). We sometimes forget how powerful music is and how inspirational its power can be.\n\nIn addition, music is able unite people like nothing else can (Poplars 45). Sports, mutual interests, and similar experiences can unite people in a substantial way. But what about those cases when people have nothing in common and are total strangers, yet they suddenly find themselves holding hands and singing along, dancing, or simply silently listening to captivating beats. Music is able to make complete strangers feel like they have connected to a kindred soul. If you have at least once been to a great live concert, you probably know what kind of inspiration I am talking about. It is difficult to describe this phenomenon with words, but is it not what proves again the power of music to inspire? You do not need to speak a foreign language to connect to somebody from a different background, using music instead of words. Music comes in handy in these cases. It inspired you to make new friends or learn more about a foreign culture.\n\nMusic is multi-dimensional—you can never get bored of it. While I have a number of favorite artists and bands, I also never stop exploring the musical amplitude and discovering new performers every day. Music adds flavor to my life and this flavor is different depending on “what dish I am eating.” Music can be so much more than an accompaniment—it is a full-fledged spice that can accentuate, muffle, or supplement any experience. If I were to leave for a deserted island and could only take a few items, my player and a couple of solar-charging batteries would be my choice. That way, I could adjust to the environment around me and find inspiration where others might find devastation and frustration.\n\nThough music is nothing new, the creation of new melodies, rhythms, and symphonics will be created every day. In fact, I believe music has been around us for as long as we have existed (Lung 24). When I say that music is everywhere, I first of all mean that music comes from nature—the sound of crackling straw in the field, rustling trees in a grove, or the murmur of a fast mountain stream. Music in all of its forms is around us and the task is only to notice it and learn to appreciate how it can be shared. Music can be a source of inspiration for almost anyone, since it can be a unique key to suite any lock, even the most complicated and tenacious. Music has the power to make us want to smile at every stranger walking by, simply because we are hearing a transcendent song.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the key reasons that people should connect with nature more than they do today?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Despite the technological advances and scientific inventions that make us believe we have nothing in common with the rest of the animal kingdom, we are still part of the planet’s fauna, whether we realize it or not. Needless to say, back when humanity’s main achievements were the invention of a round wheel, or specific tools for farming agriculture, human beings were dependent on nature and paid attention to the changes of its course (George 24). Now, with technological revolutions and discoveries that made up our past history, we seem to pay little attention to nature, getting more and more disconnected from it every day. However, the links we have with nature cannot disappear. There are a number of key reasons in favor of the concept that people should try to connect with nature more than they do today.\n\nNature has historically been the home for human beings, just like it remains a home for animals and plants (with the exception of those that are kept in zoos and greenhouses). Nature is able to show us true beauty without modifications, exaggerations, and falseness. After all, is it not ironic how people go to galleries and exhibitions to look at paintings of colorful flowers, mighty woods, green hills, and fast clear streams; those simple beauties can easily be observed in real life outside of the urban environment which looms around them. Or the fact people purchase recordings of calming sounds of nature, like what you would hear at night in the woods—a damped quavering of an owl, a ringing flare of crickets, and the sonorous rustle of bushes. What we are in fact doing is trying to deceive our minds and make ourselves believe we are in the woods, next to those owls, crickets, and bushes, while we are instead trapped inside our tiny, well-furnished, and packed-with-technology apartment.\n\nIn the era of absolute informational chaos and noise, it becomes more important than ever to be able to pause from the crazy pace of life and relax. Finding silence and peace in the global vacuum of competitiveness, haste, and strain is challenging. We go to doctors for depression, insomnia, and anxiety. We ask for prescriptions and pills, while what we should be doing instead is turning to nature for help. What can be more relaxing and stress-free than a cup of warm herbal tea with fresh honey on the porch of a cozy wooden country house with a view of a small natural lake, or green forest, or beautiful mountains? It is the cheapest, simplest, and most accessible treatment one can think of. We laugh at those “freaks” hugging trees in the park, or walking barefoot on grass. However, these people remember what is essential—what most others have forgotten somewhere along the race to progress and prosperity: the key to being healthy, emotionally sustained and resistant to everyday stress is staying connected to nature and allowing ourselves to put all business on hold and take a break (Swang 54).\n\nNature is about balance and harmony—what we lack when we live inside the swirling pit of urbanized cities. Sometimes we escape, but so rarely and so abruptly, that such escapades can hardly help us reestablish our link with nature. Individuals who live in city areas should consider changing their routine and getting out into nature more regularly. When was the last time you took a walk to a nearby pond, or spent a weekend outdoors doing active sports? When was the last time you went hiking, or fishing, or took your family or friends for a picnic in the nearby park? We should try to move our weekly entertainment, as well as our holiday celebrations, parties, and friendly gatherings, from homes, pubs, and restaurants to lake shores, mountains, parks, forests, ponds, rivers, and groves. The beautiful landscapes of America are incredibly rich and diverse, and this is our true natural wealth we unfortunately often forget about.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of reading books?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is a disappointment that people read books less often in these days of widespread technological reliance (Siam, Book Stats: Why We Should Care). Books were the primary source of intellectual entertainment just a hundred years ago, but with the invention of radio, television, cinematography, and most recently, the Internet and computer games, it seems that reading books is no longer a popular leisure activity. However, I believe that books are an irreplaceable part of our lives, and the role that masterfully-written books play in the personal growth and development of a particular person throughout one’s life is a remarkable one. Books directly expand our consciousness of how we live and where we live, enrich our power to express ourselves, and supply us with inspiration in a way that other mediums cannot compete with.\n\nBooks expand our knowledge and conception of the world around us (Jiken, Solidarity for Books). One may argue that films and TV documentaries do that too, but I believe that books are a much better alternative, since they allow each reader to experience the same story using one’s own imagination. When a hundred people watch a film or a TV show, they see the same content—whatever the director and the producer wish to show. Books are different. The experience achieved through reading is richer and more personal, since the same description and the same word choice will result in as many different interpretations as there are readers. We are all unique, and books allow us to experience whatever is narrated in the light of our own personal values, through our ideas and our imagination.\n\nIn addition, books enrich our vocabulary, introduce us to new notions, and offer a wider choice of words to us. With every book we read, we become more intelligent (Singh, The Braininess of Books). Even reading one seemingly more primitive pulp fiction book per month can enrich one’s personal vocabulary with dozens of new words, help us build more concise sentences on our own, and express oneself better, make one’s speech more intelligent and sophisticated. Watching certain TV programs and documentary films can also widen one’s vocabulary, but hardly as effectively as books do, since reading operates with both more sophisticated visual and audio (if reading aloud) receptors. Moreover, our imagination reproduces mental pictures of what we are reading about, so a new word automatically links to a certain image and a particular feeling that it relates to. Therefore, reading books is a wonderful tool when it comes to learning and developing one’s vocabulary at any age.\n\nBooks are a fantastic source of inspiration. Unlike fine art, architecture, or travelling, books help us create our own mental illustration for what we read on paper. In a way, books make us all artists and creators of our own mental cartoons, movies, or illustration collections (Curtis, Book Artists). Every image we create ourselves is automatically allotted a certain emotion, whether a simple or a more complicated one. Every mental image that a written word projects is vibrant with feelings and emotions. This is what makes books powerful and memorable. Books are an endless source of inspiration and motivation to become a better person.\n\nI am certain that creating a system of symbols and eventually an alphabet, words, and books was the greatest series of inventions of humankind. The books I am talking about are classics, those that do not have an expiration date and will be priceless for any generation. They will continue sparking new ideas, inspiring new deeds, and enriching the lives of every generation to come. I am positive that books will eventually regain their popularity with today’s youth, since unlike the popular kinds of entertainment in fashion today, books are those roots to which people will go back, in search of the motivation, inspiration, and aspiration to find the true meaning and value of life.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the pros and cons of mandatory vaccination?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Ever since the invention of the first smallpox vaccine more than two centuries ago, there has been plenty of controversy over the morality, ethics, effectiveness, and safety of vaccination and immunization. It has recently been argued whether laws should be introduced that render some or all vaccines obligatory for all children (Singer, 2009). Parents, health care specialists, nurses, teachers, and children all have an important stake in this issue. Parents argue that it is they who should have the ultimate decision-making right for deciding whether or not to vaccinate their children. Nurses and health care officials oppose that view on the grounds that by making vaccination rates in children incomplete, we expose all children to contracting the vaccine-preventable diseases. If this is a risk some parents are willing to take, but others face unwillingly, there is obviously a propitious platform for debate.\n\nEvery parent is concerned with their child’s health. However, this concern can take several directions. While some parents are convinced that vaccines have been invented to prevent the human-to-human transmitted diseases, which otherwise can have serious health implications on children and adults, other parents are certain that it is the vaccines themselves that pose a risk to their children’s health. Both have reasons to believe what they do. It has been known that ever since the vaccines for diseases like diphtheria and measles were introduced in the twentieth century, the number of deaths related to these diseases decreased by more than 500 percent. On the other hand, the mid-twentieth century was also the time when such indicators as nutrition, sanitation, health care, and other important factors of spreading vaccine-preventable diseases have been greatly improved (McMahon-Pratt, 2005).\n\nIt is rather difficult to objectively determine what influenced the decrease in the number of deaths—the invention of antibiotics in the 1940s, the improvement of sanitation and healthcare standards, or the introduction of certain vaccines. Those opposing mandatory vaccination choose to believe that it was the first two factors rather than the third one. There are facts to support both versions. For example, death rates from the pertussis (whooping cough) declined from 12,000 deaths per year in 1905 to less than 1,000 deaths per year in 1950—12 times less. But as the pertussis vaccine was not widespread until late 1940s, we can logically assume it obviously was not the vaccine that influenced the mentioned decrease. At the same time, since the vaccine was introduced and popularized, the number of deaths decreased to less than 50 per year, which means the vaccine does help prevent pertussis-caused deaths all the same. Therefore, healthcare specialists do have their reasons to conclude that “low disease rates have been attained through high rates of immunization” (Ring, 2002).\n\nAnother important statement that both sides have each provided solid argumentation in favor of and against is whether a parent should be the one deciding to vaccinate children. After all, it is the freedom of choice of every parent to decide how their child should be treated medically and also to refuse to vaccinate their children if they believe it is too dangerous for them. There has recently been controversies about the deaths caused by low-quality vaccines or improper vaccination processes, as well as the spread of many allergies and chronic predispositions to certain medication as a result of individual body response to vaccination. These are the risks that, unfortunately, cannot always be foreseen and avoided, so calling vaccination a 100% safe prevention method would be definitely wrong (Rinner, 2010).\n\nAt the same time, those parents who do decide to take a risk and vaccinate their children have to still be alerted that they face the same risks of their children getting infected simply because another child in the kindergarten group, or at school, may not have been vaccinated against the same disease and there is always a risk of their kid getting infected. “Unvaccinated children are at increased risk of acquiring and transmitting vaccine-preventable diseases” (Smith, Chu & Barker, 2004). Here is the argument of whether those children, whose parents decided not to vaccinate them, should be allowed in the same educational institutions that the vaccinated children attend. But this can also be objected to by saying that it is plain discrimination to refuse children their education, to which they have every right, because their parents are cautious vaccinations. Where does the solution lie then?\n\nIn light of all the arguments presented above, I believe it is important to unify certain rules related to vaccination and not make it the prerogative of a particular public or private school to decide whether or not to accept an unvaccinated child. The issue of vaccination is of primary importance due to its direct impact on the quality and duration of the life of every citizen; exposing anybody to unjustified risk of being infected by vaccine-preventable diseases is inhumane. Vaccination has an incredibly long history—it is believed to have already existed in Ancient Greece, China, and Babel (Stern & Markel, 2005). Since it has been around for so long and has been so widespread, I believe it is sound to consider it as an effective medical prevention method.\n\nVaccination today is used all around the world, and there are certain standards that must be observed so that all vaccines remain effective and pose minimum risk. If the person to be vaccinated is not, or has not recently been sick, has a healthy immune system and is vaccinated with a quality product, the risk of having any unwanted consequences is less than 1%. The effectiveness of protection of one’s health as a result of immunization is many times higher, which in my opinion makes the risk justified. Therefore, it would only be right to end all debate by passing a binding country-wide law to make certain vaccines (against those diseases that are widespread in minors, or that may cause serious consequences for one’s health) obligatory. After all, when it comes to health, there is no place for speculation.###"}

As research shows, an active participation in sports has a positive influence on a teenager’s social life, self-esteem, and even academic performance (Sitkowski, 2008). There is no doubt that sports are beneficial for boys and girls, women and men. However, it is perplexing that some 40 years ago, women and girls were close to being virtually deprived of the opportunity to play sports in universities, colleges, high schools and junior high schools. It was not until 1972, when Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendment Act was passed, that women received equal rights to participate in sports at all educational institutions.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the risks and benefits of genetically engineering food?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In our modern era, people have come up with innovative ways of addressing their age-old problems. One of the most recent and controversial inventions in this regard is the engineering of food. Nina Fedoroff, an American professor of biotechnology, presents the debate on genetic modification of food in the article Engineering Food for All (2011). Specifically, she supports the innovation, positing that it plays a critical role in addressing food security in the world. Genetic engineering of food elicits mixed reactions from those on either side of the debate. Central to the argument is the environmental sustainability of technology, human health, and the economy. A closer examination of genetic engineering of food reveals the fallacy of its value. This dangerous technology poses serious risks to the environment, human health, and the overarching economy. Consequently, genetic engineering of food does not positively contribute to food security in the world.\n\nFood engineering does not aid global food security, as it is not sustainable. The engineering of food can cause unintended harm to the environment. Pollen grains from genetically-modified maize kill the larvae of the monarch butterfly, for instance (Conner, Glare & Nap, 24). The indiscriminate killing of insects underlines the environmental unfriendliness of genetic engineering of food crops. Similarly, the use of herbicides results in the indiscriminate killing of plants. Therefore, this technology clearly undermines biodiversity (Freedman, 72). In adopting this technology, we would have to be prepared for enormous technological challenges. Crops designed to resist pesticides would soon see their effectiveness decrease. An appropriate comparison would be mosquito resistance to DDT. In addition, weeds exposed to herbicides would soon become resistant. This would create unnecessary complications that would require the repeated modification of the crops (Conner, Glare & Nap 26).\n\nContrary to the stance of supporters, genetically-modified foods have adverse effects on human health. Mostly, consumers of these foods suffer from allergies and gastrointestinal complications (Freedman 82). The genetic engineering of food involves the inclusion of the genes of organisms that are not part of the human food chain (Freedman, 83). The adoption of this technology would not solve poverty in the world. Instead, the technology widens the gap between the rich and the poor. This is due to the high costs associated with acquiring the inputs required in adopting genetic engineering.\n\nSupporters of the genetic engineering of food, such as Fedoroff, believe this innovation holds the key to sustaining the growing human population. Fedoroff contends that genetic engineering comes at an appropriate time when climatic changes are a common phenomena. To sustain the expanding world population, Fedoroff and other supporters of the technology believe we should turn to adopting genetically-modified food. Central to this appeal is that the engineering of food increases productivity and reduces costs of production. Farmers who have adopted the technology have reported increased yields of “as much as 10 times” (Fedoroff). In addition, the technology is environmentally-friendly. Using herbicides reduces the tendency of tilling land. Therefore, it “decreases soil erosion and shrinks the agricultural footprint” (Fedoroff).\n\nThese claims by the supporters of genetic engineering of food are unrealistic. For instance, the genetic engineering of food is not environmentally-friendly considering its impact on ecosystems. It does not reduce the costs of production in agriculture. With patents in mind, the costs of the inputs in undertaking genetically-engineered foods are certain to be exorbitant. In the long run, reliance on this technology may result in the need for newer technologies to address emergent challenges.\n\nIn addition, those that support the genetic engineering of food contend that it is safe for human consumption. Fedoroff uses the article to disown claims that there are significant dangers associated with genetically-modified foods. Quoting from some research, she contends that products of this technology are “no more dangerous than crop modification by other methods.” However, only some research institutions are responsible for the research that supporters quote. What is notable is the absence of renowned institutions such as the EPA in supporting the health claim. This means the claims that genetically-modified food is safe for human consumption are far-fetched (Freedman, 67). Animosity between the relevant research bodies underlines the sinister motives behind the researchers’ assertion that the technology is healthy.\n\nThe genetic engineering of food does not solve the problem of global food security. There are more risks than benefits associated with this technology. Genetic modification of food would have serious and negative implications for the environment, the economy, and human health. These risks negate the benefit of advancing food security, the main reason for employing the genetic modification of food.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of school uniforms?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The years that we as individuals are in primary school is a testing-ground for the development of our personalities and values. A common occurrence during this phase is individuals vying to look original—to appear different than the ‘crowd.’ Our appearance, clothes, and style is one of the most efficient ways to express our uniqueness. These facets of expression aid others in reaching an understanding of who we are, and why. However, there has been an ongoing debate on whether school uniforms should be abolished in schools, both private and public, or if uniforms should become a compulsory addition to all middle-level educational institutions in the United States (Gregory, Pull House). Despite the friction between the pros and cons, I personally gravitate towards the idea that school uniforms should be introduced in primary public and private schools ubiquitously. Wearing school uniforms does not promote unfair comparisons between students’ incomes in terms of clothing, they aid students in developing their inner qualities instead of focusing on the outer aspects of themselves in the crucial earlier years of their lives, and provides a platform for practicing discipline.\n\nWearing uniforms is a prudent way to diminish the chance of humiliation in a school environment. While most private schools already have established a particular uniform to be worn within the institution at all times by students, public schools mostly remain more liberal and only have a more-or-less strict dress code. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that public schools tend to have a more diverse student population from different cultural backgrounds and socioeconomic statuses (Populus, Generation W). Some students have parents with high incomes who can afford to buy fashionable and costly clothes for their children. But there are also those teens who are forced to buy low-cost outfits at discount retail stores. From this viewpoint, if all students wear identical clothes, a reduction in humiliation will occur in comparison.\n\nAnother point to consider is the way varied clothing detracts teenagers from gaining inner knowledge. Teens tend towards wearing fancy, strange, or colorful clothes (Pep, Style Teen). Some individuals at the age of 16 already have piercings or tattoos. If from an early age, children become conditioned to paying too much attention to the way people dress, instead of looking to enriching their inner being, acquiring new skills and knowledge, we should expect a materialistic and a emotionally-restrained society in the nearest future and even in the present. Wearing a uniform would aid in having students pay more attention to their personalities rather than looks. The main concept behind enforcing a law that would require a nationwide school uniform implementation is that it would aid children in understanding that they should develop their inner beauty and not get involved with unsavory company and fake friends.\n\nAnother benefit of school uniforms is that it teaches children discipline and conformity—qualities that they need to imbibe so that later in life they can abide by complex governmental laws and a plethora of social norms. Though self-expression is undoubtedly important in a democratically-regulated education system, there are also democratic policies that citizens need to follow in order to be respected citizens. Wearing uniforms is a form of conformity that allows students to understand the importance of complying to rules that are a foundation to existing in a nation (Hannah, Where Our Rules Come From).\n\nHaving a nationwide implementation of school uniforms is a solution to the turmoil that many students face when being ridiculed for their looks instead of how bright their personality is. Primary students wearing the same clothes as classmates can help them feel more involved in their educational community and encourage the integration of groups of children of the same age. In addition, the practice of wearing school uniforms demonstrates to students that certain rules must be followed in order to fulfill a normalization of one’s identity in accordance to policies.###"}
