{"prompt":"Explain the problems, both personal and societal, that result from obesity.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A single overweight person might not warrant much attention. But a nation whose population is increasingly obese is cause for concern. In the United States, 14% of children and teenagers are categorized as overweight. Why is this a serious problem instead of simply a matter of personal choice? What are the causes of this constantly increasing percentage of obese persons? What is to be done about this, and what organized steps should be taken to solve the problem?\n\nJust as there are ripples from a stone thrown into the water, there are farreaching and unending effects resulting from obesity. From a psychological perspective, most obese persons would prefer not to be overweight. Our society glorifies the ultra-thin, so if you are obese you do not fit in with acceptable modes of appearance. We know that children are often cruel about taunting their heavy classmates. All too often we hear friends say, “I’ve got to lose weight before that trip,” or “before the wedding.” However, there are more objective measures of the negative results of obesity. Type 2 (adult onset) diabetes, an illness with serious consequences, including damage to the heart, damage to the eyes and difficulty in healing infections is attributed to obesity. Public health agencies are dealing with the continual rise in this type of diabetes. Asthma is also on the rise as a result of the obesity epidemic as are sleep disorders such as sleep apnea. Recent research indicates a relationship between some types of cancer and obesity. Society pays the price when citizens are ill, are unable to work, and require constant medical care.\n\nQuestions arise: “What can be done about this?” “Who or what is to blame?” Discussing blame is a delicate problem. There are undoubtedly overweight individuals with inherited tendencies toward diabetes or heart disease, and there is evidence that a hormone that gives people a sense of fullness after eating may be lacking in some obese people. Yet, knowing that they are at risk would suggest that steps be taken to thwart the onset of the physical consequences of obesity.\n\nMost authorities agree that diet is key. The avoidance of foods high in sugars, carbohydrates, and saturated fats is recommended by most physicians as a way to ward off obesity and its dire consequences. But this is difficult in our society where fast food outlets are ubiquitous, where we are bombarded by advertising of unhealthy foods, and where we lead increasingly sedentary lives. Sugar-laden soft drinks are sold in schools and profits from these sales are high. An elementary school in Los Angeles received $50,000 for allowing Coca-Cola to install its vending machines. This company and Pepsico constitute the majority of the school soft drink market, and while they profit from the present sales, they are also building brand loyalty and creating future habitual soft drink consumers.\n\nLack of adequate exercise is a concomitant contributor to the rise in obesity. Children are often playing video games instead of engaging in sports. Adults watch television instead of exercising. People will drive around shopping centers to avoid walking a few extra steps. The quintessential “couch potato” invention has just been invented. Now you can get a universal remote with which, from your comfortable couch, you can not only control your television, but your oven, lights and, presumably, other things which we can only begin to imagine.\n\nSociety suffers when its population is increasingly unhealthy, has rising medical costs, notes absenteeism from work and school, and has social inequalities. This latter result, social inequalities, reflects the assertion recently made by a school administrator that 50% of children in poorer school districts are obese. Experts seem to believe that obesity is a problem that can, with diligence and desire, be eliminated or at least mitigated with two simple changes in lifestyle—eating more healthily and getting more exercise.###"}
{"prompt":"Describe the purposes of the Internet. Include various viewpoints, including that of users and providers.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In today’s world, the first place people turn to when there is a question to be answered, information to be located, or people to be contacted, is often the Internet. Yes, the Internet may have supplanted the traditional encyclopedia as well as a number of other sources of service and information. We can make reservations, plan vacations, play interactive games, learn a language, listen to music or radio programs, read the newspaper, and find out about a medical condition, without coming face to face with another person. There is no limit to the subject matter you can research on the Internet. Just go to a search engine such as Yahoo or Google, type in a few key words or a Web address, and presto, you will probably summon links to more sources than you could have imagined. The Internet allows you to remain at your computer and shop no matter what you wish to purchase. And if you are looking for a bargain or an unusual item, you can go to a popular auction site and either sell or buy.\n\nIf, however, you do wish to speak directly to a person, there are the chat rooms. On practically any given topic, groups of people converse with each other. They may be giving opinions about a perfect travel itinerary, a book, or even a political party. The most prevalent use of the Internet also involves directly writing to a person, and that is the sending of e-mail messages to friends and associates. It is possible to communicate instantly with anyone, anywhere, as long as there is an Internet connection. In a world where people frequently travel, where families do not necessarily live in the same neighborhoods, e-mail is a means of making simple, inexpensive, immediate contact. Not only do we send verbal messages, but also now digital cameras take pictures that can be stored and then instantly transmitted on the Internet.\n\nUnfortunately, there are individuals who subvert the opportunities offered by this technology. They are less than honest, disguise their identity, bilk people in financial scams, and entice unsuspecting people, including children, into giving them personal information. Caveats about these problems are currently being publicized so those Internet users will not be victimized.\n\nOf course, the Internet providers, such as AOL, hope to make a profit, and there is usually a monthly fee for the hookup. To increase the profits, the providers sell advertising, which may pop up on the subscriber’s screen and require the user to stop and respond, either positively or negatively, to the ads.\n\nWhen you consider that, among other things, you can hear a concert, read a book, visit a museum and view its contents, visit the websites of numerous individuals and organizations, play a game with one or more people, and pay your bills, you will realize that the uses of the Internet are too vast for a short list. Most would agree that much has been added to peoples’ lives by connecting them to the Internet, and that we probably cannot anticipate what new purposes will be explored in the future.###"}
{"prompt":"Describe various styles of shoes as well as reasons for their popularity.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" ###"}
{"prompt":"Visit the shoe department of a large department store and you will undoubtedly see a variety of shoe styles on display. This suggests that the store is satisfying the customers’ desire for an assortment of shoes.\n\nLogically, shoes should protect and support the feet. An example of such a shoe is the sneaker. Originally an inexpensive canvas, rubber soled version of a leather oxford (a shoe with laces), the sneaker has become increasing popular and has supplanted the oxford for regular everyday use for many students and some adults. Sneakers, like living things, have evolved and branched out. They are now mostly made of leather and have much cushioning to minimize stress on the wearer’s joints. They have become specialized into separate sneakers for walking, running, tennis, and basketball. There are sneakers for aerobic classes, and for the eclectic exerciser, there are cross trainers. There is justification for their popularity for they are comfortable and are engineered to properly support the foot during a particular activity. It has also become acceptable to wear sneakers with street clothes because they just plain feel good. An endorsement by a popular athlete spreads their appeal as well as increases their cost.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum is a shoe style that is uncomfortable, harmful, and impractical. These adjectives describe the women’s shoes with pointed toes and thin, high heels. Doctors say that the pointed toes cause deformities of the feet, and the three to four inch heels are unstable and can cause back problems. With so many negatives, why are these styles consistently popular? Wearers may admit that they are uncomfortable, but say that they are fashionable and that, in time, they get used to them. Historically, people follow fashion, and here again, advertising preys upon this need to keep up with the current trends.\n\nA shoe that can be totally practical, simply fashionable, or a combination of both, is the boot. For cold or inclement weather, no footwear is as desirable as an insulated, rubber-soled boot. Boots are popular because they are practical, long lasting, and a desirable fashion accessory. But there are boots whose entire function is fashion. Yes, these boots have the same pointed toes and spiked heels as the shoes described above, but they are boots because the leather continues high on the leg.\n\nHistorically, shoe styles change, but there are some shoes that are comfortable as well as fashionable, like sandals and sneakers. And, there are those styles some would consider fashionable but harmful to the feet, or worse. If the choice were between comfort or fashion, many people would probably risk discomfort in order to be fashionable.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" ###"}
{"prompt":"Math is a required subject. Explain why it is so important.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If you complain about the universality of math as a required subject, just try and spend one day without encountering some form of mathematics. From page numbers to prices to today’s date, math puts things in order and enables us to compare quantitatively. Figuring how much time is required, how much of an ingredient must be measured, how much carpet to buy, all of these everyday experiences require familiarity with math. To survive financially you must use math to allocate your resources. If you want to invest in a business or in the stock market you must know how to deal with the numbers. Understanding graphs and other analyses about the economy or politics or consumer confidence are enhanced by the applications of math. Mathematical applications in the study of science are essential. Tracking the orbits of planets and the locations of stars in the galaxy cannot be done without numerical comparisons. Every discipline, from archeology to zoology, benefits in some way from the use of mathematics.\n\nPractical reasons for the need for mathematics are omnipresent, but there are other, perhaps more esoteric reasons, for interest in this subject. The amazing coincidences found in numbers provide continual fascination. An example is the fact that the sum of the numbers in the products of the “9-times table” add up to nine. Nine times five equals forty-five, and four plus five equals nine. Similarly, the numbers in the product of seven times nine also equal nine. Mathematicians are also especially fascinated with unique geometric relationships. An example is the fact that three pyramids of the same height will exactly fit into a prism of equal height.\n\nA teacher of mathematics once told me, “Math is in everything,” and some people say, “Mathematics is the something for which the world was written.” These are reasons enough for requiring its study.###"}
{"prompt":"Describe a major environmental problem and what you believe should be done about it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A major environmental problem, the magnitude of which we are just beginning to realize, is global warming. When people say that the winters aren’t as cold as they used to be, or that there was definitely more snow in past years, they are correct. In addition to these personal testimonials, there is concrete visual evidence of global warming. Most noticeable is the depletion of the ice caps. In recent years, glaciers have been receding in greater amounts than in former years. One only has to visit a national park where this recession is marked with signs indicating where the glacier reached in a particular year. The visitor can see how much further away from a particular spot the ice is at the present moment.\n\nWhen the ice caps, made of fresh water, melt, they change the salinity of the oceans, change the currents, and change the conditions for survival for myriad species. Additionally, invasive species might move in, affecting the entire ecosystem. This has a domino effect, as all species are interdependent and survive according to predictable sources of food and living conditions. A specific example recently described on an environmental calendar told of the effect of global warming on polar bears. The bears cannot go out on the melted ice, which is how they get their food. This causes them to lose body fat and even to be unable to give birth to cubs.\n\nGlobal warming causes flooding, and because the warming of the earth causes dryness, fires increase.\n\nWhen speaking of the causes of global warming, some experts say that ice ages followed by warming have been cyclical throughout the eons and that there is not much that can be done about it. However, most scientists believe that the actions of humans have speeded up this process. They blame the increased burning of wood and fossil fuels—oil and coal—on an increasing population needing heat for warmth and cooking. More energy consumption places carbon dioxide and other pollutants in the atmosphere. Warm air trapped around the earth has been deemed the greenhouse effect.\n\nWhile we cannot stop the naturally occurring climate changes, we can try to mitigate the rapid warming by reducing our use of fossil fuels. Much publicity has been given to the love that Americans have for sports utility vehicles which burn an inordinate amount of fuel and which are not required for the kind of ordinary driving done by most owners. There are numerous additional ways in which we can reduce our dependence on these fuels, ranging from insulating our homes, to lowering the thermostat in winter, and raising it when we use air conditioning. Perhaps researchers can develop alternate sources of energy. Presently an automobile is being developed that uses gas initially and then automatically switches to electricity. Theoretically, this car will be able to run for fifty miles on one gallon of gasoline. Additionally, we can support the scientific study of the effects of global warming. Perhaps we can predict such things as where floods will occur or where crops will have difficulty surviving and take steps to overcome these problems.\n\nOne thing is certain. Global warming is a serious environmental problem with ramifications that affect almost every aspect of life.###"}
{"prompt":"Describe how communication has changed in the last twenty years.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Who could have predicted twenty years ago that communication would change as radically as it has? Today, communication is instantaneous. No longer do we have to use a pen, pencil, or typewriter to write a letter. No longer do we have to use a postal service to mail it. No longer do we have to wait for a response that takes several days. Nor do we have to stay near a telephone or search for a public phone while traveling. Things have speeded up exponentially.\n\nIn the last twenty years we have benefited from tremendous changes in telecommunication. The relatively simple change to portable phones enabled us to roam around the house while chatting, not limited by the length of the cord that attaches the receiver to the base of the telephone. Then came the beeper, allowing us to get a message when away from a telephone. Now, of course, there is the ubiquitous cell phone. Watch the crowds walking along a sidewalk, and you can’t help noticing people purposefully striding along while talking on their cell phones.\n\nWhat if we must write a message? We now have e-mail. We send these messages immediately after typing them on the computer keyboard and never have to go to the Post Office. No more “snail mail.” Perhaps we have a written copy that must be sent but cannot be conveniently sent via the computer. Simply dial a phone number, push a few buttons, send a FAX. The copy is transmitted to the receiver at once. The ability to telecommute is almost like handing the copy to the recipient. What a difference twenty years has made. Just as most of us could not imagine the speed and ease of communication in the twenty-first century, we probably cannot anticipate the changes that will occur in the next twenty years. Perhaps we will be able to send instant messages simply by thinking about them, from one brain to the brain of the intended recipient.###"}
{"prompt":"Discuss the events in the life of your favorite author, sports figure, or performer. Explain how these events relate to the person’s achievements.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Herman Melville was a 19th century writer whose works foreshadowed themes that would become prevalent in the 20th century. He wrote about his distaste for the prevalent oppression of underlings, of the need to accept different cultures and to appreciate the contributions of ordinary people. His novels probe into psychological reasons for characters’ actions in a way that would be relevant today.\n\nBorn into a New York family that was prominent, although in constant debt, Melville was forced to end his formal schooling at the age of twelve. He was nevertheless widely read and informed on numerous subjects, including, but not limited to, literature, art, science, biology, navigation, mythology, and geography. Thus, he was largely self-educated, as was Ishmael, the narrator of Moby Dick, Melville’s most acclaimed novel. Ishmael said, “A whale ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.”\n\nJust as Ishmael’s experiential education mirrored Melville’s own informal schooling, so were many other aspects of his life reflected in his writings. Signing up as a cabin boy on a ship going to Liverpool, England, when he was 20, provided Melville with material for the novel, Redburn. The novel was about a lonely 20-year old orphan wandering around Liverpool and is thought to be the writer’s most autobiographical.\n\nMotivated by the need to earn money, Melville signed up for a four-year voyage as a common seaman in spite of the fact that his family connections could have easily gotten him an officer’s commission. Melville had a progressive view about equality that was unusual for his time. He believed in the dignity of all work, which was reflected in his sympathetic, even admiring, excruciatingly detailed, descriptions of the jobs of the working people in his writings. He decried nationalistic prejudice and believed that all people are related. He wrote, “You cannot shed a drop of American blood without shedding blood of the whole world.”\n\nAmong the first white men to explore the South Sea Islands, Melville was surely the first literary artist to do so. Unable to bear the inhumane treatment on this long voyage, he deserted in the Marquesas Islands. He was ill and fortunately was cared for by a kindly native family. A grown son in the family was covered with tattoos, and Melville learned that these people were cannibals who feasted on their enemies. In order to leave, he had to escape, finding refuge on an Australian ship. He deserted from this ship also, landing in Tahiti. These experiences provided material for the novel Typee, about the South Sea Islands, the novel Omoo, based upon his experiences in Tahiti, and the novel White Jacket, which exposed the cruelty of navy flogging. The tattooed man who cared for Melville provided the prototype for Quequeg, one of the most memorable characters in literature.\n\nHerman Melville also was a crewmember of a whaling voyage where he learned the intricacies involved in this type of multi-year voyage that he used as the setting for Moby Dick. This novel, considered a literary masterpiece, provided a forum for Melville’s ideas about the necessity for connectedness. The savage, Quequeg, and the sailor, Ishmael, were mutually supportive of this theme. In addition, Melville was a great believer in democracy and the benefits of diversity, and these beliefs were reflected in his descriptions of the crew on the whaling voyage. The ship was a metaphor for the world, with its crew coming from every known location and background, all being necessary for success. A monomaniacal captain, devoid of empathy, driven by his selfish aims, and unable to connect with others, could only lead to disaster.\n\nThus, Herman Melville’s real-life experiences undoubtedly made possible his descriptive novels, but they would not have been possible without his independently drawn conclusions about the dignity of man and his place in the universe.###"}
{"prompt":"Explain the causes and effects of not voting in elections.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Voting is the privilege for which wars have been fought, protests have been organized, and editorials have been written. “No taxation without representation,” was a battle cry of the American Revolution. Women struggled for suffrage as did all minorities. Eighteen year olds clamored for the right to vote, saying that if they were old enough to go to war, they should be allowed to vote. Yet Americans have a deplorable voting history.\n\nInterviewing people about their voting habits is revealing. There are individuals who state, almost boastfully, that they have never voted. They somehow set themselves apart from the requirements of citizenship in a democracy. Many who avoid voting do so consciously. It is not as if they were ill or unavoidably detained on election day. Often they claim that their one vote doesn’t matter. “What’s one vote?” they ask. Perhaps one vote may not count in some elections, although there have been results determined by one or very few votes. In addition, the total of single votes that are not cast can add up to a significant difference in a particular race. Some people blame the fact that they do not know enough about the issues for their absence from the voting booth. Others say that they avoid learning about the news because it is too depressing. In a democracy, we can express our opinions to our elected leaders, but more than half of us sometimes avoid choosing these people who make the policies that affect our lives.\n\nOne of the effects of this statistic is that politicians will cater to the groups that do vote in large numbers, giving more weight to their needs than to those of other groups or of the general population. Since so many do not vote, elected officials can, with impunity, promote policies that benefit the special interests that contribute financially to the election campaigns. Another effect of not voting is the free rein given to those in office to disregard the expressed opinions of constituents. For if you do not vote, why should the candidate worry about you?\n\nIt seems ironic that in this most democratic of societies, we abrogate the privilege for which so many have struggled. How many countries do not have a choice of candidates, yet their citizens are forced to participate in sham elections? In the United States we have choices. We can vote to fire an officeholder who does not live up to our expectations by choosing an opponent at the next election, and we are free to choose someone whose ideas appeal to us.\n\nPerhaps a major reason for not voting is the failure to convey how precious and unique is the right to vote and how important is each and every vote. The major effect is that we are voluntarily giving up our rights as citizens to ascertain that our elected officials truly represent us. This is because we have not done our part in choosing them so in effect, we are telling these officials that we don’t care enough to bother to vote.###"}
{"prompt":"Explain how to have a winning baseball team.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Whether professional or amateur, a baseball team, like a fine meal, needs the right ingredients to create a winning result. Talented athletes are the first requirement. After that, astute coaching, which discerns and then develops the unique capabilities of the players, can be as important as the athletes themselves. Flexibility and the willingness to try different strategies are the hallmarks of winning coaches. All the talent in the world could be wasted without creative and shrewd coaching.\n\nA player with the ability to sprint, needed both for infield defense and for speedy base running, can be invaluable. A fast runner can steal bases and get to first base with a carefully placed bunt.\n\nGood pitching is essential for a winning baseball team. A pitcher who is “on” is the first line of defense in baseball. It is well known that the pitcher is often the poorest hitter, but it is the pitcher who keeps the opponents from scoring. The pitcher’s teammates accept this and acknowledge that it is their job to score the runs. Here again, a good coach decides who is the optimum pitcher for today’s game, and equally important, when to take a tired or poorly performing pitcher out of the game.\n\nRecruiting strong and consistent batters will be a factor in creating a winning baseball team. Having a home run hitter with several players who can be counted on to get base hits and pinch hits are needed because the best pitching and the best fielding will be for naught if runs aren’t scored.\n\nEven with a plethora of natural ability, to become a winning baseball team, the players must continually practice, not only to maintain their skills, but also to improve them. In fact, a motivated player who practices diligently may eventually surpass those with superior natural ability that is not developed. Along with this desire to continually improve one’s individual playing ability, there is the motivation to succeed because of loyalty to the group. This type of esprit de corps can make the difference between a good and a winning baseball team. Putting the team first, while striving to give one’s all, puts the finishing touches on the recipe \n\nA winning baseball team would need good hitters, fast runners, a skilled pitcher and catcher, and a knowledgable and patient coach. It would also need to have a group of players who got along without any jealousy or hostility and were capable of rooting for each other.\n\nGood hitters and runners are important because you have to get alot of hits and runs to win. You can’t win without scoring runs. Also, the runners need to be speedy, so they can get to the base before the ball gets there. You also have to have a skilled pitcher who can strike people out. The pitcher has to be good or else the other team will score more runs and you will lose. The catcher is important as well because if the catcher drops the ball when the pitcher throws it, that is an error.\n\nFinally, you also need to have a good coach who can help the players improve and who knows when to put certain players in the game and when to take them out. The coach should keep the team running smoothly and solve any fights or disagreements.###"}
{"prompt":"Explain how to choose the right college.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One of the most important decisions young adults make is where to go to school. Your college education will affect the rest of your life, so you should weigh your options carefully. The “perfect” school may not exist, but I believe there are three factors that are integral to choosing the right college: location, size, and curriculum. You can narrow down your search based on these criteria.\n\nFirst, you should consider location. Some questions you should ask yourself include: Do I prefer to live in a city, the suburbs, or a rural area? Do I want to live in a temperate or colder climate? Do I prefer to be near my family, or in another part of the country? The answers to these questions will help you make the best choice.\n\nSecond, you should consider size. Perhaps your high school experience will affect your choice of colleges. If you attended a small high school with a low teacher-student ratio, you may be accustomed to small class sizes and knowing your fellow students extremely well. On the other hand, if you attended a large high school, you may be used to new faces and larger classes. Would you prefer a school such as UCSB with 50,000 students, or a smaller school with fewer than 5,000 students? Remember, the attention you receive will be affected by the size of the student population.\n\nFinally, in order to choose the right college, you should take the time to decide what you would like to study. Although most colleges offer a myriad of courses, some schools specialize in certain fields and subjects or offer a wider selection of classes. For example, if you are interested in studying the Classics, did you know that the University of Texas has one of the best Classics departments in the United States?\n\nChoosing the right college will require some effort. After you have decided the location, size, and curriculum you prefer, do some research. Learn about different colleges from your guidance counselor, the Internet, or from the colleges themselves. As with any important decision, make sure your choice is an educated one.###"}
{"prompt":"Your new job requires that you move to a different city. Describe the steps you will take to prepare for this move.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Although Americans move more than most people in the world, a move is acknowledged to be one of life’s more stressful experiences. There are, however, steps that can be taken and preparations that can be made which will mitigate the inevitable strain.\n\nIf I were to move to a different city because of a job change, I would find a sponsor in the new location, preferably someone who could give me insight into the kind of situation I could expect at the workplace and about the cultural and other differences in the new community. Different cities may be diverse in many ways: in ideas about appropriate behavior, in social expectations, and even in emotional reactions. If the city had special sites or events to generate civic pride, I would like to investigate those. Or there may be popular gathering places such as parks or cafés. This knowledge would be helpful in getting to understand the attitudes of the residents and to become part of the community.\n\nSpending time with a realtor would be a necessity, not only for finding a satisfactory residence, but also for gaining information about different neighborhoods, schools, libraries, and other community resources. In fact, it would be worthwhile to take the time to deliberately explore the community by walking or driving around.\n\nMy family members are interested in horses, sailing, and playing bridge. As a way to find out how we can pursue these interests and find people similarly inclined, we could visit stables, marinas, or social clubs. Striking up a conversation with people in these places and telling them that I am moving shortly would create a more knowledgeable transition. In addition to picking the brains of people, there may be published material, such as maps and guidebooks, that could be informative. The same is true of Internet sites.\n\nAll this preparation cannot eliminate the probability that leaving my friends, seeing my belongings picked up, packed, and moved to a different city, and facing new routines and new surroundings will be somewhat traumatic. However, visualizing daily life in the new city can help make the move easier and the transition smoother.###"}
{"prompt":"Many people spend a great deal of time with animals. Write about the relationships that people have with animals.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Since they were first domesticated, people have had relationships with animals that have enhanced their lives. Probably animals that were trained to hunt and to retrieve prey were among the first to become valuable to their owners. Useful animals include those used for transportation, for hauling loads, and, in recent times, to assist handicapped people. The latter are usually dogs trained to guide the blind and to care for paraplegics. Although these animals have specific functions, it is probable that a special bond inevitably arises between them and the humans they serve and this goes far beyond the dependency each has for the other.\n\nCan a relationship with an animal improve a person’s health? Many recent reports seem to suggest this possibility. Pets give us abundant and unconditional love. Always happy to see us, our pets allow us to be ourselves, to talk to them, and even to believe that they understand us. When we come home, we might feel reluctant to “talk to ourselves,” but it is perfectly all right to greet, chat, and interact with our dog, cat, bird, and even our fish. Some mental health workers are so insistent upon the beneficial influences of pets that they have an animal present during therapy sessions, claiming that this causes patients to be more relaxed and responsive. Studies have proven that relationships with animals reduce stress and actually can measurably lower blood pressure.\n\nFor people who are depressed or living alone, having a pet is not only therapeutic; it is a means of encouraging a healthier lifestyle. A pet owner must live according to a regular timetable so that the pet can be fed and cared for appropriately. For dog owners, there is an additional social benefit that accrues from having to go outdoors for a walk. Encountering other dog walkers often leads to further social interaction and, perhaps, friendship. For cat owners, there is the admiration for the cat’s characteristic independence, which makes any affection from the cat so much more meaningful. Keeping the bird feeders filled gives a sense of satisfying the needs of creatures that, in turn, delight us with their beauty and their antics.\n\nOther beneficial effects of relationships with animals continue to be discovered. A recent article suggests that kindness to people and animals may be interconnected. Role-playing that increases children’s empathy for animals helps them not only psychologically, but also physically and socially. Another discovery shows that riding horses, for reasons not completely understood, has been shown to benefit autistic children. Pet owners can now volunteer to take their pets to hospitals and nursing homes where residents seem to welcome them.\n\nIt is probable that continued research will shed additional light on what happens when people and animals form a bond. For the present, it is certain that almost anyone can benefit from the resulting security, understanding, fun, laughter, and love that come from having a pet.###"}
{"prompt":"Describe an especially memorable photo or picture.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You might think a memorable picture would have vivid color, an appealing or inspirational theme, or be something you might want to display and look at every day. That is not the case with the picture that is most memorable to me. This picture is really a large mural, painted in 1937 by the Spanish artist, Pablo Picasso, to protest the bombing of a small village in northern Spain.\n\nSurprisingly, there is no vivid red color to show the flowing blood. One must imagine this, for the mural is startlingly gray, black, and white. But there is no avoiding the horror of the images. The figures are not realistically drawn, but are cubist and abstract, and it is apparent that innocent civilians are being slaughtered. A mother screams with her mouth wide open, her head tipped back in heart-rending anguish, as she holds her dead baby. A soldier lies dead on the ground, clutching his broken sword, and three other people are shown in shock and agony. Animals, including a tortured horse and a crying bird, are also portrayed as innocent victims of a massacre. Some symbols are open to interpretation. What is the meaning of the bull, which seems simply to be observing, or of the light bulb emitting rays at the top of the mural? Does the bull symbolize brute force, and does the light bulb signify that there is hope? Yet there is no doubt that the distorted, horrible images are intended to shock the viewer. This depiction of human grief is a profound statement of the cruelty and senselessness of war. Limiting the pictures to black and white adds a funereal element to the shocking depiction of the catastrophe.\n\nThe memory of the picture cannot be forgotten; it is a metaphor for the senselessness and the horror of war. While it was painted to protest atrocities in a long ago war, it is as relevant today as the recollection of the horrors of September 11th. Perhaps it should be shown to all those who contemplate starting a war. Would it be worth it to have another Guernica?###"}

As suggested, Internet sites were used in addition to first-person accounts and editorial material.\n\nAlthough I spent an inordinate amount of time on this project , I felt it to be most worthwhile because it was a wonderful learning experience. When I saw the grade on the paper, I looked in vain for comments or suggestions. It would be helpful to me if I understood how you arrived at this grade. Would it be possible for us to arrange a meeting, during which time you could offer hints about what you felt was lacking in my work, and, perhaps, I could hope that you might reconsider and raise my grade.\n\nThank you for your kind consideration of this request.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nYour Student###"}
{"prompt":"You want to organize a family reunion. Describe the steps you will take to contact people and to organize the event.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" My family is united genetically but not by proximity. We live in far-flung locations, including three continents and both the northern and southern hemispheres. Some of us have kept in touch while others might as well be considered MIA. It would seem close to impossible to organize a family reunion for such a peripatetic group. Yet, that is what I decided to attempt.\n\nInitially I sent e-mails to all those I regularly heard from and requested any and all addresses of other relatives to be forwarded to me. South Africa was the farthest location and was the source of some previously unknown addresses. Internet searches yielded still more. How delighted I was that there seemed to be universal interest in the project. Several people volunteered to help. We generated a list and added to it as soon as we received further information.\n\nRelatives were located in Alaska, Canada, and six states. Thus the first big hurdle was overcome: the list of potential invitees. Then, with solicited input from all concerned, it was decided to choose a location near New York, the original point of origin of the family.\n\nIt then became necessary to choose a site for the get-together and then to find accommodations for approximately fifty-five people ranging in age from under one year to eighty-five. An all-suite hotel, which agreed to charge reduced rates if a minimum number of reservations were confirmed was selected. The hotel agreed to hold rooms for us until two weeks prior to the weekend of the get-together. A list of nearby motels and bed and breakfasts was also compiled. We now had the who, where, and when, the latter being the last weekend in September when the weather was still moderate and travel not likely to be a problem. Why we were getting together seemed obvious. There was curiosity to catch up, and even to meet relatives known only by reputation.\n\nNow we came to the question of how the weekend would be organized. Since most people would be arriving on Friday, that day was to be relaxed and unstructured. On Saturday, there would be games and an informal picnic lunch in a nearby county park, the permission for which was easily obtained. Saturday night would be the highlight, a catered dinner in a restaurant which could easily hold a group of this size. People had been asked to bring photos and anecdotes and a list of speakers was generated. The youngest members would be introduced and those traveling great distances would be recognized. The oldest members might wish to share their reminiscences. Sunday would again be an informal day, probably punctuated with hugs, the sharing of addresses, and promises to do this again. All of the activities would be recorded on videos and a digital camera so that they could easily be forwarded via e-mail. Thus the planning for a family reunion must begin well in advance of the date. Planners must seek out addresses of the relatives, must settle on a location, a date, and, of course, a place to stay. These would vary according to the size and needs of the group. Some groups might prefer to simply chat informally while others would appreciate planned activities. Once a family has done this, a second reunion would be much easier. The addresses are known, faces can be associated with names, and an evaluation of the previous schedule can be solicited. One caveat: have alternate plans in case of bad weather.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the scientific basis for the soul?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" We often think of ourselves as our body, mind, and emotions. We take these three elements and make an amalgamation. However, we also often talk about a person’s soul. Is there any scientific basis for the soul? Surprisingly, there is. Each unique personality a person has (even in circumstances of amnesia and other illnesses), the feeling and identity of the self beyond age (especially experienced as we grow older), and our inevitable subjective experience as an individual comprise a scientific foundation for the soul.\n\nDespite neuroplasticity, or the constant shift in the links between our brain cells, we remain essentially the same personality. This consistency is most stark in the case of mentally ill patients or people who have experienced memory loss. According to Scientific American:\n\nIn his book The Perpetual Now: A Story of Amnesia, Memory and Love, science journalist Michael Lemonick tells the story of Lonni Sue, a commercial artist who suffered brain damage as a result of a viral infection. She was left unable to recall her past or to form new memories. Hence the book’s title. Lemonick assumed that Lonni Sue, when she lost her memories, lost her self. Because what are we but our memories? But once he got to know Lonni Sue, as well as people who knew her before and after her injury, Lemonick discovered that her self had not been destroyed. She was still cheerful in a way that made people around her feel better, and she was still creative and playful, drawing pictures crammed with visual and verbal puns. (Horgan, John)\n\nSo, despite memory loss, we still retain the essence of our personality. Basically, no matter what happens to our brain, our unique personality seems to shine through.\n\nBesides one’s personality being present despite memory loss, the soul of a person can be identified through one’s consciousness. Though we commonly identify with our body and what we see in the mirror, we also have a sense that we are not a certain age—as our sense of self usually leans less on age and rather on our subjective feeling of who we are in essence. As author Cate Montana explains:\n\nYes, my body is definitely older. But “I” am not. The essence that I call my “self” has not aged a day. Of course, anybody over forty knows this phenomenon. At some point every human being on the planet looks in the mirror and says, “I can’t believe I’m 42 (or 62 or 74 or 87 or…). I’m the exact same person on the inside. What the hell happened?” (“Proof of the Soul.”)\n\nSo, we have an identity that is more of a physical manifestation, and another identity that encapsulates our character. Often, behaviorally, people see their character as eternal rather than bound by age.\n\nLastly, each person is inevitably subjective about his or her experience. Despite humans being very, very similar to each other in DNA and overall composition, our perception of reality is vastly different from individual to individual. According to Psychology Today, “While neuroscience has made tremendous progress illuminating the functioning of the brain, why we have a subjective experience remains mysterious. The problem of the soul lies exactly here, in understanding the nature of the self, the “I” in existence that feels and lives life. Although the current scientific paradigm is based on the belief that the world has an objective observer-independent existence, real experiments suggest just the opposite” (“Does The Soul Exist? Evidence Says ‘Yes’”). As the two-slit experiment has shown, when existence is observed, it changes its composition. This is only one piece of the puzzle that shows how “objective” reality is not easy to come by.\n\nThe soul of a person is incredibly challenging to prove scientifically. However, with each person’s personality being unique, the behavioral quality of thinking of the self beyond age, and our inevitable subjective experience, we can say that the soul has some basis in science. These realities of our behavior, character, and perception might not be tested stringently, but they are very difficult to deny.###"}
{"prompt":"How can I get rid of my stretch marks?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Having stretch marks can lower the self esteem of people. It is often seen as something ugly, or at least unaesthetic. That is why countless people type in “how to get rid of stretch marks” in internet search engines to discover how to solve this issue. In this essay, we will focus on practical ways of making stretch marks disappear by various methods: consuming more Vitamin A, using a sugar scrub, employing aloe vera, taking hyaluronic acid through capsules, and applying coconut oil.\n\nGetting stretch marks out by consuming vitamin A seems like a stretch, but it is a home remedy that is trusted. In fact, a lot of issues we have can be solved by the intake of more vitamins. According to Healthline, “Vitamin A is referred to as a retinoid. Retinoids make skin appear smoother and more youthful. They’re used in many over-the-counter topical cosmetic creams. Simply using a topical extract of vitamin A, or taking vitamin A orally, can contribute to your skin’s health and overall appearance” (“5 Home Remedies for Stretch Marks”). Therefore, you should be on the lookout for products and foods that contain ample amounts of Vitamin A to make your skin return back to normal.\n\nAnother surprise is that sugar can aid in getting rid of stretch marks. Though this substance is usually thought of as something harmful to our health, using a sugar scrub on the marks can be of great benefit. According to Perfect Body Mate, “Mix two tablespoons of natural white sugar with some almond oil. 1. Apply it on areas of stretch marks for a few minutes. 2. Let your skin absorb for 5 minutes. 3. Rinse it off with warm water or take a warm shower. Continue this for at least a month to see your stretch marks fade away” (“17 Simple Ways to Get Rid of Stretch Marks (Fast)”). Sugar has great exfoliating properties that should not be missed when trying to remove your stretch marks.\n\nAnother natural remedy for stretch marks is aloe vera. There are so many choices for consuming aloe vera in the form of drinks, capsules, and of course from the plant itself. As stated by Healthline, “While little clinical evidence exists for aloe vera as a stretch mark cure, pure aloe vera is both a natural healing agent and a skin softener. This makes it an ideal home remedy to try for stretch marks. Apply pure aloe vera from a plant to your stretch marks daily after your shower” (“5 Home Remedies for Stretch Marks”). Since there has not been so much testing on the direct relationship between aloe vera and the removal stretch marks, it is best to combine this method with another one.\n\nThe next aid sounds a bit technical, but research has shown that hyaluronic acid can help reduce stretch marks and even prevent them. It has more evidence that aloe vera as a solution. According to The American Academy of Dermatology, “In two large studies, applying hyaluronic acid to early stretch marks made the stretch marks less noticeable. Researchers have found that products containing centella or hyaluronic acid may help prevent stretch marks. Centella is an herb, and our skin naturally contains hyaluronic acid” (“Stretch Marks: Why They Appear and How to Get Rid of Them”). So, this compound might be the most scientifically proven way of removing stretch marks.\n\nA home remedy that has been popular for a variety of skin issues for eons is coconut oil. According to Healthline, “Since stretch marks are scarring from skin damage, coconut oil might help heal the appearance quickly. Coconut oil has been studied for its healing properties and was found in rats to reduce the time it takes for skin wounds to heal. Applying virgin coconut oil to your stretch marks each day might take away some of their red appearance” (“5 Home Remedies for Stretch Marks). It is a safe and natural aid for getting rid of stretch marks.\n\nAll of these solutions are readily available to people to remove stretch marks: taking Vitamin A, employing a sugar scrub, using aloe vera, ingesting hyaluronic acid through capsules, and using coconut oil. All these methods and more are viable, but it is best to check with your doctor about the best ones according to your condition, allergies, and medical past.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the theories about when Jesus Christ was born?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Jesus Christ is one of the most popular figures of history and religion. Though the historical evidence of him living is not so substantial, there is enough data to claim he was a real person. However, with his existence assured by information outside the Bible, there are still many mysteries about him. One such conundrum is when he was born. In fact, “when was Jesus born” is a top search on the internet. There are many theories about when he was born in terms of the year and month, and even day. These theories have been clouded by popular myths, cultural norms, and a lack of concrete evidence. However, this essay will delve into the various theories behind his birthdate and try to get to the bottom of the question.\n\nThough most people celebrate the birth of Christ on December 25th in the form of Christmas, most scholars agree that this is not the date he was born. In fact, as stated by History.com, “The oldest existing record of a Christmas celebration is found in a Roman almanac that tells of a Christ’s Nativity festival led by the church of Rome in 336 A.D. The precise reason why Christmas came to be celebrated on December 25 remains obscure, but most researchers believe that Christmas originated as a Christian substitute for pagan celebrations of the winter solstice” (“Christ Is Born?”). So, celebrating his birth on December 25th was more of an adaptation to pagan rituals rather than an adherence to an exact date.\n\nSome scholars look at the Bible for evidence of when he was born. For instance, LiveScience states that, “Some scholars think that he was born between 6 B.C. and 4 B.C., based partly on the biblical story of Herod the Great. Not long before Herod’s demise, which is believed to have occurred in 4 B.C., the ruler of Judea supposedly ordered the death of all male infants who were under the age of two and lived in the vicinity of Bethlehem, in an attempt to kill Jesus. But historians disagree about Herod’s actual year of death” (Castro, Joseph). Also, scholars generally assume the mass infanticide described in the Bible to be a legend rather a historical fact. In addition, the Star of Bethlehem expounded on in the Bible appearing on the day Jesus was born is sometimes connected to an astronomical event that happened on 5 B.C. that was noted by Chinese astronomers as a slow moving comet (Castro, Joseph). As a side note, some Bible scholars believe Christ was born in the spring or summer due to shepherds watching over their flocks as stated in the Bible, which would not have happened in winter.\n\nSurprisingly, even computer models have been used to calculate the year of Jesus’ birth date based on astronomy. According to LiveScience, “In 2008, astronomer Dave Reneke argued that Jesus was born in the summer. The Star of Bethlehem, Reneke told New Scientist, may have been Venus and Jupiter coming together to form a bright light in the sky. Using computer models, Reneke determined that this rare event occurred on June 17, in the year 2 B.C.” (Castro, Joseph). However, opposite assumptions have been made by scientists, by placing Jesus’ birth in autumn with a rare astronomical event happening at 7 B.C.\n\nFinally, it is generally believed, with some doubts about its accuracy, that the Roman empire took a census during the time of Jesus’ life. This census was mentioned in the Bible, though it seems there might be errors in terms of dates mentioned. Anyways, if there were a census during Jesus’ life, then there is some evidence for the approximate time he was born. According to GotQuestions.org, “Quirinius governed Syria during this same time period, with records of a census that included Judea in approximately 6 B.C. Some scholars debate whether this is the census mentioned by Luke, but it does appear to be the same event. Based on these historical details, the most likely time of Christ’s birth in Bethlehem is 6-5 B.C.” (“What Year Was Jesus Christ Born?”). Thus, with some help from historical records, we can place Jesus’ date of birth as quite close to the start of the A.D. timeline.\n\nThough we cannot be certain about Jesus’ time of birth, most scholars assume through historical records, the Bible, and astronomy that he was born around the time of 1 AD in either the summer or spring. There are a multitude of theories, despite the lack of evidence that we have. And because of this, there might always be uncertainty about Jesus’ date and time of birth.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the most important events in Canada's history?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Canada is a revered country in the North American continent for its friendly people, peaceful politics, spectacular wildlife, and much more. However, for people who live outside this country (second largest in terms of area), the history of this nation may not be known or understood. In order to understand how Canada became the country it is now, an overview will be given.\n\nCanada has gone through a long history before its Constitution was patriated in 1982. In fact, it begins with the pre-contact aboriginal timeline. According to Britannica.com, “North America’s first humans migrated from Asia, presumably over a now-submerged land bridge from Siberia to Alaska sometime about 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age; it has also been argued, however, that some people arrived earlier, possibly up to 60,000 years ago. Unknown numbers of people moved southward along the western edge of the North American ice cap. The presence of the ice, which for a time virtually covered Canada, makes it reasonable to assume that the southern reaches of North America were settled before Canada, and that the Inuit (Eskimo) who live in Canada’s Arctic regions today were the last of the aboriginal peoples to reach Canada” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Before Europeans came, about 12 languages were developed by the natives of the land, and these languages were found in various cultures and tribes. Eventually, the Iroquois Confederacy was organized, which consisted of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca peoples, and eventually the Tuscarora.\n\nIn these tribes, and throughout the Iroquois Confederacy, there was mixture of agriculture and hunting. Also, some groups had a high-level of political, religious, cultural, and trading organization. According to Britannica.com, “The one characteristic virtually all the groups in precontact Canada shared was that they were self-governing and politically independent” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Though the eventual European explorers and invaders described the natives sometimes as savages, this was surmised out of ignorance.\n\nThe first European explorers of the Canadian region were Vikings from Iceland, where they came to Labrador and Newfoundland. There are still the remains of their settlements in these areas (Citizenship Canada). The natives and Vikings did not get along so well initially, although they eventually traded together, according to available evidence (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). After the Vikings eventually fled the region, John Cabot (aka Giovanni Caboti), an Italian navigator came upon this land. According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, “Cabot and his crew were the second group of Europeans to reach what would become Canada, following Norse explorers around 1000 CE. Despite not yielding the trade route Cabot hoped for, the 1497 voyage provided England with a claim to North America and knowledge of an enormous new fishery” (“John Cabot”). Though the Northwest Passage was not found, a new part of the British fishing industry emerged from this voyage. It also initiated trade between the natives and Europeans, though they were suspicious of each other.\n\nThe first claiming of land in Canada was by the French. As stated by Canada.ca, “Between 1534 and 1542, Jacques Cartier made three voyages across the Atlantic, claiming the land for King Francis I of France. Cartier heard two captured guides speak the Iroquoian word kanata, meaning “village.” By the 1550s, the name of Canada began appearing on maps” (Citizenship Canada). After these voyages, the first French settlement was constructed. According to Britannica, “… the French king, anxious to challenge the claims of Spain in the New World, decided to set up a fortified settlement. Internal and European politics delayed the enterprise until 1541, when, under the command of Jean-François de La Rocque, sieur (lord) de Roberval, Cartier returned to Stadacona and founded Charlesbourg-Royal just northwest of Quebec” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Though the French did not discover gems and other precious items in their new land, they still laid claim to the area that they “discovered.”\n\nMore French settlement activity continued in the name of competing with the Spanish. According to Britannica, “In 1604 the French navigator Samuel de Champlain, under Pierre du Gua, sieur de Monts, who had received a grant of the monopoly, led a group of settlers to Acadia. He chose as a site Dochet Island (Île Sainte-Croix) in the St. Croix River, on the present boundary between the United States and Canada. But the island proved unsuitable, and in 1605 the colony was moved across the Bay of Fundy to Port Royal (now Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia)” (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall). Though the settlement was made as a fur trading post, its water systems (rivers) were too difficult to get through for the efficient delivery of goods. This settlement eventually moved, and they also got involved in allied warfare with the natives. According to Discover Canada, “In 1608 Champlain built a fortress at what is now Québec City. Champlain allied the colony with the Algonquin, Montagnais, and Huron, historic enemies of the Iroquois, a confederation of five (later six) First Nations who battled with the French settlements for a century. The French and the Iroquois made peace in 1701” (Citizenship Canada). Unlike in the United States, the settlers were more respectful towards the natives, and even fought for the rights of certain tribes.\n\nIn the subsequent years, England, the Netherlands, and also Scotland tried to claim parts of Canada as their own through trade and warfare. The natives also got more intertwined in the business of fur trade, and even fought among tribes for control over trade. Competition for the region was in trade, land, and religion, with Catholics, Jesuits, and Protestants all wanting to claim their own in this new land. More elaborate governments and alliances were created to manage the region with greater effect. With many countries vying for Canada at its new home, the British eventually made it a new part of its empire, with the French taking a smaller portion in its governing and influence. Since 1848, responsible government was in place by the British, but Britain still had power over the region until 1931, with the Statute of Westminster. It stated that Canada had the same rank as the United Kingdom. With this confirmation, it took several more decades until Canada created its own Constitution, in 1982. However, with Canada now being a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, Queen Elizabeth II is still seen as the head of state (Nicholson, Norman L., and Roger D. Hall).\n\nMany details could not be elaborated on in this small space, but I hope the progression of this great country was made clear. Canada was first populated by culturally, spiritually, religiously, and linguistically sophisticated people, with 12 languages and many tribes. The Vikings were the first Europeans to venture to the land of Canada but did not stay for long. Italian John Cabot, hired by Britain, explored the region, and initiated a fishing industry there. The French came soon after, claiming land as their own in the area of Quebec. After New France was founded, British, Dutch, and other settlers for various countries fought for the trade, land, and even religion of this new place. Alliances with the natives were made for trade and religion, and wars started to be fought under the banner of trade, religion, and land ownage. However, after many grueling battles between the French and British, Canada eventually came under the sway of the British Empire, and stayed so until the Canadian Constitution was patriated in 1982. From then on, Canada shook off the shackles of dependency on Britain, and has remained mostly economically and governmentally stable since.###"}
{"prompt":"How can you get rid of hiccups?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Some people get annoyed over hiccuping over and over. There are even people who have chronic hiccuping. In fact, “how to get rid of hiccups” is one of the most-searched queries on the internet. Well, there are many things you can do. In order to get rid of hiccups, you can complete breathing and posture techniques, use pressure points to your advantage, eat and drink certain things, and use some special remedies. All of these solutions will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\n\nFirstly, there are many breathing and posturing techniques you can use to get rid of hiccups. Most of the techniques are easy to do. According to Healthline, there are six physical methods of vanquishing your next hiccup: practicing slow breathing, holding your breath in for a while, breathing into a paper bag, hugging your knees for two minutes while sitting down, compressing your chest by leaning or bending forward, and completing the Valsava maneuver. As stated by Healthline, “To do this maneuver, try to exhale while pinching your nose and keeping your mouth closed” (“How to Get Rid of Hiccups: 26 Remedies That Can Actually Help”). You cannot do all these techniques simultaneously, but you can try them one by one and see which ones work best for you.\n\nAlso, you can try to use your body’s pressure points to your advantage to dispel hiccups. Though pressure points seem like an esoteric science, standard western medicine recommends using them. According to Medical News Today, these three techniques that deal with these points can help: “[1] Pull on the tongue – hold the end of the tongue in the fingers and tug. [2] Press on the diaphragm gently. [3] Place gentle pressure on each side of the nose while swallowing” (Nordqvist, Christian). Though these methods might seem strange at first glance, they have a certain amount of effectiveness that warrants their recommendation.\n\nAnother natural way to get rid of hiccups is to consume certain foods and liquids. There are plenty of things we can eat and drink to chase away a nasty episode of hiccuping. As mentioned by Healthline, it is good to “drink ice water, slowly drink a glass of warm water without stopping to breathe, drink water through a cloth or paper towel, suck on an ice cube, gargle ice water, eat a spoonful of honey or peanut butter, eat some sugar, suck on a lemon, put a drop of vinegar on your tongue” (“How to Get Rid of Hiccups: 26 Remedies That Can Actually Help”) and more. Once again, test out which food and drink techniques work best, instead of trying many at the same time.\n\nAnd then, there are some strange techniques that have been recommended by scientists and other specialists. One of these theories states that hiccups can be relieved by having an orgasm (Peleg, R.). Another study mentioned that a rectal massage can aid in getting rid of hiccups (Odeh, M, et al). Other alternative methods include tapping or rubbing the back of one’s neck, poking the back of the throat with a Q-tip, and distracting yourself with something fascinating (“How to Get Rid of Hiccups: 26 Remedies That Can Actually Help”). The last one is even a time-honored tradition in certain countries.\n\nHiccups can be a nuisance, especially if they turn into a chronic condition. Thankfully, there are many actions we can take to clear up this issue: you can complete breathing and posture techniques, employ pressure points, eat and drink particular substances, and use some alternative remedies. It is best to find what works best for you out of the many choices discussed in this essay, as each body is different.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the history of April Fools' Day?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Possibly the funniest day of the year is April Fools’ Day. It happens on the first of April every year, and it comprises pranks and jokes on friends and family, and sometimes strangers. The phrase to use is “April Fools!” after you complete a prank or joke. But there is much more to this day than these common facts. There is a mysterious history of this celebration. There is no real consensus on when the holiday officially or unofficially began, but this essay will deal with all of the main theories.\n\nThe earliest possible mention of April Fools’ Day is in Geoffrey Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales, written in 1392. In the story “Nun’s Priest’s Tale” it is mentioned that “Syn March bigan thritty dayes and two.” This seems like a jokey way of saying the first of April. However, modern scholars believe there was a misprint, and that Chaucer meant another date—specifically the anniversary of the engagement of King Richard II of England to Anne of Bohemia on the 2nd of May (“The Origin of April Fool’s Day”).\n\nThe next piece of evidence about April Fools’ Day comes from the French poet Eloy d’Amerval. He wrote about “poisson d’avril” which means “fish of April” (Amerval, Eliy d.). Some scholars say that April Fools’ Day started in the Middle Ages in Europe, where the New Year was celebrated on April 1st. Those who had New Year’s Day on January 1st made fun of those who partook in the celebration on April 1st by sending people fishes. In fact, January 1st was made the mark of the new year officially only in 1564 according to the Edict of Roussillon (“The Origin of April Fool’s Day”).\n\nSpeaking of another mention of April Fool’s Day, in 1539, the Flemish poet Eduard de Dene wrote a poem about a nobleman who made his servants go on “foolish errands” (“The Origin of April Fool’s Day”). In a similar region, in the Netherlands, the beginning of this day was initiated with the Dutch victory at Brielle in 1572 over the Spanish. The fool, in this case, was the defeated Spanish Duke Álvarez de Toledo. Yet, scholars do not know how to explain this event becoming an international holiday (Brielle).\n\nThere are also two other theories that relate to more ancient times. According to History.com, “Historians have also linked April Fools’ Day to festivals such as Hilaria, which was celebrated in ancient Rome at the end of March and involved people dressing up in disguises. There’s also speculation that April Fools’ Day was tied to the vernal equinox, or the first day of spring in the Northern Hemisphere, when Mother Nature fooled people with changing, unpredictable weather” (“April Fools’ Day”). As you can see, more and more theories crop up the greater you investigate this holiday.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the origins of chess?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Chess is perhaps the most popular and treasured board game in the world. Millions of people play it daily, and millions of dollars of sponsorship go into the world championships of chess. It seems be getting even more popular as the years roll on. But how much do we know of its history, and where the royal game came from? This special game originated in India in the 6th century—but that is just the start of learning the beginnings of chess.\n\nThere are many legends surrounding the origin of chess, and also the rules of the game have transformed so much during its about 1500 years of history, that it is difficult to trace exactly when “chess” came into being as we know it. In each region, chess took on different rules, pieces, boards, and such. However, according to Chess.com, “Today we know that chess originated from the Gupta Empire (600CE), of India. The pieces come from the primary military elements of that time: the infantry, the elephants, the cavalry and the chariots” (“History of Chess: The Basics”). Some experts have claimed the game could have originated in China, but these assessments are in the minority. In India, the game was referred to as Chaturanga, and has been mentioned in Persian manuscripts.\n\nFrom India, chess traveled to Persia. As stated from Medium.com, “In 7th Century AD it was adopted as Satranj in Sassanid Persia. Several variations of chess evolved in Persia” (Naval, Saini). The queen and bishop had limited movement at this time, unlike the wide movement it has now. According to Ancientchess.com, “The form of chess which finally arrived in Europe was already being played in Persia some 1,350 years ago, when that area of the world was conquered by Muslim armies in the mid 7th century. The game became very popular in the Muslim world, and it was carried back, throughout Islam, across North Africa and eventually into Europe” (“Chess History”). So, the Muslim world was responsible for the greater migration of the game. Also, in Persia, the first recognizable chess pieces began to emerge that are similar to our modern ones. In addition, before chess became widespread in Europe, it was brought to Spain and Sicily through the Moors, who were Muslim inhabitants in those areas. This was around 800 AD. Another big event was that by 900 AD, Muslim chess players were writing books on the techniques of chess. This can be said to be the first writings on chess theory (Murray, H. J. R).\n\nThough our international chess game has many variants in many countries, the most popular one played today around the world started to become a pastime in Europe around 1000 AD. According to Ancientchess,com, “…the chess which came to Europe from Asia, passing from one culture to another, remained virtually unchanged for almost a millennium. Even as pieces changed shape and identity, the rules of the game remained remarkably stable. The first known printed occurrence of the new rules is dated 1497 — but that manuscript seems to indicate that the new game was already generally known” (“Chess History”). Chess spread like a wildfire throughout Europe after the rules had been changed so that the queen and bishop had greater mobility, and was even called “mad queen chess” and other variations on this title. With the newfound speed of chess, the game become more exciting and nuanced. This was the start of our modern chess, and it seems the popularity and growth of chess has not stopped since (Naval, Saini).\n\nChess is a game of about 1,500 years that originated in India, traveled to Persia, and through Muslim influence, spread throughout Europe. In that progression, its rules have drastically changed, and its pieces have also transformed. There are still several variations of chess in multiple countries, like China, Japan, Korea, and more.

{"prompt":"What is the significance of the discovery of Australopithecus sediba?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There has been discussion for decades about a missing link between early humans and their predecessors. It has been perhaps the most contentious issue in regards to human evolution in proving the theory of evolution as true and factual. Well, a missing link has been recently found. It does not give a complete picture of the progress from our predecessors to early humans, but it is a step in collecting more information to shape the entire canvas of our evolution. These transitional fossils are important to recover to chase away the questions of skeptics in the theory of evolution and to establish the complete trajectory of evolution. And despite new evidence being found, scientists remind the public that evolution is not linear. It is more complex than that: many branches of human evolution intersect, falling in and out of favor, so to speak. In this sense, there is not one fossil that will be the missing link, but many to show the true progression. Nonetheless, scientists have recently found that fossils of Australopithecus sediba, through extensive research, indicate these beings were closely linked to the Homo genus.\n\nBefore we discuss the recent discovery, it should be noted that several other “missing links” have been found previously. “Java Man” (Homo erectus) was discovered in 1891 in Indonesia; “Piltdown Man” was found in 1912, but was determined to be a hoax; “Taung Child” (Australopithecus africanus) was discovered in 1924 in South Africa; “Homo habilis” was found in 1964, though its classification is questioned; “Lucy” (Australopithecus afarensis) was discovered in 1974 in Ethiopia; and finally Australopithecus sediba was discovered starting from 2008, and more skeletons were found up until 2010 (Wood, Bernard, and Brian G. Richmond).\n\nThe discovery of the newest “missing link” happened upon by accident. According to CNN, “The Malapa site, South Africa’s “Cradle of Humankind,” was famously discovered by accident by nine-year-old Matthew Berger as he chased after his dog” (Picheta, Rob). The skeletons found of Australopithecus sediba assist in making sense of the gap between “Lucy” and “Homo habilis.” Australopithecus sediba was mostly an inhabitant of trees, most likely to be away from predators and to find food up there. They lived approximately two million years ago, and it took a decade of debate to determine the actual significance of the findings.\n\nThe new findings about these skeletons are important in showing why it is a missing link. According to CNN, “The hands have grasping capabilities, which are more advanced than those of Homo habilis, suggesting it, too, was an early tool-user” (Picheta, Rob). Also, one of the biggest discoveries coming from these skeletons is that they suggest that there were several lineages from our predecessors. The more research pours in, it seems more and more that human evolution was non-linear. This is also substantiated by the fact that several types of hominids interbred (Yancey-Bragg, N’dea). With more on this process, Professor Lee Berger from the University of the Witwatersrand states that, “human evolution is not a linear process, where one species evolves into another, but rather follows a process similar to a braided stream, or river delta, where a stream might branch off into its own direction, or later flow back and join a different stream, which might “evolve” into a new species” (“Australopithecus Sediba: No Such Thing as a Missing Link”).\n\nThus, the new “missing link” is just another piece in the puzzle of human evolution. There is no objective missing fossil or fossils that will solve a linear progression from our predecessors to early humans. Evolution is more complex than that. Despite several of these ancestors being found that can said to be filling in the gaps in our knowledge of human evolution, there are many more discoveries to come, and due to the complexity of evolution, it might take us many more years to get a full picture of our evolution, if that is possible.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the signs and symptoms, causes, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of measles?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Measles is in the news again for a recent outbreak. In the U.S. about 300 cases have been reported as of late. However, measles is an old virus. The first emergence of measles was around 500 AD. Therefore, it has been around since early history, and continues to affect people, despite vaccinations. The virus produces a highly contagious disease, and that is one of the reasons it has lasted so long in the lives of humans. This essay will describe the signs and symptoms, causes, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of this highly infectious virus.\n\nCommonly, children are infected with the virus. Though it is not usually fatal for adults, it can be for children. The signs and symptoms of measles last around 10-14 days subsequent to being exposed to the virus. The most common symptoms are: fever, dry cough, runny nose, sore throat, inflamed eyes, “tiny white spots with bluish-white centers on a red background found inside the mouth on the inner lining of the cheek — also called Koplik’s spots” (“Measles”), and a skin rash with flat blotches. The fever itself lasts for about four days to one week.\n\nIn terms of the causes of measles, it is simple. According to Children’s Hospital, “Measles is caused by morbillivirus, which is mostly seen in the winter and spring. It’s spread from one child to another through direct contact with discharge from the nose and throat. Sometimes, it is spread through airborne droplets (from a cough or sneeze) from an infected child” (“Measles (Rubeola) Symptoms & Causes | Boston Children’s Hospital”). The measles virus is a single-stranded, negative-sense, enveloped RNA virus. It can live up to two hours in airspace or surfaces (“Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases”).\n\nThe good thing about measles is that it can be diagnosed rather easily. It has characteristic features that distinguish it from other diseases caused by viruses. Stated by Mayo Clinic, “Your doctor can usually diagnose measles based on the disease’s characteristic rash as well as a small, bluish-white spot on a bright red background — Koplik’s spot — on the inside lining of the cheek. However, many doctors have never seen measles, and the rash can be confused with a number of other illnesses. If necessary, a blood test can confirm whether the rash is truly measles” (Measles”). However, as told above, measles is more rare than other diseases, so it is important to take the appropriate tests to determine the validity of your doctor’s claims.\n\nThe bad news is that receiving the measles virus is hard to avoid due to its highly infectious and contagious nature. There is not much in the way of recommendations. According to Children’s Hospital, “Since the use of the Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine, the number of children infected with measles has dropped by 99 percent. About 5 percent of measles are due to vaccine failure. The vaccine is usually given when your child is 12 to 15 months old, and then again when he is between 4 and 6 years old” (“Measles (Rubeola) Symptoms & Causes | Boston Children’s Hospital”). So, getting vaccinated is our best bet at fighting off the virus and becoming immune to it.\n\nIf you happen to get infected with measles, there are various ways to treat it. However, there is no medicine that directly treats measles. With that said, these are the various treatments: “acetaminophen to relieve fever and muscle aches, rest to help boost your immune system, plenty of fluids (six to eight glasses of water a day), humidifier to ease a cough and sore throat, [and] vitamin A supplements” (“Measles: Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatments”). It is best to combine all these treatments for the best effect.\n\nMeasles is an ancient virus that has adapted and mutated throughout history. Currently, it is making a comeback. However, getting vaccinated is the surest way of avoiding getting infected by this contagious virus. As soon as you notice any signs or symptoms of measles—fever, dry cough, runny nose, sore throat, inflamed eyes, Koplik’s spots, and a skin rash with flat blotches—then head to your doctor for a diagnosis and recommendations for treatment.###"}
{"prompt":"How did LeBron James become one of the most popular basketball players in the world?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Lebron James (LeBron Raymone James Sr.) is one of the most popular basketball players now, and sometimes considered the best basketball player in the world. He won the National Basketball Association (NBA) Most Valuable Player Award four times, three NBA Finals MVP Player awards, and two Olympic gold medals. James has also been in 15 NBA All-Star Games and was the MVP All-Star MVP three times. This is just a short list of his accomplishments, as he has dominated the sport since his teen years. Even though people know him as a phenomenal basketball player, this essay will divulge information about his private life and what journey he went on to become a professional basketball player.\n\nHe was born in 1984, December 30, in Akron, Ohio. His mother, Gloria Marie James, was 16 years old at the time of his birth, while his father, Anthony McClelland, has a criminal record and was not present in his early life and now. As a single mother, Gloria, moved from apartment to apartment, ending up in Akron. She struggled to find a stable job. Eventually, worried about LeBron’s upbringing, she brought him to live with a local football coach named Frank Walker. LeBron was nine years old at the time, and the Walker introduced basketball to him (Sharp, Anne Wallace).\n\nBy the time he was in the fifth grade, LeBron was playing in an organized basketball team. Namely, he played for the Northwest Ohio Shooting Stars for the Amatuer Athletic Union. He made strong bonds with teammates Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee. They had a lot of success at the local and national level while being on the team, and they decided they would all go to the same high school to remain as a team. Controversially, the four students chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, which primarily was a white school, whereas LeBron and his friends were black (Nichols, Rachel).\n\nIt was obvious that LeBron was a natural, as even as a freshman, he dominated the high school circuit. In his first year, he averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game. The St. Vincent–St. Mary High School’s team, The Fighting Irish, went undefeated in the season, 27–0. This made a new record for the first high school boys basketball team in Ohio to go undefeated in a season. After this first year, Lebron was a sensation, and went into his sophomore a star. He did not disappoint the fans, with 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds with 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game. For some games, bigger venues had to be booked to accommodate the amount of people who wanted to watch the games of the team. NBA scouts were already taking a keen notice of LeBron. That year, the team went 26–1, and LeBron was named “Ohio Mr. Basketball” and was chosen for the USA Today All-USA First Team. He was the first high school sophomore to do so (NBA.com: Prospect Profile: LeBron James).\n\nBefore entering his junior year of high school, LeBron was getting a lot of press. He was featured in the American basketball magazine Slam on the cover, and was called, “the best high school basketball player in America right now” (“Ohio Player”). LeBron also became the first high school basketball underclassmen to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated. His junior year was spectacular as well, with an average of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game. Again, he was crowned “Ohio Mr. Basketball” and selected for the USA Today All-USA First Team. In addition, he became the first junior ever to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year. However, his team did not do as well as in the previous two years, with a record of 23–4 (Sharp, Anne Wallace). This was a difficult time for him, as he was getting a lot of media attention and he did not know how to deal with it properly. He started to use marjuana as an anti-stress tool. To add to the anxiety, he wanted to enter the NBA draft early, but the NBA would not sway the rules for him, and he had to compete in his senior year in order to enter the NBA. Just a side note: LeBron also played football through his freshman to junior year, and also produced a good record (“LeBron’s Book Shows Struggle With Fame”).\n\nHis averages continued to make gains, with his senior year closing out at 1.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game. LeBron and the Fighting Irish played against many national teams, and some games were even televised as pay-per-view games due to LeBron’s fame. For a new record, Lebron was named “Ohio Mr. Basketball” and selected for the USA Today All-USA First Team for the third year in a row. Again, he was named Gatorade National Player of the Year. He participated in many end-of-the-year competitions for high school and officially entered the NBA draft. There were some issues during his senior year, though, with run-ins with the law. His mother gave him a gift of a Hummer through a loan based on his viability as a future NBA player. This was against the rules of the Ohio High School Athletic Association, but he was eventually cleared of all wrongdoing. Furthermore, he accepted gifts from fans who wanted him to pose for pictures with them. He was suspended for two games for this, but made an amazing comeback in the game after the suspension, scoring a high school career-high of 52 points (Bolch, Ben).\n\nIn the 2003 NBA Draft, he was the first overall pick. His hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, chose him. And the decision seemed to be a solid one: in his first NBA game, he scored 25 points against the Sacramento Kings, which set a record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player (“Expectations for James More than Met”). The rest, you can say, is history.\n\nLeBron James might be the best basketball player of all time, if not the most talented. Coming from a mother without much of a home to give, he found wings in the home of a football coach. He played football and basketball throughout his school days, but excelled most in basketball. By the end of his freshman year in high school, he was already a local and even national star. And by the time he was a sophomore, it was clear he was going to be in the NBA. Through some legal issues, problems at home, and media attention, LeBron found the strength and focus to play to the best of his ability and became an international sensation in sports history.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the earliest recorded military conflict in history?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" For almost as long as civilizations have been around, warfare has been present. It is not so easy to trace the exact beginnings of war, but we have recorded history that tells us the facts, and also artifacts that hint at what kind of military action took place. From archeological digs, specialists can discern that the first military campaign was executed around 9000 BC in ancient Jericho. The following paragraphs will explain what took place in this region and the subsequent history of military conflict.\n\nJericho is considered the first true city by many historians. Around 9000 BC, near the present-day West Bank, the Natufians settled. According to MilataryHistoryNow, “Made up of roughly 70 igloo-shaped mud brick dwellings that together housed up to 1,000 people, the city itself was surrounded by a 15-foot high stone wall nearly four feet thick at its base. While some speculate that this barrier might have been erected to keep the community safe from raiders, others believe it was used to protect the town from floodwaters. Despite the purpose of these fortifications, Jericho was ultimately abandoned following what archeologists believe was an invasion of some sort, presumably by an army of nomads or perhaps warriors from another city somewhere beyond the horizon” (“First Blood – History’s Earliest Recorded Military Conflicts”). However, there is no direct evidence of a battle or confrontation. There are hints of an invasion, but the exact kind of conflict was not identified. As a side note, bows and arrows were in use starting around 10,000 BC, and the cemeteries of Mesopotamia and Egypt display the effects of this weapon being employed (Mark, Joshua J.).\n\nThe oldest direct evidence of warfare starts with Hamoukar. Located in present-day Syria, the earliest settlement in the area dates back to about 5,000 BC. As stated by The New York Times, “The archaeologists reported finding collapsed mud-brick walls that had undergone heavy bombardment and ensuing fire. All around, they collected more than 1,200 oval-shaped “bullets” used with slings and some 120 larger round clay balls” (Wilford, John Noble). Therefore, more than just assumptions can be made about the site at Hamoukar, as compared to Jericho.\n\nA big turning point, however, took place with the invention of writing. Civilizations began to record their wars. The first recorded war happened in Mesopotamia around 2700 BC between Sumer and Elam. According to the Ancient History Encyclopedia, “The Sumerians, under command of the King of Kish, Enembaragesi, defeated the Elamites in this war and, it is recorded, “carried away as spoils the weapons of Elam.” At approximately the same time as this campaign, King Gilgamesh of Uruk marched on his neighbors in order to procure cedar for construction of a temple. While it has been argued that Gilgamesh is a mythological character, the archaeological evidence of a historical King Enembaragesi, who is mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh, lends weight to the claim that the latter was also a real historical figure” (Mark, Joshua J.). These accounts were carved on stone tablets by scribes. In later wars in the same region, giant pictographs were created to display the records of bloodshed. As MilitaryHistoryNow statesm, “A more detailed account of another war, this time between competing Sumerian factions from the cities Lagash and Umma, circa 2525 BCE, was immortalized pictorially in a stone tablet. It supposedly shows the slain enemies of the Lagash ruler Eannatum being torn to pieces by vultures and lions. The carving, known as the Stele of Vultures, stands as the first recorded likenesses of ancient soldiers – helmeted and armoured spearmen arranged in tight formations being led by a figure in a chariot” (“First Blood – History’s Earliest Recorded Military Conflicts”). This is also the first visual evidence of the invention of the chariot, which became a key instrument in warfare in the ancient world.\n\nAs it can be seen, organized battles and wars have been waged perhaps since 10,000 BC, with the introduction of the bow. The indirect evidence starts around 9,000 BC in Jericho, where historians believed an invasion happened and that the inhabitants there put up a fight. Substantial direct evidence was found that dated back to about 5000 BC, where the site of Hamoukar was bombarded by bullet-like weapons. Finally, the written record of wars was initiated around 2,700 BC by scribes, describing the war between Sumer and Elam on stone tablets. Wars have been happening almost since the dawn of civilization, and it seems they will continue to be waged for millenia to come.###"}
{"prompt":"What was the story of Myspace?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Myspace was one of the most popular websites in the world in its golden age. It still operates, but has now been overshadowed by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media platforms. It was the largest social networking site from 2005 to 2009, which is a good stretch for the current social media climate. It is an interactive platform, providing users with the ability to blog, find music, search for groups, post\/locate photos, watch videos, and more. Let us venture into the history of this remarkable social media platform, which led the internet into the realm of a social media craze.\n\nThe story of Myspace begins with employees of the now defunct company eUniverse, which was an internet marketing company. In 2003, a few of the employees had accounts on the site Friendster (a defunct social gaming site), and thought that some elements of it had great potential. Specifically, the employees tried to capitalize on the most popular parts of Friendster. In only 10 days, this group of individual created the first version of Myspace using the rapid web development application named ColdFusion. In that short span of time, finances, human resources, technical expertise, bandwidth, and server capacity was already fully prepared. The starting employees of Myspace were Brad Greenspan (eUniverse’s Founder, Chairman, CEO), Chris DeWolfe (Myspace’s starting CEO), Josh Berman, Tom Anderson (MySpace’s starting president), and programmers and other staff from eUniverse (CBS News).\n\nIt is not surprising that the first users of MySpace were the employees of eUniverse. In fact, eUniverse made the gathering of new users competitive by making a competition to see who get the most fresh people to join the website. Through the joining of company employees and by sending out countless emails to subscribers of eUniverse, Myspace gained significant ground fast. The numbers of members grew so fast, that soon it was competing with the top social media sites in the world. This process was also aided by the able hands of Toan Nguyen, who helped stabilize the platform. In addition, Co-founder and CTO Aber Whitcomb did great work in software architecture at a speedy rate. This rate of development outmatched other social media sites, despite them having larger teams of developers (“MySpace Marketing”).\n\nMyspace grew in membership at an alarming rate due to it being free and having a variety of popular functions. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, “It quickly distinguished itself from established social networking sites by allowing—and in fact encouraging—musical artists to use the site to promote themselves, earning Myspace a hip cachet and making it a favoured destination site for youth. It also developed a reputation for racier profiles and a raunchier attitude than other sites” (“Myspace”). With it being famous among young adults and teenagers, the site became a hub of the newest generation. In fact, Myspace was so powerful that by February of 2005, talks were held with Mark Zuckerberg about purchasing Facebook, though the offer of $75 million was denied (Arrington, Michael).\n\nSome big shake ups started to happen in the social media world. In July of 2005, the Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation bought Myspace for $580 million. The purchase was worth it, as within one year, the value of Myspace tripled. The strategy though was to use Myspace as a venue to direct traffic to their other sites. Anyway, with this big purchase, Myspace entered the international market, with versions of the site available in the UK, the Netherlands, China, and other nations. By 2007, Myspace was deemed the most popular social media platform in the world, over Facebook, LinkedIn, and other major sites. That was its peak of traffic, and slowly Facebook gained ground over Myspace by updating each features regularly and making it a more universal tool than Myspace.\n\nTo summarize, a pioneer in social media, Myspace was born out of another company, eUniverse. Its employees in early 2003 began to develop the website rapidly and had competitions to make it grow. Soon enough, with its focus on entertainment and social bonding through interests, it grew to be the world’s number one social media platform by 2007. However, Facebook took over this position over time through its adaptable nature and ever-changing functions.###"}
{"prompt":"How did Saint Patrick's Day come to be?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" St. Patrick’s Day, even for the Irish, is often shrouded in mystery, or people rarely consider it necessary to look up the significance of this holiday. Mostly, it is seen as a day to wear green and get drunk at the pub with friends. But is there a deeper meaning behind this Irish celebration? In order to uncover the details, the life of Saint Patrick will be discussed, as well how the holiday came into being and how it is celebrated.\n\nSaint Patrick is seen as the foremost patron saint of Ireland. Saint Patrick is, “credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland and probably responsible in part for the Christianization of the Picts and Anglo-Saxons. He is known only from two short works, the Confessio, a spiritual autobiography, and his Letter to Coroticus, a denunciation of British mistreatment of Irish Christians. Since his writings have come to be better understood, it is increasingly recognized that, despite their occasional incoherence, they mirror a truth and a simplicity of the rarest quality” (O’Raifeartaigh, Tarlach). So, despite the many legends about him, he was a real person that contributed to bringing Christianity to the masses in Ireland and for his easy-to-read pieces of writing.\n\nIn regard to the legends, there are quite a few. It is not surprising since he was such a pivotal figure in Irish history. The main legend pertains to him driving snakes to the sea. Other legends are, “…that he raised people from the dead, and a 12th-century hagiography places this number at 33 men, some of whom are said to have been deceased for many years. He also reportedly prayed for the provision of food for hungry sailors traveling by land through a desolate area, and a herd of swine miraculously appeared. Another legend, probably the most popular, is that of the shamrock, which has him explain the concept of the Holy Trinity, three persons in one God, to an unbeliever by showing him the three-leaved plant with one stalk” (O’Raifeartaigh, Tarlach). The historicity of these claims cannot be verified, but they add to the magic of St. Patrick’s Day.\n\nSt. Patrick’s Day marks the saint’s death day, March 17th, 461 AD. In early 17th century, this day was made into a feast day that is now celebrated in the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Lutheran Church. According to Ireland.com, “Raise your glasses to Luke Wadding, an Irish Franciscan friar from Waterford whose persistent efforts turned March 17 into a feast day” (“9 St Patrick’s Day Facts”). So, Luke Wadding is the main propagator of the feast and ultimately the holiday. Officially, the celebration commemorates the bringing of Christianity into Ireland and Irish culture in general. Though religious Irish people might attend church services on this day, it is also a lenient day where the ban on drinking alcohol is often lifted. That is why the holiday is commonly associated with drinking beer (Moore, Willard B.).\n\nThough Ireland certainly makes a big deal out of St. Patrick’s Day, it is often the Irish diaspora in North America and other areas that perhaps put on the biggest show. Parades, parties, mischief, and Irish pride is on display on March 17th in most cities of large Irish populations outside of Ireland. In terms of parades, “the first St Patrick’s Day parade was not held in Ireland at all, but in Boston in the United States in 1737. This was followed by an “official” parade in New York in 1766. Ireland was a little further behind – our first parade was held in Waterford in 1903, while Dublin joined the club back in 1931” (“9 St Patrick’s Day Facts”). Another interesting fact is that the wearing of green on this holiday only started in the 19th century, and before that time, mostly people wore blue for the celebration (“9 St Patrick’s Day Facts”).\n\nSt. Patrick’s Day is a joyous celebration of Irish heritage, culture, and more historically, the bringing of Christianity to Ireland. The tradition of going to the pub, wearing green, and putting on parades came much later in its history, as it first started as a religious feast in the 17th century, despite St. Patrick dying in 461 AD.###"}
{"prompt":"What was the original purpose of Yahoo, and how did it become one of the most popular websites in the world?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Though Yahoo (or properly written as Yahoo!) might not be as popular as it was in its formative days, its sites are still the 8th most popular on the internet. This internet pioneer is still known for its email, news page, and other services. With Yahoo being created in the early 1990s, it pushed the internet into new directions and offered users innovative services. In the following paragraphs, an exploration will be done in-depth about this pioneer company in terms of its history and development.\n\nJerry Yang and David Filo, both electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, created a website called “Jerry and David’s guide to the World Wide Web” in January of 1994. The website featured a directory of other websites that were searchable (Clark, Andrew). They added onto this directory with fervor, despite having to work on their graduate projects as well. The domain yahoo.com was officially created on January 18th of that year (“Computer History for 1995”).\n\nHowever, by March 1994, the website was renamed “Yahoo!”. The Yahoo Directory was only edited by the creators at the time and was not edited autonomously through algorithms. This was the original purpose of Yahoo though: for humans to cater to humans traveling through the early days of the internet (Thomson, David G.). The term Yahoo is used not by accident. It is a backronym (an acronym made from a phrase whose initial letters spell out a word or words, to create a memorable name or as a fun explanation of a word’s origin) for “Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle” or “Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle” (“The History of Yahoo! – How It All Started…”). According to Lifewire, “Jerry and David said they liked the definition of a yahoo: “rude, unsophisticated, uncouth. “In the end, the word Yahoo! did roughly describe it as a web search directory”’ (Gil, Paul). Overall, you can tell the creators of Yahoo were having a good time with forming this innovative website.\n\nDespite it being a pet project of two graduate students, Yahoo took off. According to Yahoo! Media Relations, “Jerry and David soon found they were not alone in wanting a single place to find useful Web sites. Before long, hundreds of people were accessing their guide from well beyond the Stanford trailer. Word spread from friends to what quickly became a significant, loyal audience throughout the closely-knit Internet community” (“The History of Yahoo! – How It All Started…”). In fact, in the fall of 1994, they had already accumulated one million hits and about 100 thousand unique visitors.\n\nAfter seeing these numbers, Jerry and David approached venture capitalists and incorporated the business. As Yahoo! Media Relations states, “They eventually came across Sequoia Capital, the well-regarded firm whose most successful investments included Apple Computer, Atari, Oracle and Cisco Systems. They agreed to fund Yahoo! in April 1995 with an initial investment of nearly $2 million” (“The History of Yahoo! – How It All Started…”). And after getting funded, they sought out a management team. They hired two veterans of the market: Tim Koogle and Jeffrey Mallet.\n\nAfter receiving the second round of funding in the fall of 1995, Yahoo launched an IPO (initial public offering) in April of 1996. At the time, they had 49 employees. Fast forward to the early 2000s, and Yahoo was the number one Internet brand globally. However, after the late 2000s, it gradually declined in influence. Google gained ground with a cheaper workforce and better models for search engines and directories (“The History of Yahoo! – How It All Started…”).\n\nYahoo was the first company of its kind: a popular directory leading users to the best sites on the internet. It grew to be a worldwide phenomenon in mail, news, searches, images, and more. However, after wrestling over the market with Google for close to a decade, Google ultimately overcame its power, and now Yahoo remains a respectable 8th place in most-used websites.###"}
{"prompt":"How did YouTube become one of the most popular websites on the internet?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" YouTube was and still is still a mass craze. It is a video-sharing website that features home-made videos from creators, and also professionally made content from companies, experts, forums, and many other participants. You can like and comment on videos, add videos to your favorites, make playlists, subscribe to channels, report bad content, and do many other actions to videos you watch. It is a highly interactive and lucrative platform for many users. YouTube crosses generations, as everyone from small children to senior citizens enjoy utilizing the application’s features. However, how much do we know about its beginnings and development? This essay will discuss the foundations of this popular platform, and how it grew into one of the leading websites on the internet.\n\nThree employees of PayPal—Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim—started coming up with ideas for a site that would allow users to easily access videos in early 2005. They had several concepts floating around in their talks, such as, “a dating website called “Tune In, Hook Up”, which allowed users to post videos of themselves for others to view and decide whether or not to “hook up” with them. Sadly, no one was willing to make use of the service and the concept failed. Fortunately, the platform’s video uploading and posting technology was sound, and when the group had a discussion about how hard it was to find a video online of Janet Jackson’s infamous “wardrobe malfunction”, during the 2004 Superbowl Halftime show, a concept began to form in their collective hormone-soaked brains” (“The History of YouTube”). The idea of a public video-sharing website sprung from this incident—which would be the first of its kind on the internet.\n\nThe domain www.youtube.com was activated on February 14th of 2005. After developing the site over the next few months, the team approached investors to fund their project. Sequoia Capital made an $11.5 million investment and Artis Capital management gave $8 as an investment as well. Their first headquarters was above a pizzeria and Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California (“Ready for Its Close-Up”).\n\nIn April of 2005, the first YouTube video was posted. According to Phrasee, “It was an 18 second clip of YouTube founder Jawed Karim standing in front of elephants at the zoo; it was appropriately entitled “Me at the zoo”’ (“The History of YouTube”). This video can still be viewed on the site. From this first video and more testing, the beta version of the website was released to the public in May of 2005. Since its release, several major companies took interest in the platform’s advertising potential. Nike was one of the first to see its capabilities. According to Business Insider, “In September 2005, YouTube got its first one million-hit video. The video was a Nike ad that went viral. It was a clip of Brazilian soccer player Ronaldinho receiving his pair of Golden Boots” (Dickey, Megan Rose). This advertisement and several more hit videos caught the attention of the public and companies alike.\n\nWith this success, YouTube officially launched out of beta in December of 2005. At the time of the official launch, the website was already receiving eight million views a day. But this is a small number in terms of growth. YouTube grew at a rapid rate, that by June of 2006, it stated that 65,000 new videos were being made a day, and that they were receiving over 100 million views daily. With more and more rapid growth, on October 9th of 2006, Google announced that it had acquired YouTube for 1.65 billion in Google stock. Just a little over a year of YouTube becoming an activated domain, it had become so popular and famous that the technology giant Google saw its great potential and decided the time was ripe to acquire it. In Google’s hands, YouTube introduced advertisements, live recording, payment for creators, and much more.\n\nThe beginnings of YouTube started from an idea from three employees of PayPal of sharing videos across the internet without a problem. Before YouTube, individual videos were posted on websites, but having a single website dedicated to archiving and collecting videos for the public to see at their own volition was a fresh idea. Their concept was such a hit that in only six months of its existence, big companies were posting advertisements there and millions of views a day were being counted. And, only a little after one year, Google set its sights on acquiring the website to develop it even further. Now, it is the second-most popular website on the internet.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the history of the World Cup?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Also called the FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) World Cup, this event is one of the most riveting and most-watched in the world. The World Cup displays the best of men’s national football teams around the globe traditionally (women had their first world cup starting from 1991), with one champion standing at the end of the competition. With football being perhaps the most popular sport worldwide, the World Cup is the climax of excitement for countless fans. However, most fans do not know much of this competition’s history and background. Therefore, this essay will delve into the depths of the World Cup’s past.\n\nInternational football matches were being held long before the World Cup originated. The first international football match was a challenge between Scotland and England in 1872 in Glasgow. It was a tough match that ended in a draw with 0-0. At this time, football was not that popular internationally, and was not recognized as an Olympic sport. The match was reported on in Bell’s Life in London and Sporting Chronicle on Sunday 1, 1872: “A splendid display of football in the really scientific sense of the word, and a most determined effort on the part of the representatives of the two nationalities to overcome each other. The only thing which saved the Scotch team from defeat, considering the powerful forward play of England, was the magnificent defensive play and tactics shown by their backs, which was also taken advantage of by the forwards” (England Football Online). It was seen as a friendly match and an exhibition of international tournaments to come.\n\nThough England versus Scotland was the first international match, the initial international football tournament happened in 1884, at the first British Home Championship. It featured national teams from Scotland, England, Northern Ireland, and Wales. According to the National Football Museum, “The first game took place on 26 January 1884 between Ireland and Scotland in Belfast, ending in a 5-0 win for the visitors. Unusually, Ireland were involved in all of the first three matches, these games all taking place within a four week period. This may have accounted for their heavy losses, but the deciding match proved to be Scotland’s 1-0 win against England at Glasgow’s Cathkin Park in March” (“The British Home Championship”). For most of the late 1800s, Scotland was the top team in the world. This is in contrast to the national team of present Scotland, that rarely does well in the World Cup.\n\nFrom this first international tournament, football grew in popularity in the 20th century. It became more widespread in areas outside of the United Kingdom. By the year 1900, football was included as a sport in the Olympics, though it was labelled as a demonstration sport with no medals given (however, medals were retroactively given). Great Britain won first place, France won second place, and third place was given to Belgium. Football was also included in the 1904 Summer Olympics. In the 1906 Intercalated Games, another international tournament was played. According to the report, “Four teams entered the football tournament, one from Denmark and three from Greek cities, of which two (Smyrna and Thessaloniki) were then part of the Ottoman Empire. While the Athens and Thessaloniki teams consisted of Greek nationals (the Thessaloniki team featured one English national), the Smyrna side was composed of sons of foreign (English, French and Armenian) merchants in the city (nowadays called İzmir)” (“Intermediate Games of the IV. Olympiad”). This competition seemed to be more bent on political participation than on the actual strength of the teams.\n\nFIFA was founded in 1904, and through its organization, it did its best to organize an international tournament outside of the Olympics in 1906 in Switzerland. However, the tournament can be described as a failure. According to FIFA.com, “Various national associations had major worries, with the French governing body divided internally. These difficulties were a heavy burden for the FIFA President who had set about his tasks with so much enthusiasm. Guerin increasingly withdrew from the sport and handed over the administration to Vice-President Schneider and Espir, his personal assistant” (FIFA.com). Despite the fragmentation of governing bodies, the first World Cup (though not officially recognized currently), featured 12 teams, with Uruguay being the surprise champion over second-place Austria, third-place Argentina, and fourth-place England (“1906 FIFA World Cup (AEWCF)”). From this messy first World Cup came many more Olympic football matches and a clear organization for the World Cup in the 1930s.\n\nThough many more details could be added, it can be seen that the rapid growth of football as an international sport gave way to the World Cup and it being included as an Olympic sport. The oldest football clubs were organized in England, and from there it spread through Great Britain. After several international tournaments featuring Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and England, it became an Olympic sport. Subsequent to the sport being an Olympic sport, FIFA was put together, and although the first World Cup of 1906 was deemed a failure in terms of its organization, it marked the beginning of the most-watched sports event in history.###"}
{"prompt":"How did Selena Gomez become one of the most famous entertainers in the world?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Selena Gomez is one of the most famous entertainers in the world. She is an American singer, actress, and even producer. Besides being the most followed Instagram user, she has won more important accolades, such as having seven top-ten songs in the US Billboard Hot 100, an ALMA Award, eighteen Teen Choice Awards, an American Music Award, an MTV Video Music Award, a People’s Choice Award, and two Billboard Women in Music Awards. But how much do we actually know about Gomez, despite her being an uber-famous actress and a singer of catchy tunes? This essay will delve into her history and show her progression to becoming an acclaimed performer.\n\nSelena Marie Gomez was born on July 22, 1992, in Grand Prairie, Texas. Her parents are Ricardo Joel Gomez and stage actress Amanda Dawn “Mandy” Cornett. Since her mother was an entertainer, it is no surprise that Selena after the singer Selena Quintanilla-Pérez. However, the marriage between her parents was not happy, and the couple divorced when Selena was only five years old. Selena stayed with her mother after the separation. The family struggled financially since Selena’s birth, and even more so after the divorce. Also, her mother was sixteen years old was she gave birth to Selena, and Selena’s grandparents helped to raise her (Bahr, Anna).\n\nDespite this rough upbringing, she got an early start in the entertainment industry, being inspired by watching her mother preparing for stage productions. Before she was 10 years old, she was already auditioning. Barney & Friends, a famous children’s television show, chose Selena to appear in the production in 2002. In all, Selena appeared in 13 episodes in two years before she was deemed too old to be present on the show. Selena later stated that she learned most of what she knows now about acting for television from this initial experience (“Selena Gomez”).\n\nWhile working on Barney & Friends, she had a cameo role in the film Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over in 2003. Her next cameo appearance was on the film Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire in 2005. Continuing to audition through her schooling, she also made a guest appearance on an episode of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody in 2006. She was homeschooled throughout these years, all the way up until receiving her high school diploma in 2010 (Nessif, Bruna).\n\nHer breakout year, though, was 2007. This was in large part due to her being accepted for a recurring role in the series Hannah Montana, where she acted as popstar character Mikayla. While working on this series, Selena filmed pilot episodes for Disney shows Arwin! and Stevie Sanchez. She also auditioned and got the lead role in the Disney series Wizards of Waverly Place. This caused a dramatic shift in her career and family life, as Selena and her mother moved to Hollywood, California. Wizards of Waverly Place became a mainstream hit, and even went on to win nominations and awards. During this time, her singing career also started to take off, as she sang the theme song for Wizards of Waverly Place (“Wizards Of Waverly Place”).\n\nWhile working on this series in its second season, she made more cameo appearances in music videos, and contributed to the album DisneyMania 6 with the cover of the song “Cruella de Vil.” In addition, she recorded the song “Fly to Your Heart” for the soundtrack for the film “Tinker Bell.” She also had a leading role in the film Another Cinderella Story in 2008. She was asked to sing three songs for the soundtrack. In the same year, Selena had a supporting role in the film Horton Hears a Who, which went onto to be a great success. All this work in her portfolio impressed the Hollywood Records label, and they agreed to sign her at age 16. This was just the beginning of her rapid stardom: she recorded several albums with a band, and went on to have a successful solo career, and continued to be in hit films, with roles that show her growing maturity as an artist. Though she later contracted lupus disease, she has a strong will, and continues to tour and act in films, receiving accolades and praise from critics (Rocketto, Leah).\n\nDespite her financial issues in her childhood, and contracting lupus disease, Selena Gomez has been an entertainer practically since age 10. Inspired by her mother, she has been cast in many films, televisions series, and commercials, along with obtaining a budding music career as a popstar. From her portfolio, you can see without doubt that she is a hard worker and always keeps herself busy. Despite her health issues, her future looks bright.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the history of Craigslist?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Craigslist is a long-standing website that acts as an online classified advertising place that has a wide range of applications. For instance, Craigslist has listings for jobs, housing, meetups, gigs, resumes, services, and more. Though it was created early on in the history of the internet, it still remains a thriving place, and this is indicated that in 2018, “Craigslist” was one of the most searched-for queries on the internet. Currently, it has around 20 billion page views per month. Most people use this famous website without thinking twice about its history and origins. Therefore, this essay will address this lack of information by providing an overview of Craigslist’s story.\n\nThe arc of this journey began with Craig Newmark: a programmer. Newmark had seen a few websites doing positive actions on the internet in the early days of the web. This inspired him to make an email distribution list for friends in San Francisco that dealt with local events. He wanted to connect his friends and other people through events in San Francisco. The initial mailing list was launched at the beginning of 1995. Most of the postings at its outset were made by Newmark, detailing events for programmers and software developers (“Factsheet”).\n\nThis free non-profit mailing list began to blossom from word of mouth. In fact, the growth of the list grew rapidly in terms of both subscribers and postings. At this point, there was no moderation of the list, and soon users began to post other things than just event-related topics. Some individuals started to use Craigslist as a way to find employees and jobs. With this interest, users demanded that a “jobs” category be added, which was done. This made the mailing community grow at an even faster rate, and demand for more categories came again and again. This growth made the mailing list encounter some hiccups, but it resolved its glitches and limitations in June of 1995 (Boulton, Terynn).\n\nBy 1996, users wanted a web interface to effectively venture through postings. Thus, in that year, “craigslist.org” was registered and went live. According to Gizmodo, “Fast forward to 1998, Newmark was still enjoying a career as a software engineer, more specifically a hardcore java programmer. Craigslist was still a hobby to him, but a hobby with great perks. Through the site, he was getting himself invited to the best parties for geeks and nerds out there” (Boulton, Terynn). But with the rapid growth of Craigslist, Newmark’s attention became more and more focused on his beloved site.\n\nThis resulted in Newmark incorporating Craigslist as a private for-profit company in 1999. The website was growing so quickly that Newmark decided to leave his job as a software engineer. He now spent his full attention on Craigslist, though he wanted to not make the maximum amount of profit from the site, but rather run it on a “minimal profit” model in order to not scare away users and to keep the culture of the website intact (Boulton, Terynn).\n\nNot surprisingly, the year 2000 was big for the website. By April of that year, Craigslist had nine employees that worked from Newmark’s apartment in San Francisco (“Archived page from Craigslist’s About Us”). Also, Jim Buckmaster joined the company as the lead programmer and CTO. According to an archived page on Craigslist, he, “Formerly served as lead programmer and CTO, contributing craigslist’s multi-city architecture, first search engine, discussion forums, flagging system, self-posting process, homepage design, personals, and best-of-craigslist” (“Jim Buckmaster—CEO & programmer”). At the end of 2000, Buckmaster was promoted to the position of CEO. Though Newmark continues to be a vital member of Craigslist to this day as a spokesmen, representative, and chairman, he has taken a more-or-less passive position compared to the early days of the website.\n\nThe legendary website Craigslist began as a mailing project in the seminal years of the internet to connect people to local events in San Francisco. Users soon demanded more from the mailing list, with added categories and a website to view all the content easily and efficiently. The growth of Craigslist was mostly due to word-of-mouth promotion, and it became a worldwide cultural phenomenon. Beginning as a non-profit, it is now a for-profit company that strives for minimal profit to allow users to enjoy the website without the hindrance of subscriptions and the like.###"}
{"prompt":"How did the Silk Road contribute to globalization?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The Silk Road (114 BCE – 1450s CE) was an ancient system of trade routes that linked the East to the West. For several centuries, it was a prominent network that included both terrestrial and maritime routes. It stretched from East Asia, Southeast Asia, East Africa, West Africa, and Southern Europe. In order to explore its exact definition, history, and cultural significance, the following paragraphs will be written.\n\nThe Silk Road was not given its name for nothing. During its time of use, silk was a highly lucrative commodity along its routes. Silk, you can say, weaved together these many regions in terms of business and even cultural exchange. However, the name itself was not coined until the 19th century by Ferdinand von Richthofen. He made the term during his expeditions to China from 1868 to 1872. Despite this, the term was not made known to the academic world until the 20th century, when geographer Sven Hedin wrote a book titled “The Silk Road” in 1938. And finally, after the fall of the Soviet Union, academics in that region became involved increasingly in the study of the trade routes of Central Asia (“Silk Road in Rare Books”).\n\nThough China is often referred to as the central hub of the Silk Road, the history of the network began in Persia. According to the Ancient History Encyclopedia, “The history of the Silk Road pre-dates the Han Dynasty in practice, however, as the Persian Royal Road, which would come to serve as one of the main arteries of the Silk Road, was established during the Achaemenid Empire (500-330 BCE). The Persian Royal Road ran from Susa, in north Persia (modern day Iran) to the Mediterranean Sea in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) and featured postal stations along the route with fresh horses for envoys to quickly deliver messages throughout the empire. The Persians maintained the Royal Road carefully and, in time, expanded it through smaller side roads” (Mark, Joshua J.). After Alexander the Great conquered the Persians, and the Han Dynasty used western horses to win wars against the nomadic tribe Xiongnu, the trade routes the Persians made were then employed by China under the auspices of Emperor Wu. Knowing that the empire had won their battles due to a superior western horse, China opened up for trade—desiring to see what else they could gain (Mark, Joshua J.). This was just the start of centuries of extensive trade between dozens of nations and empires, which attracted everyone from the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, India, Mesopotamia, and other significant regions.\n\nWith all these areas joining in on trade, a cultural exchange was bound to happen. In fact, it is said that the first person to establish The Silk Road, General Zhang Qian, was on a diplomatic mission. According to UNESCO, “Cultural interaction was a vital aspect of material exchange. Moreover, many travelers ventured onto the Silk Roads in order to partake in this process of intellectual and cultural exchange that was taking place in cities along the routes. Knowledge about science, arts and literature, as well as crafts and technologies was shared across the Silk Roads, and in this way, languages, religions and cultures developed and influenced each other” (“Silk Roads Dialogue, Diversity & Development”). It can be said that the cultural exchange between nations was just as valuable as the trade of goods, or even more so. Establishing the Silk Road was one of the first steps towards globalization.\n\nThe cherished history of The Silk Road is one of global significance. Starting out as a Persian trading system of routes, after Persia fell under the might of Alexander the Great, China used parts of the original routes to bring grand cultural exchange and the trading of goods from far reaches of the East to the West to first benefit itself—later becoming advantageous for other nations. The Silk Route was used for about 500 years, and was perhaps the first large step towards globalization.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the theories about why we yawn?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Yawning is contagious, it is said. However, how much do we know about it? It is obviously a curiosity among millions of people, as one of the most searched-for queries on Google is “Why do we yawn?” There are multiple theories about why we yawn: to bring more oxygen into the blood and move more carbon dioxide out of the blood when our breathing slows (from being tired or bored), to stretch the lungs and lung tissue (to flex our muscles and joints, raise our heart rate, and be more awake), to redistribute surfactant to lubricate the lungs and to make sure they do not collapse, to react to someone else yawning as part of a contagious act, and to cool the brain.\n\nWhen we are tired or bored, our breathing tends to slow down. This dip in our breathing speed results in less oxygen in our blood. One of the main theories about yawning is that it is an involuntary act to bring more oxygen into the blood and move more carbon dioxide out of the blood. According to the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Georgia, “Dying gasps, deep breathing, yawns and sighs which are generally considered as respiratory acts, markedly increase venous return. In the presence of cardiac arrest, dying gasps pump blood through the lungs and temporarily provide blood flow to the vital areas, the central nervous system and heart. Effective net pressure as great as 50 mmHg in the pulmonary artery, 50 mmHg in the coronary arteries and 40 mmHg in the central nervous system arteries were created by dying gasps in dogs where cardiac action had ceased” (R. Woodbury, B. Abretj). Thus, yawning can be a key ingredient to expanded blood flow, combined with stretching. Excessive yawning can be a sign of a serious medical condition related to blood flow.\n\nAnother theory states that yawning is an act of stretching the lungs and lung tissue. Though stretching and yawning go hand in hand, yawning might be a type of stretch itself. This stretch acts as a way to flex our muscles and joints, increase our heart rate, and become more awake. Through this simple stretch, significant benefits are realized (“Why Do I Yawn?).\n\nYet another idea is that yawning lubricates the lungs. According to Everyday Mysteries, “By yawning, we help distribute surfactant (wetting agent) to coat the alveoli (tiny air sacs) in the lungs. Generally speaking, we cannot yawn on command. It is theorized that yawning is a semi-voluntary action and partly a reflex controlled by neurotransmitters in the hypothalamus of the brain” (“Why Do We Yawn?”). Some scientists even theorize that without yawning, our lungs would collapse. Yawning possibly is a lifesaver.\n\nAs we know, yawning is contagious. Yawning is also a part of a reflex action. As Live Science points out, “Human beings are highly social and suggestible; we watch each other and emulate one another. In one yawning study, scientists found that applying cold packs to the subjects’ heads almost eliminated contagious yawning. Nasal breathing, which also promotes brain cooling, had a similar effect” (Cicetti, Fred). So, even though yawning is highly contagious, this reflex action can be lessened or done away by routine solutions.\n\nLastly, there is a theory that yawning is done to cool the brain. Live Science states that, “In a recent paper published in the Journal of Medical Hypotheses, scientists Gary Hack of the University of Maryland and Andrew Gallup of Princeton University wrote that, during yawning, the sinuses act like bellows to cool off the brain. If you suffer from sinus congestion, you might yawn more” (Cicetti, Fred). Like a computer overheating, our brain often needs to cool down, and yawning is one thing that counteracts the heat of the brain.\n\nYawning seems like a simple act. Yet, there are many theories about why we yawn: to have more oxygen in the blood and to have more carbon dioxide out of the blood when we have slow breathing, to stretch our lungs and lung tissue, to distribute surfactant to lubricate the lungs, to react to something that is contagious, and to cool down our brain.###"}
{"prompt":"How did Ariana Grande become one of the most popular singers in the world?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Ariana Grande is one of the most popular singers and entertainers of the present generation. Her songs and music videos have reached the top of international charts, and she has countless devoted fans around the world. But how much do we know about this celebrity? In order to inform her fans and non-fans about her life, an overview of her rise to fame will be given in detail.\n\nGrande was born on June 26, 1993 in Boca Raton, Florida, to parents of Italian heritage. She is the daughter of Joan Grande, a CEO of a marine communications company, and Edward Butera, a graphic designer firm owner (Farber, Jim). However, the marriage of her parents did not last long, as they separated when Grande was about 8 years old (Goodman, Lizzy).\n\nThroughout her childhood, she acted in theater plays and musicals. She began to perform at the Fort Lauderdale Children’s Theater, and her first role as a main character was in the production of Annie (Geggis, Anne). In addition, she performed in musicals like The Wizard of Oz and Beauty and the Beast. At the age of 8, she also sang with South Florida’s Philharmonic, Florida Sunshine Pops, and Symphonic Orchestras. She had her first national television appearance singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” for the Florida Panthers. This all happened while she was studying at North Broward Preparatory School.\n\nAt 13 years of age, she already had aspirations to record an R&B album, but her managers were not keen on her making an album yet. Instead, she carried on with her acting and musical theater career by being in the Broadway production 13. She won a National Youth Theatre Association Award for her role in that play. Throughout being in the production, she was studying in school through distance learning, and even sang a few times at the famous jazz club Birdland (“Official Ariana Grande”).\n\nGrande got her breakthrough by being casted for Nickelodeon’s Victorious in 2009, with several of her co-stars from 13. Through the show, she became a teen idol, and followed up this acclaim by acting in the musical Cuba Libre in 2010. However, she felt that music, not acting was her true calling. She started to work on her debut in August of 2010, and got the help of voice coach Eric Vetro ti improve her vocals. Her first ever recording was on the soundtrack for Victorious: Music from the Hit TV Show for a song called “Give It Up.” While working on this track, Grande recorded covers of songs and uploaded them to YouTube. A friend of the CEO of Republic Records saw these videos, and the company was impressed by Grande’s vocals. She was signed by Republic Records in 2011, and they released a single of hers called “Put Your Hearts Up” (Erlewine, Stephen Thomas).\n\nHowever, Grande later expressed that she was not interested in the bubblegum pop genre, even though her single went certified gold. In between working on her first studio album, she voiced the fairy princess in the animated television series Winx Club, voiced the title role in the English dub of the animated film Snowflake, the White Gorilla, and sang on two more soundtracks for the show Victorious. In addition, Grande collaborated with British singer and songwriter Mika on the single “Popular Song,” starred as Snow White in the theater production A Snow White Christmas, played Amanda Benson in the Nickelodeon film Swindle, and acted in Nickelodeon’s Sam & Cat (EW.com).\n\nWith three years in the making, Yours Truly, Grande’s first studio album, was released on August 30, 2013. Grande wrote several of the songs on the album, and had a decent amount of creative direction. In September of 2013, the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album charts, having 138,000 copies sold in its first week. The album eventually sold 500,000 copies in the U.S., and more across the world, making it Grande’s first platinum album. Three singles of hers topped the charts, and she won “New Artist of the Year” from the American Music Awards in 2013, and “Breakthrough Artist of the Year” from the Music Business Association. She finished her highly successful The Listening Sessions tour, and by January of 2014, she was already working on her second album (Billboard).\n\nAriana Grande started out as a child actress and musical theater singer, and realized herself in singing R&B music, among other genres. She was a child prodigy and had good backing from managers throughout her career, making it easier to land roles in television series, films, and getting a record contract to sing. Now, through her talent and hard work, she has become one of the most influential and beloved singers in the world.###"}
{"prompt":"Why do cats purr?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It may be a surprise to you, but “why do cats purr?” is one of the most searched-for questions on the internet. We often wonder why our pets, especially cats, do certain things. Well, cats purr for an amazing variety of reasons: it can be a sign of happiness, pain, distress, needing rest, needing repair, and of hunger (when combined with meowing).\n\nPurring is firstly understood as a sign of contentment. The most obvious sign that a cat is happy is that it is doing this action. According to Purina, “Humans smile, dogs wag their tails and cats purr. All of us show our contentment in different ways. So it’s not surprising that when your cat is curled up beside you, or you are stroking them, they express their feelings by purring” (Righetti, Joanne). And interestingly, cats do not have an apparatus for this act. Purring is done by a rapid movement of the muscles in the voice box with the movement of the diaphragm as a combined process (Righetti, Joanne).\n\nIn addition, purring can be a sign that a cat is in pain. If the cat has changed its breathing, it is biting and scratching itself, its pulse changes, its eye changes, energy level is down, or it cannot move well, the cat may start purring as a healing mechanism. If a cat regularly purrs, it may increase its purring in light of its pain (Nicholas, Jason).\n\nThere is also a term called “inappropriate purring.” It is a form of relaxation for a cat when he or she is in distress. This is often seen when a cat is pregnant or giving birth to kittens. The mother cat will start purring to calm itself down and to ease herself through stressful circumstances. It may be akin to our act of humming, whistling, or other behaviors when we cannot seem to relax (Lindsay, Duncan).\n\nInterestingly, when a cat purrs it can also be a sign of it needing rest. The feline might be tired (even though we know cats sleep so much already) and will start purring to get itself to go to sleep or to calm down. Therefore, purring can be a mechanism for cats to put themselves to sleep when tired (Righetti, Joanne).\n\nThe purring of cats has been shown to be not only healthy for humans to listen to as a relaxation tool, but also cats employ their purring as self-healing mechanisms. According to Scientific American, “Although it is tempting to state that cats purr because they are happy, it is more plausible that cat purring is a means of communication and a potential source of self-healing” (Lyons A., Leslie). In fact, the purr of a cat decreases the symptoms of dyspnea, helps heal infections and swelling, heals bones, and heals muscles, tendones, and ligaments (“The Healing Power of the Cat Purr”). There are even more benefits associated with humans when hearing the purring of cats, such as the lowering of blood pressure.\n\nLastly, cats can purr because of hunger. But this type of purring is special. As WebMD explains, “When cats purr for food, they combine their normal purr with an unpleasant cry or mew, a bit like a human baby’s cry. Experts believe that we’re more likely to respond to this sound. They’ve found that people can tell the difference between the purrs, even if they aren’t cat owners” (“How Can I Tell If My Cat Is Purring Because It’s Hungry or Wants Something?”). This is probably an evolutionary trait and a learned response.\n\nFinally, we know the secret behind a cat’s purr. They do it out of happiness, pain, distress, wanting rest, needing repair, and hunger (with the help of a combined meow). So, the next time you hear your cat purr, you can remember these reasons and determine the state of your cat.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some reasons why dogs eat grass?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Surprisingly, this is one of the most searched-for questions on the internet: “why do dogs eat grass?” Another surprise is that the answer is not all that one-dimensional. There are several reasons why dogs consume grass: improving digestion, treating intestinal worms, fulfilling an unmet nutritional need, the taste of grass is good to them, and dogs get bored.\n\nPoor digestion is a common issue with dogs. According to WebMD, dogs sometimes consume grass to settle their indigestion. However, “Evidence suggests that most dogs that eat grass aren’t unwell beforehand, or at least they don’t seem so. In fact, fewer than 10% of dogs seem to be sick before eating grass, according to their owners. And grass-eating doesn’t usually lead to throwing up — less than 25% of dogs that eat grass vomit regularly after grazing” (“Why Dogs Eat Grass: Causes and Prevention”). So, the theory of dogs eating grass because of indigestion is not so relevant. It may happen only in rare cases.\n\nAnother reason dogs like to chew on grass is that they may have an intestinal worm. Consuming grass can be a natural cure for these worms. According to Psychology Today, “The plant material passes through the intestinal tract and the fibrous matter increases the intestinal contractions and wraps around the worms or nematodes which may be infecting the animal. In this way the grass helps to purge the system of these potentially harmful parasites. Although most pet dogs are free of such worms they nonetheless may still have that predisposition to eat grass which was helpful to their ancestors living in the wild” (“Why Dogs Eat Grass-a Myth Debunked”). So, dogs might not have these worms, but they are chewing on grass out of an evolutionary instinct. It is like a natural barrier against worms, regardless if the dogs have them or not.\n\nAlso, dogs can eat grass because they are missing a nutritional element in their diet. Dog food is often not enough for them to feel nutritionally satisfied. As stated by Cesar’s Way, “As natural scavengers, canines are programmed to search for nutrition anywhere they can find it. It could be fulfilling a nutritional need that his normal food isn’t, especially fiber” (“Why Dogs Eat Grass – and How to Prevent It”). Besides being instinctual to search for food and to grab what a dog can get, canines might be seeking out fiber. Sometimes dog food does not have enough fiber in it to satisfy dogs’ needs.\n\nDogs might also might be like us humans: they simply might enjoy the taste of grass. To them, it might be an indulgence. The Spruce Pets says, “It’s safe to assume that some dogs simply enjoy the flavor and texture of grass. The modern domestic dog has a limited diet in general, but its wild relatives continue to enjoy a diverse bounty of food. Coyotes, for example, typically eat vegetable matter found in the stomachs and intestines of prey animals” (“Is It Safe for Your Dog to Eat Grass?”). Your dog might just be a foodie, so to speak, and trying to enjoy the riches of the earth. Who knows—maybe your dog has a taste for grass.\n\nLastly, your dog might be bored when it eats grass. When dogs are bored, they often exhibit interesting behaviors. According to WebMD, “Pica is the technical term for the disorder characterized by eating things that aren’t food. Sometimes pica indicates that your dog has some type of nutritional deficiency, though it is often simply a sign of boredom, especially when practiced by puppies and younger dogs. Dogs eating grass is actually quite common (it has been observed in wild dogs, too, and may be completely natural) and this form of pica does not usually cause too many problems” (“Why Dogs Eat Grass: Causes and Prevention”). Thus, when your dog is chewing on grass, it might be a sign of a pica.\n\nOverall, the answer to the popular question, “why do dogs eat grass?” is founded on several factors: indigestion, intestinal worms, nutritional needs, enjoying the taste of grass, and boredom. It is difficult to determine which of these factors is involved in each dog, but understanding these reasons can bring comfort to a pet owner and treatment for the dog, if needed.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the eight reasons behind eye twitching?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Once in a while, we all get twitching eyes. Many times when this happens, we wonder about the reasons behind this phenomenon. In fact, “why is my eye twitching?” is one of the most searched questions on Google. The main reason behind the twitching of our eyes is eye irritation, eyelid strain, fatigue, a lack of sleep, physical exertion, the side effects of medication, stress, and the use of substances such as alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine.\n\nAn irritated eye is a common issue that is linked to the twitching of the eye. Specifically, irritation can occur on “the surface of your eye (cornea) or the membranes that line your eyelids (conjunctiva)” (“Blepharospasm: Why Does My Eye Keep Twitching? How Can I Stop It?”). This type of irritation is commonly caused by bacteria or the production of oil near the eye.\n\nSimilar to eye irritation is eyelid strain. According to Mayo Clinic, “Eyestrain is a common condition that occurs when your eyes get tired from intense use, such as while driving long distances or staring at computer screens and other digital devices” (“Eyestrain”). This is a common problem with the present generation due to our prolonged use of screens.\n\nGeneral fatigue is another clue as to why our eye is twitching. In particular, “Fatigue is a term used to describe an overall feeling of tiredness or lack of energy. It isn’t the same as simply feeling drowsy or sleepy. When you’re fatigued, you have no motivation and no energy. Being sleepy may be a symptom of fatigue, but it’s not the same thing” (“Eyelid Twitch: Causes, Treatments, and Prevention”). So, a lack of energy can lend to the twitch of our eye.\n\nIn a similar vein, a lack of sleep contributes to this issue as well. Getting less than the prescribed eight hours of sleep a night can cause eye twitching, though it usually takes a certain amount of time before this issue manifests. It may take a few days of getting six hours or less of sleep a day for it to be present (“Blepharospasm: Why Does My Eye Keep Twitching? How Can I Stop It?”).\n\nInterestingly, physical exertion can also be an explanation for the twitching of an eye. If one does too many sports, engages in manual labor too long, or does exercises to the extreme, eye twitching can occur. That is a good example of why it is important to be balanced in one’s physical exertion (“Eyelid Twitch: Causes, Treatments, and Prevention”).\n\nIn addition, some medications cause the twitching of eyes. According to WebMD, “Eye twitches can also be a side effect of certain medications. The most common include drugs that treat psychosis and epilepsy” (“What Medications Cause Eye Twitches?”). Therefore, it is good to be aware of the medications you take and if they cause eye twitching.\n\nA reason behind eye twitching that is a mixture of both physical and psychological impacts is stress. When we are stressed, our body can initiate an involuntary response that manifests as an eye twitch. This twitch itself can be stressful not only because we get tired of it happening, but also because we get worried about people seeing us with a fluttering eye (“Reduce Stress to Eliminate Eye Twitches”).\nLastly, eye twitching can happen due to the intake of alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine. All three can result in the nervous system going to extremes. Thus, when an imbalance in the nervous system occurs, eye twitching can be present (“Eyelid Twitch: Causes, Treatments, and Prevention”).\n\nThough the question “why is my eye twitching?” is a common query on Google, it cannot be summed up by one word or two. In fact, there are typically eight reasons behind this phenomenon: irritation of the eye, strain of the eyelid, fatigue, a neglect of sleep, physical exertion, side effects of medication, stress, and the employment of substances like alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the reasons behind the salt content of ocean water and seawater?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One of the most frequently searched questions on Google is “Why is the ocean salty?” Well, a better question might be, “why is any water in nature salty?” It is a pertinent question, as about 97% of Earth’s water is salty, which leaves us with not so much water to actually drink. This water also covers about 70% of the surface of Earth. In light of this importance, this essay will explore the reasons behind the salt content of ocean water and seawater.\n\nLet us go over the main question first: why is the ocean salty? To break it down simply, oceans become salty due to rocks on land. This seems like a strange answer but as the National Ocean Service explains, it is quite logical: “The rain that falls on the land contains some dissolved carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic due to carbonic acid (which forms from carbon dioxide and water). As the rain erodes the rock, acids in the rainwater break down the rock” (US Department of Commerce, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). To further explain, this process creates electrically charged atomic particles called ions. These ions go into streams and rivers and end up eventually in the ocean. A majority of these ions are messed with by organisms and are removed. However, some of the ions are left in the water and begin to build up into concentrations. The most common ions in ocean water and seawater are Chloride and Sodium, both of which are salty in taste.\n\nWhen this slightly acidic rain beats down on mineralized rocks and travels ultimately to the ocean, salty substances tend to remain. This process is called weathering. According to the University of Texas at Dallas, “Water evaporates from the oceans to fall again as rain and to feed the rivers, but the salts remain in the ocean. Because of the huge volume of the oceans, hundreds of millions of years of river input were required for the salt content to build to its present level” (Pujana, Ignacio). However, the saltiness of water is not only provided by water from rivers and streams.\n\nAnother reason ocean water becomes salty is due to hydrothermal vents. As the University of Texas at Dallas states, “About twenty years ago, features on the crest of oceanic ridges were discovered that modified our view on how the sea became salty. These features, known as hydrothermal vents, represent places on the ocean floor where sea water that has seeped into the rocks of the oceanic crust, has become hotter, and has dissolved some of the minerals from the crust, now flows back into the ocean. With the hot water comes a large complement of dissolved minerals” (Pujana, Ignacio). It is estimated that these hydrothermal vents have been in this process for millions of years, and are a partial result of the salinity of ocean water.\n\nLastly, the saltiness of water is also affected by submarine volcanoes. With the eruption of underwater volcanoes, the water reacts to the hot rock and a dissolving process happens where minerals are left in the water. However, it is difficult to measure how much of the salt in the ocean comes from this activity (Pujana, Ignacio).\n\nLakes have an additional element to them that makes their salt content more pronounced. These bodies of water could be said to be large depressions in a river channel, and some of them have only a small outlet, or no outlet at all. As the University of Texas at Dallas explains, “The Great Salt Lake, Dead Sea, and other salt lakes have no outlets. All the water that flows into these lakes escapes only by evaporation. When water evaporates, the dissolved salts are left behind” (Pujana, Ignacio). Though the ocean is in a static state in term of salinity, lakes like these will continue to increase in their salt content.\n\nTo summarize, the salt in oceans is caused by the collection of minerals from rain beating down on mineralized rocks and transposing these contents into streams and rivers that eventually meet the ocean, plus submarine volcanic activity and hydrothermal vents. Lakes have similar salt content due to these reasons, but also act as depressions where salt can easily collect due to a small outlet or no outlet at all. Lastly, evaporation sometimes aides in the process of keeping salt content stable or increasing it.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the difference between the net worth of Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Wealth is not that easy to calculate. In fact, most lists of the wealthiest people in the world do not add royalty or people whose wealth come from political positions. This is due to the fact that this kind of fortune is complex to calculate exactly. But as the amount of billionaires increases—there are 2,208 billions in the world at present—these excluded individuals from the lists of the wealthiest people continues to grow, and possibly exponentially. The net worth of billionaires has been climbing steadily for some time, and now the richest person in the world is undoubtedly Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of the company Amazon.\n\nAs of February, 2019, Jeff Bezos is the richest person in the world (Cannon, Christopher, et al.). This is agreed upon by the Bloomberg Billionaire Index and Forbes’ The World’s Billionaires. At present, his total net worth is 135 billion dollars (“The World’s Billionaires 2018”). As the founder and CEO of Amazon, he started the online bookstore in 1993 that later blew up into a global online retailer that has now branched out into many areas of technology. According to Bloomberg, “The Seattle-based publicly traded company operates retail websites Zappos and Audible, serves as a platform for third-party vendors, and provides cloud computing services. Amazon reported revenue of $233 billion in 2018” (Jeff Bezos). There is no certainty of which area of retail and technology Amazon might reach for next. Furthermore, Bezos’ wealth seems to not be slowing down in its increase.\n\nThe long-standing billionaire Bill Gates is the second richest person in the world with a total net worth of 97.5 billions dollars. According to Bloomberg, “Gates co-founded Microsoft, the world’s biggest software maker, and owns about 1 percent of the Redmond, Washington-based company. The rest of his fortune is managed through closely held Cascade Investment, which controls stakes in dozens of publicly traded companies, including Canadian National Railway, Deere and Ecolab” (Bill Gates). Though he owns very little of the company he founded, he has smartly invested in a variety of companies to keep his fortune afloat and thriving. However, it looks like Bezos has more potential for growth in terms of his wealth.\n\nAnother super famous billionaire tops the list, as the third richest person in the world goes to Warren Buffett with a total net worth of 84.3 billion dollars. In detail, Bloomberg writes, “Buffett is the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment group that’s delivered a 20.9 percent compounded annual gain in market value since 1953. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company owns Geico, Clayton Homes and Dairy Queen, and has stakes in Coca-Cola and American Express” (Warren Buffett). Basically, Buffett has his hands in many multinational companies that have had sustained growth over the years.\n\nFinally out of America, we have Bernard Arnault from France. His total net worth amounts to 80 billions dollars. According to Bloomberg, “France’s richest man is the chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest maker of luxury goods. He controls about half of LVMH, which had [a] revenue of 46.8 billion euros (55.3 billion) in 2018. It sells products including Louis Vuitton leather goods, TAG Heuer watches and Dom Perignon champagne” (Bernard Arnault). Like Bezos, his wealth his only growing and it would not be a surprise for him to be in the third or second place for the wealthiest person alive in the next few years.\n\nOverall, the richest person in the world is Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon. With a total net worth of 135 billion dollars as of February of 2019, Bezos beats Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, as he lags behind with 97.5 billion dollars. It looks like Bezos will keep his title as the wealthiest person in the world for some time, given the diversity of his investments and constant growth of Amazon.###"}
{"prompt":"Why is the sky blue?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The sky has always fascinated people. It is vast, epic, and sometimes seems otherworldly. Many religious people believe the heavens are in the sky or above it. But another aspect of the sky that has puzzled people over eons is its color. People often ask, “why is the sky blue?” In fact, it is one of the most frequently searched questions on Google. In order to address this question properly, this essay will give an in-depth answer to this age-old inquiry.\n\nWhat is interesting is that the light from the sun appears to be white when you catch a glimpse of it. However, this is not quite the fact. The light from the sun carries a variety of colors, which makes up a spectrum of colors. However, this white light of the sun is already separated when something reflects it, bends it, or scatters it. In fact, white light travels in a straight line, and when this light separates, it becomes wavy. These waves show up in different colors, with red being the least wavy, and blue being the most wavy.\n\nWhat does all this have to do with the color of the sky? Well, according to NASA, “Sunlight reaches Earth’s atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules of air in Earth’s atmosphere. Blue is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves” (“Why Is the Sky Blue?”). This explains why we see the sky as blue most of the time, though you can see it is almost an optical illusion.\n\nHowever, there are some nuances to this perception. As NASA states, “Closer to the horizon, the sky fades to a lighter blue or white. The sunlight reaching us from low in the sky has passed through even more air than the sunlight reaching us from overhead. As the sunlight has passed through all this air, the air molecules have scattered and rescattered the blue light many times in many directions” (“Why Is the Sky Blue?”). So, as you approach a horizon, the truth of the white light becomes more apparent.\n\nAnd what about sunsets? There are a variety of reasons why sunset is a time of myriad colors. According to the University of California, “When the air is clear the sunset will appear yellow, because the light from the sun has passed a long distance through air and some of the blue light has been scattered away. If the air is polluted with small particles, natural or otherwise, the sunset will be more red. Sunsets over the sea may also be orange, due to salt particles in the air, which are effective Tyndall scatterers” (ucr.edu). In addition, the sky around the sun is viewed as red, plus the light that directly emits from the sun. This is due to the fact that light scatters best through small angles, and blue light is easier to spread long distances,\n\nOther parts of the sky, such as clouds and dust, are seen as white for specific reasons as well. As the University of California puts it, “Clouds and dust haze appear white because they consist of particles larger than the wavelengths of light, which scatter all wavelengths equally” (Mie scattering) (ucr.edu). So, some things in nature refer back to the original color of light through the phenomenon of weight.\n\nThere are some instances where blue and red springs up in other natural phenomena other than the sky itself. As stated by the University of California, “Aerosols of terpenes from the vegetation react with ozone in the atmosphere to form small particles about 200 nm across, and these particles scatter the blue light. A forest fire or volcanic eruption may occasionally fill the atmosphere with fine particles of 500–800 nm across, being the right size to scatter red light.  This gives the opposite to the usual Tyndall effect, and may cause the moon to have a blue tinge since the red light has been scattered out” (ucr.edu). These instances are more rare but happen enough to make it a regular occurrence measured by science.\n\nThough the question “why is the sky blue?” is a seemingly childlike inquiry, it is not so easy to explain to a child. Basically, the sky is blue due to the white light (which actually is a spectrum of colors) of the sun being separated upon hitting Earth’s atmosphere, and blue light happens to spread much better than other colors of light due to its waviness. The sky changes color near the horizon, at sunset, in clouds, and other places due to the scattering of colors by material or angle.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the basics of the flu virus?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The flu is a common sickness around the world. People get it a few times a year, and it is not usually fatal. But what do people know about the flu? Most individuals do not know many details about this sickness that is a part of their lives seasonally. In order to address this, this essay will discuss the basics of the virus, its symptoms, complications, how it spreads, and its period of contagiousness.\n\nThe flu is a respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “There are two main types of influenza (flu) virus: Types A and B. The influenza A and B viruses that routinely spread in people (human influenza viruses) are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics each year. Influenza A viruses can be broken down into sub-types depending on the genes that make up the surface proteins” (“Influenza (Flu)”). During flu season, various kinds or brands of the virus spreads. The virus is known for its great variability, and that is the reason why it is so successful and longstanding.\n\nThe symptoms of the flu are the most visible signs that we have the virus. As stated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “People who are sick with flu often feel some or all of these symptoms: fever or feeling feverish\/chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue (tiredness), and some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults” (www.cdc.gov\/flu\/consumer\/symptoms.htm). If one has these symptoms, it can be said you have the flu almost without doubt.\n\nThese symptoms are normal, but complications when one has the flu are the most dangerous. According to WebMD, “They include viral or bacterial pneumonia, dehydration, and ear infections and sinus infections, especially in children. The flu can worsen long-term medical conditions, like congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes. You might also have muscle inflammation (myositis), problems with your central nervous system, and heart problems such as heart attacks, inflammation of the organ (myocarditis), and inflammation of the sac around it (pericarditis)” (“What Are Flu Complications?”). This shows one needs to take care of the flu before it reaches a critical point of damage and influence.\n\nBeing aware of how the flu spreads is also a vital aspect of the illness. Noted by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “People with flu can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away. Most experts think that flu viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs” (www.cdc.gov\/flu\/about\/disease\/spread.htm). Sometimes, the flu can also spread by someone touching an object that the virus has been in contact with, and then this individual rubs his or her eyes or touches his or her mouth.\n\nAdditionally, you can benefit by knowing the periods of contagiousness. VeryWell Health states that, “The typical flu incubation period—the time between exposure and the start of symptoms—is between 24 hours and four days, with the average being two days. This means that if you are exposed to the influenza virus and become infected, you will start to experience flu symptoms anywhere between 24 hours and four days after the exposure” (Duda, Kristina, and Sanja Jelic). This means that it is difficult to determine exactly when and how you acquire the flu.\n\nAs we have seen, the flu is a respiratory illness that is caused by the extremely adaptable and variable influenza virus. It has a variety of symptoms, such as coughing, runny nose, chills, and more. A flu can bring on complications as well, like infections and inflammation if one is not careful enough. The virus itself is exchanged through a host releasing it in liquid form by sneezing, coughing, and other methods. Lastly, the period of contagiousness is between 24 hours to four days. This basic information about the flu can help us ward against the danger of this common illness.###"}
{"prompt":"How did Meghan Markle go from being an actress to a member of the British royal family?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2018 was a big year for the royal family of the United Kingdom: Prince Harry married Meghan Markle, an American Actress. It caused a social media and news storm that caught the attention of almost every person in the world. But how much do we know about Meghan Markle? This essay will expound on the life of Markle and her rise to fame.\n\nShe was born as Rachel Meghan Markle on August 4, 1981, in Los Angeles, California. Her mother, Doria Ragland, is a social worker and yoga instructor, and her father, Thomas Markle Sr., is a television director of photography lighting director. However, the marriage did not last long after Meghan was born, as they divorced when she was six years old (John, Tara). Meghan has mixed heritage, as her mother is African-American and her father is Caucasian.\n\nWith her father working in television, she essentially grew up and is a product of Hollywood. Meghan often visited the set of Married… with Children. Besides being on television sets, she attended school in the area as well. Her first form of education started at the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse, which is a private school (Goulet, Matt). Around this time, at age 11, she made a successful campaign to make Procter & Gamble change one of their television commercials due to its sexist content. This was her first bit of fame, as Nick News picked up the story (Boedeker, Hal).\n\nDespite being raised Protestant, she went to an all-girl Catholic school, Immaculate Heart High School, in Los Angeles. After graduating from high school, she attended Northwestern University, and became a part of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, did community service, and worked on charity projects. During this time, she took up an internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In addition, she studied one semester in Madrid, Spain. Ultimately, she received a bachelor’s degree with a double major in theater and international studies (“Meghan Markle Exclusive”).\n\nA year before she graduated, Meghan got her first on-screen appearance on television on the show General Hospital as a nurse. Subsequently, she had guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006), and CSI: NY (2006). In between these opportunities, she did some contract acting and modeling—notably, as a “briefcase girl” on the gameshow Deal or No Deal. In 2008, she appeared in two episodes of the television series Fringe as a junior agent. But these early years were difficult for her in terms of her career, as she said, “Being ‘ethnically ambiguous’, as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role … Sadly, it didn’t matter: I wasn’t black enough for the black roles and I wasn’t white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn’t book a job” (France, Lisa Respers).\n\nHowever, she started to get more work in 2010, making appearances in the film Get Him to the Greek, and Remember Me. In the following year, she was in the film Horrible Bosses. During this time, she also was in episodes of Cuts; Love, Inc.; 90210; Knight Rider; Without a Trace; The League; and Castle. She landed a pivotal role in the series Suits in 2011 as a paralegal that eventually became an attorney. She was a part of the show up until the seventh season in 2017. The portrayal of her character won her fame and a stable income. While on the show, she started her own lifestyle website called The Tig, writing about various feminine topics. This endeavor proved to be lucrative, as she was earning $80,000 annually from her sponsors and endorsements (Town & Country).\n\nTo backtrack a bit, she started a relationship with actor and producer Trevor Engleson in 2004, and they eventually married in 2011 in Jamaica. But in only two years, the couple divorced. After this first marriage, she had about a two-year relationship with chef Cory Vitiello. By June of 2016, Meghan had begun a relationship with Prince Harry. Meghan and Harry met through a blind date set up by a mutual friend. Though rumors about their relationship were swirling around the internet and on the news, in September of 2017, the couple made their first public appearance together at the Invictus Games in Toronto, Canada (“Meghan Markle Attends as Prince Harry Launches Invictus Games”).\n\nAs a sidetrack, it is important to mention that Meghan has been involved in a vast array of charity work. At the 2014 summit One Young World, Meghan spoke about gender equality and modern-day slavery. In the same year, she went to Afghanistan and Spain with the United Service Organizations. Two years after, in 2016, she became a global ambassador for World Vision Canada. In this capacity, she travelled to Rwanda to participate in the Clean Water Campaign. In the same year, she went to India for raising awareness of women’s issues, and later wrote an op-ed for Time magazine about the stigmatization of menstrual health. In addition, she worked as an advocate for the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (Shepherd, Jack).\n\nBack to her relationship with British royalty, by November, 2017, Prince Harry and Meghan announced their engagement by Clarence House and Kingston Palace. Overall, there was a positive reception to their engagement, and the black community in the UK and around the world were generally happy to have the possibility of someone of African descent be in the royal family. Shortly after the engagement, Meghan announced that she would retire from acting and she started the process of becoming a British citizen. She then got baptized into the Church of England in order to be in the upcoming wedding. To much excitement and press, the wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan happened on May 19th of 2018 at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle (NBCNews.com). With her marriage, she became a princess of the United Kingdom, the Duchess of Sussex, Countess of Dumbarton, and Baroness Kilkeel. She is formally called “Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex.”\n\nAfter the wedding, the first engagement she participated in as a Duchess was on May 22, celebrating the charity of work of Prince Charles. In July, The British Government requested her to visit Dublin, Ireland. Meghan is now a youth ambassador to the Commonwealth alongside Harry. In this capacity, she visited Australia, Fiji, Tonga, and New Zealand in October of 2018. Though the royal family has a low level of support in these regions, Meghan was well-received in these areas. At present, Meghan and Harry live at Nottingham Cottage in London, where they are expecting their first child.\n\nMeghan Markle was born into the lap of Hollywood, graduated from university with a degree in theater and international studies, to later become a famous actress after struggling for about 10 years to land a feature role on television. After a failed marriage and another unsuccessful relationship, she went on a blind date with Prince Harry, and they soon got engaged and married. The well-known American television actress is now the first person of the royal family of the United Kingdom of African heritage, being the Duchess of Sussex, the wife of the Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry.###"}
{"prompt":"How did the fidget spinner become a global phenomenon?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A fidget spinner is a toy that became extremely popular in 2017, and has continued to be in use. It has been promoted as a helper for people with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and other psychological issues dealing with anxiety. However, these claims have not been substantiated by science. The following paragraphs will discuss the origin, design, marketing and sales, and cultural significance of the fidget spinner in depth.\n\nThe beginnings of fidget spinners is a bit unclear. Based on the information from Fidget Spinner Review, “According to many, the spinner’s inventor is Catherine Hettinger. However a good explanation on the true inventor, as in who would be able to patent the invention with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, reveals that the typical fidget spinner’s embodiment is outside the patent claims of Catherine’s and a thorough patent search by David Miller revealed many fascinating toys with nearly identical structures but the ability for engaging the user’s fingertips on both sides of the device simultaneously may have existed previously, including rotationally symmetrical lobes and bearing hubs on both sides such as shown in figure five of US patent 8,727,630” (Fidget Spinner Review). Thus, despite many claims, Hettinger was not the original creator of the fidget spinner.\n\nNow that we have gone over the origin of this toy, it is vital to go over its design. Its ball bearing core allows the arms of the spinner to spin freely. The bearing is contained within a circular pad, and this is where the user holds the fidget spinner with one hard, usually. The spinners are made from a variety of materials, such as brass, plastic, copper, aluminum, stainless steel, and more. The bearings are composed of ceramic metal and different metals. Besides the bearing, the weights contained within the arms make spinning practically effortless and keeps the momentum going. Each bearing can be adjusted to vary the spin time, noise, and vibration of the spinner. The design makes the fidget spinner not only easy to use, but almost hypnotic in its movement (Arnett, Dugan).\n\nSince we have gone over the basics of the origin and design of this toy, it is time to discuss the marketing and sales of the fidget spinner. It has been marketed in a variety ways, despite its simple design. It has been described as a health product for eliminating the tension and anxiety of children, as a product that produces calming fun, and as a business tool for people who are overworking and need relief. The sales have been high and the reselling value is sometimes astronomical. According to Startup Mindset, “Companies are buying them from China for $1.40 and reselling them for $20. The cheap fidget spinners that retail for about $20 in North America are an out of control success. The Chinese continue to manufacture and send abundant supplies into the U.S., and Canada and stores still can’t hold onto them” (“Here’s How Brilliant Marketing Helped the Fidget Spinner Rise in Popularity”). In fact, there were so many sales, that in some schools, they were banned due to their ubiquitousness in classrooms.\n\nLastly, the cultural significance of the fidget spinner is essential to tackle when discussing this toy. According to The Atlantic, “It is a toy for the hand alone—for the individual. Ours is not an era characterized by collaboration between humans and earth—or Earth, for that matter. Whether through libertarian self-reliance or autarchic writ, human effort is first seen as individual effort—especially in the West” (Bogost, Ian). So, before, tops toys made a connection with the earth and humanity, but now these types of toys are increasingly individual-centric.\n\nFidget spinners became a global phenomenon in 2017. It is a simple toy or tool that spins by the flick of a finger. It has been promoted as a thing that can calm people down, soothe anxiety, and be used as a source of entertainment. Though science has not proven any of their benefits, people continue to use them for stress reduction and an escape from boredom.###"}
{"prompt":"How did Stan Lee's work inspire a new generation of artists and what was his legacy?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" As the former editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, Stan Lee had a great influence on the comic book world and within his esteemed company. From Spider-Man, Iron Man, Black Panther, the X-Men, and many more, Lee created countless enduring superhero characters that have taken the world by storm. In fact, there is not much of Marvel that has not been developed or supervised by Lee. His work is often remembered not just because of his imagination, but also his emotionality. Although he passed away in 2018, Lee will be remembered for his grounded and complex characters that inspired and captured the imagination millions of fans.\n\nThough his legacy is secured as astounding and deeply influential, Lee’s creations often took a while to become popular. According to IGN, “Thor was elevated by creators like Walt Simonson, who tapped more deeply into the mythic quality of Asgard and its gods. Black Panther needed someone like Christopher Priest to really capture the struggles faced by an African king who occasionally masquerades as a superhero. Daredevil only became what he is now after Frank Miller went to Marvel and re-imagined him as a tortured ninja hero” (Schedeen, Jesse). But this type of collaboration is key in the artistic world, especially in the sphere of comic books. Lee was said to contribute mostly with his humor, epic storytelling style, and his marketing wizardry. In combination with other creators’ talents, his work flourished.\n\nYet, in the case of Spider-Man, Lee and his team struck gold from day one. As stated by IGN, “Only with Spider-Man do those original Lee\/Ditko stories remain the gold standard by which all others are judged. Everything from Peter Parker’s background as a nerdy outcast to the rich cast of allies and enemies combined to create the perfect storm of comic book storytelling” (Schedeen, Jesse). But rarely does any creative project come to fruition so quickly. His main legacy may not be the creation of so many iconic comic characters, but how he inspired others to create their own characters and to treat characters’ worlds with care.\n\nBefore Lee, comic book characters were usually less complex and worldly. According to Hollywood Reported, “Beginning in the 1960s, the irrepressible and feisty Lee punched up his Marvel superheroes with personality, not just power. Until then, comic book headliners like those of DC Comics were square and well-adjusted, but his heroes had human foibles and hang-ups; Peter Parker\/Spider-Man, for example, fretted about his dandruff and was confused about dating. The evildoers were a mess of psychological complexity” (Barnes, Mike). This sense of reality in the superhuman world brought untold benefits to the Marvel franchise, as the comics were later adapted into blockbuster films that connected with audiences worldwide not only due to their imagination, but also their emotionality.\n\nA lot of this emotionality had to do with fighting for justice in terms of civil rights. In fact, one can say his best work was created at a time when civil rights was at the forefront of the news and people’s attention in the United States of America. According to the BBC, “From The Fantastic Four to the X-Men, his heroes were outsiders who fight for a better society – no surprise given they were created during the height of the civil rights movement. X-Men has often been praised for its portrayal of mutant oppression and its reflection of the fight for civil rights. Alongside his long-time collaborator Jack Kirby, Lee also created Black Panther, the first black superhero to appear in comics” (Rumble, Taylor-Dior). Just recently, the film adaption of Black Panther became the most successful Marvel release at the box office. This sends a message to black people that they can be powerful, important, and smart.\n\nStan Lee can be said to be the godfather of modern comic books. With his grounded, complex characters that went beyond normal comic book heroes, he wove epic stories that captured the imagination of readers and inspired a new generation of artists to breathe new life into the genre. From Spider-Man, X-Men, Black Panther, Iron Man, and more, Lee and his team created characters that will last and inspire for generations to come.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the seven stages of gaslighting?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Gaslighting is now a popular term for a type of manipulative behavior to control people or gain the offensive. There are many warning signs of gaslighting: telling exaggerated lies, denying saying something even with proof on hand, attacking what is dear to people, wearing people down, actions not matching words, using positive reinforcement to confuse victims, using confusion to weaken victims, projecting the weakness of gaslighters on others, trying to get people against a victim, telling others they are crazy, and saying everyone else is a liar (“11 Warning Signs of Gaslighting”). Besides these warning signs, there are seven stages of gaslighting this essay will discuss: lie and exaggerate, repetition, escalate when challenged, get the victim worn down, make codependent relationships, give false hope, and domination.\n\nThe gaslighter opens his or her strategy with lying and exaggerating about something. According to Psychology Today, “The gaslighter creates a negative narrative about the gaslightee (“There’s something wrong and inadequate about you”), based on generalized false presumptions and accusations, rather than objective, independently verifiable facts, thereby putting the gaslightee on the defensive” (“7 Stages of Gaslighting in a Relationship”). So, they usually stretch facts to land a false claim on someone. Many times, this is done after the gaslighter has been attacked or damaged in terms of self-image.\n\nThe second stage of gaslighting is repetition. In order to make the victim question reality, this is done. Stated by Life Advancer, “Does your partner use the same phrases repeatedly when you question them? Repeating phrases is a classic brainwashing tactic. They make you think in the way the brainwasher wants” (“What Is Gaslighting and How to Recognize If Your Partner Is Using It to Manipulate You”). Even if people know something is a blatant lie, if something is repeated enough, people may start believing in it.\n\nThe third stage is the gaslighter being challenged and escalating claims. According to Psychology Today, “When called on their lies, the gaslighter escalates the dispute by doubling and tripling down on their attacks, refuting substantive evidence with denial, blame, and more false claims (misdirection), sowing doubt and confusion” (“7 Stages of Gaslighting in a Relationship”). There is almost always a backlash from the victim, and the gaslighter does his or her best to increase the pressure to ensure his or her control is not lost.\n\nAs the fourth stage, after the escalation and numerous claims being repeated, the victim starts to get worn down. This is the plan of the gaslighter all along. According to Allison Goldfire from Pinups for Mental Health Awareness, “They use time to gradually wear you down. This is what makes gaslighting so effective. Lies sprinkled into conversation, snide remarks here and there to start, then upping the intensity and frequency” (“‘Gaslighting Epidemic’ by Allison Goldfire”). Thus, over time, these remarks accumulate into a psychological condition for the victim and this condition makes it easier for the gaslighter to do his or her work on the victim.\n\nAt the fifth stage, the condition of the victim is now solidified. Then, codependent relationships are created. As Psychology Today states, “In a gaslighting relationship, the gaslighter elicits constant insecurity and anxiety in the gaslightee, thereby pulling the gaslightee by the strings. The gaslighter has the power to grant acceptance, approval, respect, safety, and security. The gaslighter also has the power (and often threatens to) take them away” (“7 Stages of Gaslighting in a Relationship”). Thus, a codependent relationship is founded on fear, being vulnerable, and feeling marginalized.\n\nThe sixth stage of gaslighting is giving false hope. It is common for gaslighters to suddenly act better or act very positive with their victims in order to show they can be good after all. This makes victims consider the gaslighters as possibly good people. But this is often a tactic of the gaslighter to start the next round of gaslighting (“7 Stages of Gaslighting in a Relationship”).\n\nThe final stage of gaslighting is domination. According to Psychology Today, “At its extreme, the ultimate objective of a pathological gaslighter is to control, dominate, and take advantage of another individual, or a group, or even an entire society. By maintaining and intensifying an incessant stream of lies and coercions, the gaslighter keeps the gaslightees in a constant state of insecurity, doubt, and fear. The gaslighter can then exploit their victims at will, for the augmentation of their power and personal gain” (“7 Stages of Gaslighting in a Relationship”). There are degrees of narcissism, and its peak, a narcissist has no care for others except to control them.\n\nIn review, gaslighting is a manipulative behavior to make victims question their reality. There are seven stages of gaslighting: lying and exaggerating about things, repeating claims, escalating this behavior when challenged, wearing down the victim, creating codependent relationships, supplying false hope, and dominating. If you are in a relationship with a gaslighter, or a gaslighter yourself, get professional help.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some effective methods for visual learners?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are some people that identify as visual learners. These people are more prone to learn better through visual representation and strategies than from textual sources and the like. They are grouped in more of a “see it to believe it” type personality. There are several main ways that visual learners engage with information. These are taking notes during lectures or presentations, writing outlines, representing information in graphs\/charts\/diagrams, marking sources of information, and memorizing data through flashcards.\n\nTaking notes can be an art when you are a visual learner. Bullet points, the Cornell Method, mind maps, the flow method, and writing about slides can all be ways to make notes more visually appealing. Bullet points allow us to organize and absorb information by seeing it in a point-by-point manner. With the Cornell Method, you can split a page into two sections based on the categories that will be learned. This allows us to easily filter certain data in our minds. For more abstract visual learners, mind mapping certain topics and ideas is ideal. Also, in the same vein, the flow method involves drawing and shapes to show how a certain idea unfolds. And finally, writing about slides of a presentation enables one to remember information easier and to focus on certain chunks of data (UOS Assistive Technology).\n\nLike notes, outlines can be a strong visual tool as well. Writing outlines for papers and reports allows one to visually organize your main points paragraph by paragraph. It is useful to have outline with you at all times of the writing process in order to keep you on track and to stay concentrated (Roell, Kelly).\n\nUsing graphs and other visual representations of data is commonly said to be a great method of learning new information. According inspiration.com, “Venn diagrams, bar graphs, pie graphs and axis plots offer students multiple ways to visualize and investigate data. As students organize and analyze data, they ask meaningful questions and dig deeper to solve problems. Moving beyond simply memorizing facts, students acquire the skills of reasoning, inquiry and communication” (“Teaching and Learning with Plots and Graphs”). As you can see, visual representations of data allow a student to involve many areas at once to create a memorable and powerful learning experience.\n\nIn addition, interacting with your sources of information can lead to great visual learning. When flipping through your textbook, mark it up with notes, colorful stickers, and highlights to better absorb information and mark where certain information is. Treating your sources as something to be played with and involved with visually will increase your chances to memorize data and to be conversant in it.\n\nLastly, flashcards are an often-used tool for memorizing important facts, figures, and other information. According to Mometrix Test Preparation, “Visual learners need to see something in front of them before they can truly understand it. A teacher can lecture all day to visual learners, but until the information is written down they will not begin to consolidate it into memory. A flashcard is the perfect medium, then, for a visual learner, because it presents the essence of an idea or concept in a clear and precise image. Whether a flashcard contains text, pictures, or a combination of the two, it is in an ideal format for visual learners” (“Learning Styles”). Flashcards are even good for entering information into your subconscious.\n\nThere are several fine visual learning techniques that one can employ. In particular, taking stylized notes, composing outlines, displaying information in graphs\/charts\/diagrams, interacting with sources of information, and using flashcards are all great methods of retaining data in our minds. Doubtless, there are many others that have not been mentioned. Yet, these are the most effective and essential ones that students can use during their school day and for their homework.###"}
{"prompt":"Stephen Hawking's Life\n\nWhat are some key events in Stephen Hawking's life?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Stephen Hawking (1942 – 2018) is perhaps the most well-known physicist of his generation. He became a best-selling author of non-fiction, and popularized science worldwide. Hawking also battled with ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) for over 50 years, and became a champion of not only science, but also of the disabled. Despite this information being common knowledge, the majority of people do not know much about his personal life and career. In order to enlighten the public about this great man’s life, this essay will expound on Hawking’s timeline.\n\nHawking was born on the 8th of January, 1942, in Oxford, England, to Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking. Frank was a medical researcher, and Isobel was a secretary for a medical research institute. Stephen had two younger sisters, Phillipa and Mary, as well an adopted brother, Edward. The family was considered intelligent and a tad eccentric. Each family member was an avid reader, and they lived a frugal life in a cluttered house (Ferguson, Kitty).\n\nThe famed physicist began his education at the Byron House School in Highgate, London. It was a progressive school, and Hawking later said that this institution did not allow him to read properly. Later, he attended the St Albans High School for Girls for a few months (at that time, boys were allowed to attend some of the courses). In turn, he attended two independent schools called Radlett School and St Albans School after passing the eleven-plus examination one year early. His father wanted him to attend the prestigious Westminster School, but at 13 years old, Hawking was seriously ill on the examination day for the institution’s scholarship. The family did not have enough money to attend the school without the scholarship, so Hawking stayed in the lower-class schools. However, young Hawking enjoyed his friends in his school, who would play board games together, make fireworks, construct model airplanes and boats, and have extensive conversations about religion and spirituality. Though Hawking was not initially a bright student, he showed great aptitude in mathematics and science. Despite his father wanting him to follow the path of medicine, he garnered a scholarship to study at Oxford University on March, 1959, to study physics and chemistry (there was no chance to study mathematics back then at Oxford) (Fraser, Gordon, et al.).\n\nAt the age of 17, in October of 1959, Hawking began his bachelor’s studies. The first 18 months were very easy for him, and he barely studied. But around the second or third year of his B.A. studies, he became more involved in school. He joined the rowing team, and found many friends with his wit and brash character. Hawking said later that he studied only 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford. For the final exam, he answered only theoretical physics questions, and did not answer any questions that dealt with facts. The examiners of the test made him take an oral examination to place him in either second-class honors or first-class honors, which would determine where he would take up his doctorate studies. The examiners determined he was exceptionally bright, despite his apparent “lazy” academic record, and they gave him permission to attend Cambridge for his graduate studies by giving him first-class honors in physics (Ferguson, Kitty).\n\nAfter taking a short trip to Iran with a friend, he started his graduate studies at Cambridge on October of 1962. He was disappointed by being given Dennis William Sciama, a famous cosmologist, as a supervisor instead of astronomer Fred Hoyle. In addition to this, he thought the mathematical studies he engaged in was not good enough to work in general relativity and cosmology. Also, tragedy struck: he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease and he became depressed. He felt that working on physics would be worthless with a lack of time, as doctors gave him only two years to live. He began to have trouble walking and speaking, but the predictions of the doctors started to show to be untrue, and he got back to his studies with the encouragement of his supervisor.\n\n(excerpt)###"}
{"prompt":"What is the earliest record of martial arts?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The martial arts, being systems and traditions of combat, are not exclusive to Asian countries in their history. In fact, though Asian countries had a significant impact on martial arts, it was not until much later from its origins that martial arts took hold and spread through Asian countries. The first record related to martial arts is in Africa. This essay will discuss the timeline of martial arts in the following paragraphs in detail.\n\nAn exact timeline is difficult to compose, though with ample evidence, we can say how the general trend went. The earliest known instances and usage of martial arts comes from art, literature, and artifacts. The oldest living artifact connected to martial arts is dated as far as 3400 BC, which was an ancient Egyptian painting that displays a struggle (Czerwińska-Pawluk Iwona, and Żukow Walery). This fresco showed military training at Beni Hassan, an ancient Egyptian cemetery site. The type of martial arts practiced in this area was primarily wrestling and dueling with sticks. However, evidence has been found that the soldiers sparred with spears, shields, clubs, axes, poleaxes, flails, bows, slings, and various swords.\n\nHowever, the spear has been in use since the Lower Paleolithic (dating back to 3.3 million years) and is still an important piece of weaponry. The bow came about in the Upper Paleolithic (dating back to 50,000 years ago), and gradually was substituted by the crossbow. Bladed weapons began to appear in the Neolithic, such as the stone axe (starting 12,000 years ago), and were refined and diversified in the Bronze Age (around 3,300 BC) with various kinds swords, daggers, and other blades (“History of the Spear”).\n\nBut getting back on the general timeline, after Egyptians were sparring with wrestling and a variety of weapons, it can be seen that the ancient Babylonians were creating reliefs and literature based on martial struggle around 3000 BC. Also, around the same time in Vietnam, drawings and sketches were made about 2879 about fighting with spears, swords, sticks, and bows (Czerwińska-Pawluk Iwona, and Żukow Walery). However, hardly any background detail is known about these pieces of art.\n\nThe next significant artifact that points to the development of martial arts is from China. At 2698 BC, the Yellow Emperor was recorded to be a general who wrote a great deal about martial arts before becoming the leader of China. As ChinaCulture.org states, “According to tradition, the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi, traditional date of ascension to the throne 2698 BCE) introduced the earliest forms of martial arts to China. He allegedly developed the practice of jiao di or horn-butting and utilized it in war” (“History of Chinese Martial Arts”). However, despite his lengthy treatises, the historicity of the events and practices cannot be fully validated.\n\nThe following marker in the history of martial arts was the Epic of Gilgamesh. It is a poem from ancient Mesopotamia, written around 2100 BC. It is sometimes regarded as the earliest surviving work of literature. According to History on the Net, “The Epic of Gilgamesh” conveys many themes important to our understanding of Mesopotamia and its kings. Themes of friendship, the role of the king, enmity, immortality, death, male-female relationships, city versus rural life, civilization versus the wild and relationships of humans and gods resound throughout the poem. Gilgamesh’s many challenges throughout the poem serve to mature the hero and make him a good king to his people” (“The Epic of Gilgamesh”). In this long poem, many fights and duels among the characters were described and have a place in actual history.\n\nIn terms of epicness, the Olympic Games of Greece are hard to find a comparison. The Olympic Games began in 776 BC, and early events included wrestling, boxing, and pankration (“The Penn Museum”). A similar philosophy with the modern Olympics was held in its ancient form, with warring regions putting aside their conflicts while engaging in the Games.\n\nThere is much more detail and history that could added to this account, but this is the most basic timeline of martial arts. The earliest records and\/or signs of martial arts is from ancient Egypt, around 3400 BC with figurative art and painting displaying military training. However, remains of spears, blades, and other weapons were dated before this time. From Africa, martial arts travelled to Babylonia, and eventually sprung up in Asia, starting from Vietnam, and finally ended up in Europe in Greece with the Olympic Games.###"}
{"prompt":"How can I lose weight?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" “How to lose weight” is one of the top search questions on Google. There is a definite reason for this: not only do many people feel unsatisfied with their weight, but there is a global obesity epidemic happening now. There are also definite ways to cut down on your weight: eat less sugars and starches, lift weights three times a week and be physically active in general, get enough sleep, eat regular meals with a focus on less carbs, and increase your metabolism through appropriate foods.\n\nCutting down on sugars and starches is difficult, but it is perhaps the best first step. These elements are very tasty and common, but controlling your intake of these factors will significantly reduce your weight. According to Heathline, “The most important part is to cut back on sugars and starches (carbs). When you do that, your hunger levels go down and you end up eating much fewer calories. Now instead of burning carbs for energy, your body starts feeding off of stored fat” (“How to Lose Weight Fast: 3 Simple Steps, Based on Science”). It is said that within the first week of this diet, one can lose up to 10 pounds. This reflects both body fat and water weight.\n\nSpeaking of weight, it is important to lift them in order to shed some pounds. Being physically active in general helps, but lifting weights can work on body fat more intensely. According to My Fitness Pal, “Your best bet for fat loss will be to perform a combination of cardio and strength training. After all, one study in BMC Public Health found overweight and obese adults who followed a 12-week cardio and resistance-training program lost more weight than those who only did cardio” (“Can Lifting Weights Help You Lose Fat?”). Also of note is that lifting weights increases testosterone and growth hormone, which makes you lose fat easier eventually. Besides, these hormonal effects increases your good mood and promotes a more positive body image.\n\nLike many areas of health, getting enough sleep is vital. Unsurprisingly, a lack of sleep has been connected to weight gain and unhealthy weight in general. As stated by Healthline, “People with short sleep duration tend to weigh significantly more than those who get adequate sleep.\nIn fact, short sleep duration is one of the strongest risk factors for obesity. In one extensive review study, children and adults with short sleep duration were 89% and 55% more likely to become obese, respectively” (“10 Reasons Why Good Sleep Is Important”). As it can be seen, sleep has a large impact on our weight gain and loss. Besides, it is nice to feel well-rested.\n\nIt is also important to eat well. There is no need to starve yourself to lose weight. In fact, this is a rather unhealthy way to lose weight. It is best to eat regular meals that are focused on a low-carb diet. This way, your body will receive the nourishment it needs, and also your metabolism can be stable (“How to Lose Weight Fast: 3 Simple Steps, Based on Science”).\n\nFurthering on the topic of metabolism, it has a significant impact on how we lose and gain weight. Eating the right foods that will increase our metabolism undoubtedly helps us to lose some pounds. Foods such as almonds, beans, berries, bone broth, celery, chia seeds, chocolate, apple cider vinegar, cinnamon, coconut oil, coffee, curry, fish, grapefruit, green tea, hot peppers and jalapenos, lean turkey, seaweed, spinach, watermelon, and water are all sources of nourishment that boosts metabolism (Monaco, Emily). Of course we should not overindulge in these foods. However, eating these items regularly will increase our metabolism and promote weight loss.\n\nWeight loss can be a difficult journey. However, by consuming less sugars and starches, lifting weights a few times a week, getting great sleep, eating regular meals with less carbs, and increasing metabolism through the foods we take in, we can manage to lose weight and be healthy at the time. Losing weight should not be suffering, but rather a conscious decision we stick to.###"}
{"prompt":"How does the Theory of Relativity work?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Albert Einstein’s most famous contribution to physics, the Theory of Relativity, is known by name around the world, but the majority of people do not know about it in depth. This is because the theory is relatively difficult to grasp. Most people do not even know that the thoery encompases two interralted theories: special relativity and general relativity. Therefore, the following paragraphs will aid people in knowing more about this essential theory of physics.\n\nFirstly, we need to understand the difference between the two theories encapsulated in the Theory of Relativity. Special relativity is the first component of the main theory. According to Space.com when explaining special relativity, “Simply put, as an object approaches the speed of light, its mass becomes infinite and it is unable to go any faster than light travels. This cosmic speed limit has been a subject of much discussion in physics, and even in science fiction, as people think about how to travel across vast distances. The theory of special relativity explains how space and time are linked for objects that are moving at a consistent speed in a straight line” (Howell, Elizabeth). This theory is based on two postulates proposed by Einstein in a paper called “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies”:\n\n1) The laws of physics are invariant (i.e., identical) in all inertial systems (i.e., non-accelerating frames of reference).\n\n2) The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.\n\nThe theory of special relativity is the most accurate model of motion when the influence of gravity is barely traceable. It also has many consequences, one of which is time being perceived not as absolute, but rather dependent on a frame of reference and position in space.\n\nMoving on to the theory of general relativity, it is now the modern description of gravitation. It gives us a unified look at gravitation, as it generalizes special relativity and Newton’s law of universal gravitation. According to New Scientist, “it explains that what we perceive as the force of gravity in fact arises from the curvature of space and time. Einstein proposed that objects such as the sun and the Earth change this geometry. In the presence of matter and energy it can evolve, stretch and warp, forming ridges, mountains and valleys that cause bodies moving through it to zigzag and curve” (“Instant Expert: General Relativity”). So, the existence of matter in spacetime influences whatever is around it in the form of gravity. The curvature of spacetime is essentially gravity.\n\nThe Theory of Relativity has many implications. First of all, the famous equation E=mc2 means that energy is mass times the speed of light squared. This elegant equation showed that mass and energy are interchangeable (“Today in Science: Albert Einstein and E=Mc2.”). The theory also infers the fact of time dilation, which is “The slowing of the passage of time experienced by objects in motion relative to an observer; measurable only at relativistic speeds” (Boundless). Therefore, if one person is going at a higher velocity than another person for a certain period of time, the person who is experiencing a lower velocity will measure time differently. The person who spent time at a higher velocity will measure time in a shorter manner. In addition, length contraction is implied by the Theory of Relativity. If an object moves at a rate close to the speed of light, or significant fractions of that speed, the object can be observed as being shorter. This is an actual, observable shortness of length. However in its zero-velocity state, its length would return to normal.\n\nAbove were just a few implications of the theory. There is so much more to discuss, as one can imagine. However, for the purpose of this essay, let us backtrack and redefine the Theory of Relativity. It is a combination of special relativity (basically, when matter approaches the speed of light, its mass becomes infinite and cannot go faster than the speed of light) and general relativity (gravity is the curvature of spacetime through the presence of matter). This is the most basic breakdown of the theory, but it has changed how we look at classical physics and our physical universe.###"}
{"prompt":"How much waste does the world produce every year, and how is this affecting the environment?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The world has a waste problem. This is known by virtually everyone on the planet, but hardly anyone cares to look at the exact figures and to face the reality of what is coming in terms of the condition of our home: Earth. In order to highlight how much waste us humans produce, the following paragraphs will be written in detail.\n\nFirst, let us start with the yearly count. According to The World Counts, “Every year we dump a massive 2.12 billion tons of waste. If all this waste was put on trucks they would go around the world 24 times” (“Tons of Waste Dumped – Globally, This Year”). Not only is this amount unprecedented and is only getting worse every year due to population growth, the majority of countries are not dealing with waste properly. For instance, the United States is known for producing the largest amount of garbage in the world. “The U.S. consumes 30 percent of the world’s resources despite making up only 5 percent of the world’s population. It also produces 30 percent of the world’s waste. In only a year, Americans throw away around 26,800,000 tons of food, 8,550,000 tons of furniture and furnishings, 6,330,000 tons of clothing and footwear, and tons of other waste” (“Top 10 Countries that Produce the Most Waste”). Therefore, it can be said that the United States is the main problem-country to regulate in terms of waste production.\n\nAnother disturbing note is that 99 percent of the materials we purchase our thrown away within six months (“Tons of Waste Dumped – Globally, This Year”). This is caused by the capitalist idea of wanting to always have something new and fashionable, instead of something old. Also, producers of materials sometimes make sure that products do not last long. This phenomenon is called planned obsolescence (The Economist).\n\nWith this much being thrown away and at such a rapid rate, the future looks dim. The World Bank reports that, “Without urgent action, global waste will increase by 70 percent on current levels by 2050, according to the World Bank’s new What a Waste 2.0:  A Global Snapshot of Solid Waste Management to 2050 report” (World Bank). This is important to take in, as all this waste harms human health, natural environments, and speeds up climate change. The poorest nations, unfortunately will be hit the hardest by the increasing amount of garbage due to their lack of proper waste management systems, population growth, and uninformed populace about how to handle waste.\n\nLooking farther into the future, when will be the peak of our waste? In other words, when will waste production be so high, that its effects will be irreversible? Around the year 2100, the peak of our waste production is estimated to come. By this time, the world will be covered in trash, with no more space for landfills, and the burning of waste either being too harmful for the environment or not enough to combat the exponential growth of garbage (Stromberg, Joseph).\n\nAll that trash will not only be unsightly, but also harmful to humans, animals, and plants. Plastics and other materials are ingested by animals, and the chemicals these materials contain can easily get inside our bodies, and affect our hormones and overall health. In addition, the spread of garbage hinders plant growth (“How Our Trash Affects the Whole Planet”).\n\nWaste management is more pertinent than ever. By 2050, the exponential production of trash will result in a 70% increase of waste. Furthermore, by 2100, the world will be so covered in trash, that it will be a common sight wherever we go. Governments and organizations have to curtail this increase, or else Earth will be swallowed by human garbage, and disease, death, and a lack of living space will come as if a nightmare.###"}
{"prompt":"What caused the growth of Christianity and how did the history of this religion unfold?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Christianity is the most popular religion in the world, but it started from a humble beginning. With a Jewish man named Jesus of Nazareth at its head, Christianity was at first a small collection of Jewish people looking for blessings and knowledge from their savior. Eventually, at its present state, there are around 20 major denominations of Christianity, and perhaps thousands of sects of this religion. What caused this growth and how did the history of this religion unfold? The answers to these questions will be elaborated on in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe start of Christianity naturally begins with the Jewish Christians. At this time, it was a movement of people following Jesus of Nazareth, and not referred to as Christianity. These people accepted Jesus as the Jewish messiah. The only difference between these individuals and regular Jewish people was this acceptance. Jesus was in fact one of many Jewish messiahs of the time, and was not even the most well-known among them. He was mostly understood at first as a torchbearer for John the Baptist. When John the Baptist died, many of his followers joined Jesus’ group. Once again, it is important to note that all of this was from a Jewish perspective and within Jewish culture alone (Freedman, David Noel, et al).\n\nFurthermore, the beginning of Christianity can be said to be divided into two eras: the apostolic period and the post-apostolic period. There were 12 main apostles of Jesus and perhaps hundreds of followers at the time of his death and resurrection. Apostles were said to be responsible for spreading Jesus’ teachings and were to act in Jesus’ place, whereas followers were not given this right. However, when Jesus resurrected, he gave his Great Commission, and commanded all of his followers to have his teachings spread across the world and to baptize everyone (New Testament).\n\nThough Jesus’ last message was positive and all-encompassing, it caused confusion in his congregation when converting people of non-Jewish origin. In the earliest accounts of conversion among the Gentiles, it was not certain if they should be Jewish converts or labeled strictly as followers of Jesus. The issues of circumcision and dietary laws common to Jewish people were sometimes waived when Gentiles were converted.\n\nAround 50 AD, there was a Council of Jerusalem—about 15 to 25 years after Jesus’ crucifixion. The gathering was held to decide if non-Jewish converts to the following had to be circumcised in order to be “saved” (“JewishEncyclopedia.com”). However, other issues eventually got discussed, such as the need for converts to follow the Torah and Jewish dietary habits. What was finally agreed upon is that this Jesus’ following should not be difficult to enter, and that circumcision and other factors of Jewish faith were not to be strictly implicated. At this time, there were already several congregations of Jesus’ followers.\n\nAs the influence of the apostles spread, Jewish authorities began to retaliate. Many apostles and followers of Jesus started to be not welcome in synagogues. But in Hellenistic Greece, the divide between the followers of Jesus and regular Jewish people was not so apparent. In fact, followers of Jesus worshiped in synagogues for centuries after Jesus’ crucifixion (Nicklas, Tobias).\n\nThe term “Christian” came from a city in Greece named Antioch—now in the country of Turkey. It is where Peter resided as the first bishop of Christianity, founding a church there. The locals of the region began to call the followers of the church “Christians” to mean something like “little Christs” (Vonier, Anscar). From this founding of the church and them being called “Christians” the divide between Judaists and the followers of Jesus became more prominent.\n\nStarting as a strictly Jewish movement based on the messiah Jesus of Nazareth, after the death of its leader, it gradually transformed into its own religion separate from Judaism. Through the conversion of non-Jewish people and the building of the first Christian churches, the religion began to be more and more distinct from its Torah-based belief and culture.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the different types of teachers?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When we say the word “teacher,” it can mean many different positions depending on the level and institution this professional works at. In terms of certification, and not philosophy or any abstract thinking, there are preschool, elementary, middle school, high school, private school, continuing education, special education, and college teachers. All of these different types infer varying responsibilities and requirements to be employed.\n\nAs most know, preschool teachers focus on teaching very young children. This level of instruction is the first formal classrooms children visit. According to the website Teacher Certification, “Preschool teachers can work for school districts, but they can also run private organizations. As a preschool teacher, you’ll have a basic lesson plan that covers early learning. To be a preschool teacher, you should have a focus on early childhood education” (Types of Teachers). As you can see, being a preschool teacher is a flexible profession.\n\nThe next type of teacher in terms of grade level is an elementary school teacher. Elementary schools feature a wide range of grades, which is usually first to fifth grade. This means teachers in these institutions need to be comfortable instructing at many levels. According to Teach.com, “Elementary school teachers usually have one class and they teach their students several different subjects. The curriculum is usually structured around the fundamental subjects of mathematics, science, social studies, language arts, music, art and reading. The exact structure and pedagogy can vary from school to school, but for the most part, elementary school focuses on building the foundation for a well-rounded education overseen by teachers who follow students closely through their development” (“Elementary School Teacher”). So, in this sense, elementary school teachers aim at giving students a comprehensive education and vie for their academic development at each stage.\n\nNaturally, the next grade level after elementary school is middle school. Teachers who teach at this standard focus on subjects and courses designed for the sixth through the eighth grade. According to Teacher.org, “Middle school teachers are often required to teach 4 to 7 classes daily with students at different levels of learning abilities. Some classes may contain special needs students, but all classes are typically at the same grade level. Though most middle school teachers teach only one subject area, some may choose to teach an extra elective class, monitor a club, or coach a sports team” (“Middle School Teacher”). Middle school students are notoriously difficult to deal with, but that is why these teachers are especially needed.\n\nHigh school teachers are certified to work in high schools, where they develop students’ studies in middle school and gear them towards entering a college or university. As Teacher.org states, “Usually, high school teachers are responsible for teaching a single subject, like English or Math. Lessons are typically taught through classroom discussions, lectures, and other methods. Teachers tend to evaluate student progress through coursework, projects, and examinations” (“High School Teacher”). In addition, high school teachers are able to instruct in a way that is memorable and creative.\n\nPrivate school teachers, on the other hand, do not need certification in order to teach in an educational institution. Most schools require background checks, an advanced degree in an appropriate field, and teaching experience. However, these teachers are rather flexible in terms of curriculum, teaching style, and certification.\n\nAlso more flexible are continuing education teachers. According to TeacherCertifcationDegress.com, “Teachers in adult and continuing education work in a variety of educational settings instructing adult students in a diverse assortment of courses such as art, music, math, language, technology, cooking, and health. These educators work with students seeking self-enrichment and recreation or those seeking academic or vocational instruction for career advancement” (“How to Become an Adult and Continuing Education Teacher: Career and Salary”). So, continuing education does not strive to achieve degrees, but rather a sharpening of one’s vocational skills.\n\nSpecial education teachers focus on those who are disabled or impaired in some way educationally. Special education requires a specific certification, and focuses on improving upon a wide range of educational disabilities. These teachers can teach at any grade level, but commonly these instructors are needed the most in elementary schools and high schools.\n\nLastly, college teachers require a variety of certifications. If you want to teach in a community college, you may need only a master’s degree and ample experience in your chosen field. However, if you want to teach in a four-year college or university, you commonly need a PhD in your specialization. As we know, these teachers instruct in the largest variety of subjects of all the types of teachers.\n\nThis was a breakdown of the different types of official teachers. Each one requires its own certification and requirements. However, the common bond between of all of them is that they strive to achieve excellence in students’ studies.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the ways that tobacco is used in Native American culture?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" “Huron Indian myth has it that in ancient times, when the land was barren and the people were starving, the Great Spirit sent forth a woman to save humanity. As she traveled over the world, everywhere her right hand touched the soil, there grew potatoes. And everywhere her left hand touched the soil, there grew corn. And when the world was rich and fertile, she sat down and rested. When she arose, there grew tobacco . . .”\n(Borio, Gene)\n\nTobacco is used globally as a stimulant drug by countless people. However, it was not always this way. Native Americans have used tobacco in various practices for eons. In their culture, it was never associated with being an addictive substance. Rather, tobacco was employed in religious ceremonies, as a gift, invitations, peace treaties, and bargains.\n\nNative Americans comprise many cultures and tribes; however, the religious ceremonies connected to tobacco are usually common among the native nations. According to the website Indian Country Wisconsin, “…tobacco is the unifying thread of communication between humans and the spiritual powers. The manidog (spirits) are said to be extremely fond of tobacco and that the only way they could get it was from the Indians, either by smoke from a pipe or by offerings of dry tobacco. According to tradition, the Indians received tobacco as a gift from Wenebojo who had taken it from a mountain giant and then given the seed to his brothers” (“Ceremonial Use of Tobacco”). These types of offerings showed in various activities. For instance, “Dry tobacco was placed at the base of a tree or shrub from which medicine was gathered, and a pinch was thrown in the water before each day of wild rice gathering to assure calm weather and a bountiful harvest. Before setting out in a canoe, a safe return was assured by offering tobacco on the water. On journeys or hunts, Indian men paused for a smoke and left a pinch of tobacco as an offering when they encountered certain features of the landscape, including waterfalls, misshapen trees, oddly shaped rocks, and lakes or islands said to harbor spirits” (“Ceremonial Use of Tobacco”). These religious uses, and many more, were common (and still are) in Native American culture.\n\nTobacco was often employed as a gift as well. For example, shamans often accepted tobacco when a client wanted see to him or her. Also, “Requests to elders to relate oral traditions or other special knowledge were accompanied with a gift of tobacco” (“Ceremonial Use of Tobacco”). And in more of a general sense, “A gift of traditional tobacco is a sign of respect and may be offered when asking for help, guidance, or protection” (“Traditional Tobacco”).\n\nGifts and invitations sometimes go hand in hand. In fact, “The universal method of inviting people to feasts or notifying them of ceremonies was the delivery of a small amount of dry tobacco by a runner sent out for that purpose” (“Ceremonial Use of Tobacco”). So, instead of a card, Native Americans saw the tobacco plant as fit for this purpose.\n\nThe famous “peace pipe” is known worldwide. According to Museon, “The white colonists were mainly aware of the role of the pipe in sealing peace agreements. So the pipe became known to us as the ‘peace pipe’. To ‘offer the peace pipe’ to somebody means to try to patch up a quarrel. To ‘smoke the peace pipe’ with somebody means to make up after a fight and establish peace again” (“Smoking the Peace Pipe”). Basically, tobacco was and still is a tool for diplomatic relations in Native American culture.\n\nLastly, tobacco has common use in bargaining. In order to seal business agreements, a pipe filled with tobacco was passed around between participants. These agreements were normally between leaders of tribes (“Ceremonial Use of Tobacco”).\n\nThe tobacco industry is giant and the plant is usually perceived as a stimulant drug. However, in ancient times and still today, Native Americans saw tobacco as a sacred gift from the gods for religious ceremonies, giving gifts, sending invitations, initiating peace treaties, and reaching agreements.###"}
{"prompt":"How did Instagram become so popular?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Instagram has quickly rose to fame as a social network. It attracts all different types of users, but it especially is popular with teenagers and those below 40 years old. As young people migrate away from Facebook, they are gathering mostly on Instagram and more picture-based platforms. In order to fully understand the importance of this application, it would be useful to know its history and how it developed.\n\nIn San Francisco in 2010, Kevin Systrom (programmer) and Mike Krieger (software engineer) shifted their program Burbn to focus on mobile photography. Krieger thought their program had became akin to Foursquare and wanted to shy away from this similarity (Kevin Systrom). They then came up with an idea to name an application Instagram, which is a blend of the words “instant camera” and “telegram” (The New York Times).\n\nAfter getting $500,000 in funding from Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz in March of 2010 (Siegler, MG), they hired Josh Riedal as the Community Manager, Shane Sweeney as an engineer, and Jessica Zollman as a Community Evangelist (Shontell, Alyson). In the process of development, the first Instagram photograph was uploaded by Systrom on July 16th, 2010. The picture features a dog and Systrom’s girlfriend’s foot while in Mexico. As the first photograph uploaded, it showcased the X-PRO2 filter developed by the team (Trianni, Francesca).\n\nInstagram’s official release on the App Store as an iOS application was on October 6, 2010. The release proved to be successful, as by February 2011, the company had gathered 7 million dollars in funding from several investors (“Instagram Launches With The Hope Of Igniting Communication Through Images”). The investors valued Instagram at the time to be worth about 20 million dollars (Markowitz, Eric).\n\n2012 was another pivotal year for the company. Instagram was released on Android phones on April 3. In less than a day, the application was downloaded over million times through Android phones (Blagdon, Jeff). In May, the company raised $50 million from venture capitalists, with it being valued at $500 million (Tsotsis, Alexia). Facebook, seeing the application as a threat and viable competitor, bought Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock. However, even though Facebook formally bought the company, they allowed it to run independently (CNNMoney).\n\nAn engineer and software developer from San Francisco started the application in 2010, and they have not looked back. Instagram began as a Foursquare copy, but soon budded into a photo-sharing powerhouse. By focusing on the sharing of photographs rather than chat and other features, Instagram become more favored by the public and investors. The value of the company has continued to increase exponentially. Now a company under Facebook’s wing, it has acquired enormous funding and backing. The future of Instagram looks bright, as many Facebook followers have now shifted there in light of Facebook’s controversial trials and aging interface.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the eight main internal organs and what are their functions?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Human beings have eight main internal organs. These include the brain, lungs, liver, kidneys, bladder, heart, stomach, and intestines. Each one has different functions and some are more important than others. However, if one of these organs would be removed from a person, living would be difficult. Anyways, in the following paragraphs, the functions of each of these organs will be explained in detail.\n\nThe brain is perhaps our most essential organ that differentiates us from other animals. According to the Department of Education and Training Victoria, “The brain is the control centre of the nervous system and is located within the skull. Its functions include muscle control and coordination, sensory reception and integration, speech production, memory storage, and the elaboration of thought and emotion” (“Internal Body Organs”). So, without our brain, we could not move, think, or control our body in any shape or form.\n\nThough the brain seems essential, the lungs can be said to be equally important. Without a set of lungs, we would die within a minute or so. Stated by LiveScience, “The lungs are responsible for removing oxygen from the air we breathe and transferring it to our blood where it can be sent to our cells. The lungs also remove carbon dioxide, which we exhale” (Rettner, Rachel). Basically, the lungs are a filter for our breathing capabilities and for things that are harmful to us in the air.\n\nAnother filter for our body is the liver. However, this organ also functions as more than that. According to WebMD, “The liver’s main job is to filter the blood coming from the digestive tract, before passing it to the rest of the body. The liver also detoxifies chemicals and metabolizes drugs. As it does so, the liver secretes bile that ends up back in the intestines. The liver also makes proteins important for blood clotting and other functions” (Hoffman, Matthew). Without having a liver or it working well, we would get ill in a snap.\n\nA normal human being has two kidneys, and a person can live with just one. However, this does not lessen the importance of this organ. Based on information from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, “Your kidneys remove wastes and extra fluid from your body. Your kidneys also remove acid that is produced by the cells of your body and maintain a healthy balance of water, salts, and minerals—such as sodium, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium—in your blood” (“Your Kidneys & How They Work”). So, the kidneys are filters and a balancer that accompanies its cousin, the liver.\n\nNot as essential as other organs, the bladder gathers urine, which is created in the kidneys. Without the bladder sac—which is about the size of a pear without being filled—we would be peeing more frequently. The bladder allows us to urinate infrequently (“Picture of the Bladder”).\n\nBack to important organs, the heart, according to Medical News Today, “…beats 100,000 times a day, pushing 5,000 gallons of blood through our body every 24 hours. It delivers oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood to our tissues and carries away waste” (Newman, Tim). If our heart stops, we will die in a matter of minutes.\nNow we move onto the stomach. As we might know, its priority is to digest the food we consume. After being digested by being broken down, our food is turned into a liquid (“Internal Body Organs”).\n\nLastly, we have the intestines. There is a small intestine and a large intestine. The small one takes in ingested food, while the large one absorbs water and sends off waste (“Internal Body Organs”).\n\nWith these eight organs, our body functions properly. Take out one of them, and maybe we can survive with difficulty, such as a kidney. But the best thing we can do is to take care of our organs by eating the right food, seeing a doctor often, and not taking in any harmful substances.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the first records of human rights and what do they entail?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Human rights are usually said to be inalienable and innate. However, universal human rights are more of a modern invention. In the ancient past, these principles were more geared towards certain sections of society. Anyways, in the following paragraphs, there will be an exploration of the first records of human rights and what they entailed.\n\nThere are differing opinions of the first legal code and example of human rights. However, one can say that the oldest legal code known to humanity is The reforms of Urukagina of Lagash, created around 2350 BC in the area of Iraq. Though the record of it does not exist now, it is known that the reforms included punishments, especially for women. In addition, the document had laws against corruption. The volume is also referenced to, but has not been found (Yoffee, Norman). From the very beginning, human rights were not equal for each gender.\n\nThe oldest record of human rights that is in its original form is the Neo-Sumerian Code of Ur-Nammu, written around 2050 BC. It tells of punishments for offenses, which is either money needed to be paid, or something as severe as death. The document also described different statuses in society by law, and what each position entailed. Most of the laws are directed towards men, but women were allowed to remarry. However, if a woman committed adultery, she would be sentenced to death (Kramer, Samuel Noah).\n\nThe next pivotal find of ancient human rights can be said to be the Code of Hammurabi written around 1780 BC. Composed by the sixth Babylonian King, Hammurabi, it has 282 laws in total. It is reflective of previous legal codes in the area, and can be said to be a collection of rules gathered over time. In fact, it is quite modern in light of it including such provisions as the presumption of innocence, a minimum wage, the regulating of governments, and the striving of equal rights among all stratas of society. However, punishments varied widely depending on the interaction between classes. For example, if a rich man attacked a slave, the punishment would be less if a slave had attacked a rich man. Yet, the Code of Hammurabi was the perhaps the most nuanced code of its time (“8 Things You May Not Know About Hammurabi’s Code”).\n\nThe first declaration of human rights is believed by some scholars to be found in the Cyrus Cylinder composed of baked clay. Made in 6th century BC, it extols Persian King Cyrus as chosen by the god Marduk, and a restorer of peace. However, in some translations of the Cylinder, a declaration of human rights and independence is described (Robertson, A. H., and J. G. Merrills).\n\nAncient Greece envisioned the first rights of citizenship called the polis. With citizenhood, all people under its rule of law could speak and vote in a political assembly in a city-state. Each city-state was called a polis, and gave its citizens certain rights. Citizens generally had to be born within a certain polis and be free. Being assured rights under the rule of polis was a novel concept, as before only authoritarian rule determined if you were afforded human rights. The ancient Greeks believed themselves to be too progressive to promote this kind of rule, and vied for a holistic giving of citizenship (Study.com).\n\nThough universal human rights for both genders is more of a contemporary idea, varying degrees of human rights have been given since ancient times. Starting from The reforms of Urukagina of Lagash in Iraq in 2350 BC, documents were created to describe the punishment for crimes, the rules of business contracts, and the principles of family life. It was not until ancient Greece, though, that people born and free in a certain area were automatically claimed to be citizens and that their rights would be protected by a non-authoritarian government.###"}
{"prompt":"What was the first hospital developed?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hospitals have been an integral part of our lives. They serve as sanctuaries where we can heal and fix our physical problems. It is difficult to imagine a world without hospitals, but not too long ago, hospitals were not around. When and where was the first hospital developed? The answer to this question will be presented in the following paragraphs.\n\nHealers and wandering medics were common even before Christ. These people were essentially individuals who claimed to be able to cure diseases through holy powers, and often charged a fee for their work. But organized places to heal people began in ancient Egypt in temples, as religion and medicine were inextricably linked at that time. The first documented signs of hospital-like centers were around 3000 BC (“Mending Bodies, Saving Souls”). The temples were being used as sanctuaries for the sick, but they were not solely dedicated to this task.\n\nFurther on in time, in ancient Greece, around 12th century BC, temples for Asclepius acted as centers for medical treatment and diagnosis. Patients were instructed to go into a dream-like state in order to see Asclepius or to be healed through an operation (Diz José Carlos, et al.). This state has been compared to an early form of anesthesia. These temples were carefully controlled and maintained in order to be effective places for healing (“Mending Bodies, Saving Souls”). In fact, one of such temples kept exact records of around 70 patients, and among the writing is the mention of drugs being used, the type of ills the patients had, and what was done to cure certain ailments (Diz José Carlos, et al.). Subsequently, the Romans also worshipped Asclepius. A temple was built in 291 BC for him, and it also acted as a center for medical treatment (“Encyclopedia of Medical History”).\n\nAround 400 AD, a Chinese Buddhist monk named Fa Xian who travelled to India wrote that, “The heads of the Vaishya [merchant] families in them [all the kingdoms of north India] establish in the cities houses for dispensing charity and medicine. All the poor and destitute in the country, orphans, widowers, and childless men, maimed people and cripples, and all who are diseased, go to those houses, and are provided with every kind of help, and doctors examine their diseases. They get the food and medicines which their cases require, and are made to feel at ease; and when they are better, they go away of themselves” (Faxian, and James Legge). Records from Fa Xian and the Sanskrit encyclopedia named Carakasamhita indicate that India was possibly the first nation to adopt an institutionally organized system of medicine and medicinal care.\n\nHowever, it seems according to the Mahavasma—a record of Sinhalese royalty—that institutions specifically created for the care of the sick were created in Sri Lanka around the country (Aluvihare, Arjuna). It is said that Mihintale Hospital is the oldest structure of its kind (Historia Hospitalium). The reign of King Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka (437 BCE – 367 BCE) marked a new period of places solely dedicated to healing the sick, and it must have been an inspiration to other countries as well.\n\nHospitals have been around since ancient times, especially in Egypt and Greece. The creation of hospitals began as a religious practice, but later became secular through governmental organizations, such as the ones initiated in India and Sri Lanka. It seems that Sri Lanka was the first place where a structure was specifically built for the caring of sick individuals, devoid of other uses. Though the medicine and practices of those times were not modern, they did present the same organizational ideas that are present in today’s hospitals.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the cringiest moments in movies most people know?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Film has long become one of the most popular forms of entertainment. Be it action movies, comedy, horror movies, or dramas, well-made films always tell engaging stories. We all know and remember such epic and outstanding movies as The Lord of the Rings, Inception, The Matrix, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, all the series of the Harry Potter franchise, and so on. Many critics and viewers agree these movies are among the best in their genres, almost perfect masterpieces that set the quality standard for future generations of directors.\n\nContrarily, there are movies we remember due to them being bad up to the point of ridiculousness. The best example of this statement would probably be The Room filmed by Tommy Wiseau in 2003. Ross Morin, an assistant professor of film studies at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, called The Room “the Citizen Kane of bad movies” (Entertainment Weekly). The whole movie is a cringefest: starting with poor acting and ending up with poorly written dialog and awkward scenes, The Room is so bad that it managed to become a cult production. Almost every scene from it is worth being immortalized as an example of how movies should not be made. “You’re tearing me apart, Lisa!” This dramatic moment of the film has been making people laugh hysterically for almost 15 years.\n\nAnother example is Tough Guys Don’t Dance. Filmed in 1987, it is a decent criminal drama with comedy elements. The movie was not such a disaster as The Room, but it completely failed at the box office, and also included perhaps one of the worst scenes in cinematography. In it, Ryan O’Neal’s character is standing on a cliff edge, reading a letter; at some point what he reads shocks him, and he starts yelling, “Oh man, oh God” over and over again. O’Neal’s acting is so bad in this scene that the director Norman Mailer had to apologize for leaving it in the final version of the film.\n\nMany movies, however, fall somewhere in between the two extremes described above, being neither masterpieces, nor complete failures. Let us take a closer look at some of the worst and cringiest moments in movies most people know.\n\nTroll 2 is by no means a good film. Still, being far from such disasters as the aforementioned two, it can still boast of a ridiculously silly scene. In it, a teenager Arnold (played by Darren Ewing) realizes that he is going to be eaten alive by trolls; when it dawns at him, he yells, “Oh my Gooooooood!” for so long, with such energy, and with such a funny expression on his face, that it is impossible to keep from laughing. A fly sitting on Arnold’s forehead as he screams somehow makes the scene even more laughable. Actually, the scene is so bad it has become a popular meme among YouTube movie reviewers, who often use Ewing as an example of poor acting.\n\nAny cinema fan knows for sure that celebrities starring in a film do not automatically guarantee this film’s high quality. This statement is especially true for Gigli, a movie by Martin Brest starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. Overall, the film has only 6% on the Rotten Tomatoes website, but one scene from it is particularly bad (Rotten Tomatoes). When Lopez and Affleck are having an intimate rendezvous, she invites him to bed with the phrase, “It’s turkey time”–which is already ridiculous enough. When Affleck (and the viewers) does not get her suggestions, she only makes it worse by adding, “Gobble, gobble,” increasing the scale of awkwardness dramatically.\n\nAmerican Pie is an American comedy for teenagers, and because of this it should probably not be judged too strictly. Nevertheless, it contains one of the cringiest scenes in movie history: namely, when Jim has sex with an apple pie his mom cooked. As if this is not enough, Jim’s father returns home right when Jim is in the middle of the process, so to say. The two of them keep staring at each other for a moment long enough for you to wish it end. And to make it worse, in the next scene, we see Jim and his dad sitting on a couch looking at the destroyed pie, and then dad says, “Well, we’ll just tell your mother that we ate it all.” The forgiveness and understanding of this event is disturbing.\n\nStanley Kubrick’s Lolita filmed in 1962 is a masterpiece both because how well it was directed, and because of how powerful its literary source was. Despite the whole topic of the main character’s pedophilic love towards a teenage girl being already disturbing enough, the movie also contains one of the cringiest moments in the entire history of cinematography. In fact, it is uncomfortable to watch in a good sense: Kubrick masterfully pumps up the nerve strain. When Humbert finds a hotel to spend time with Lolita, he discovers it is already full of policemen. One of them named Clare Quilty, a pedophile himself, makes a note when he sees Lolita: “I wish I had a lovely daughter like that.” An innocent phrase said by a pedophile gains a completely different, sinister-sounding meaning, and makes you want to look away from the screen.\n\nEveryone has their own criteria of what is acceptable or not, and their own threshold of disgust and weirdness. What is just laughable and ridiculous for one person may be completely unacceptable for another. What makes you close your eyes in disgust or shame might be a slight discomfort for someone else. Considering this, it might be difficult to compile an ultimate list of the cringiest moments in film. Nevertheless, the aforementioned scenes are definitely uncomfortable to watch. Starting with the slight bewilderment caused by Ewing’s performance in Troll 2, the list gradually increases the scale of awkwardness up to disgust (American Pie) and repulsion (Lolita). And while the latter two were made this way intentionally, we can only guess whether the scenes from Troll 2 and Gigli had been overlooked, or filmed like that on purpose.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some positive effects of video games on the brain?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" People love to relax by playing video games, or even get competitive through these games. However, there are substantial positive effects on the brain as we indulge in these visual treats. For instance, video games positively affect our attention, visuospatial skills, prosocial behavior, and migraines in children if employed in specific ways.\n\nVideo games affecting our attention is not a new concept. However, the way in which it affects our attention is not discussed so much in depth. A study was done by the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in Chengdu on video games on focused attention in non-expert and expert video game players. According to Medical News Today, “After playing League of Legends for 1 hour, both groups demonstrated improved visual selective attention, even reporting similar scores in the post-game test. Not only that, but the researchers found that the brain activity of the non-experts increased after playing the game, to the extent that levels of brain activity between experts and non-experts were now comparable” (Railton, David). Thus, tests demonstrate that selective visual attention increases due to the playing of video games, but that effect might only be temporary.\n\nSince playing video games is a visual process, it is no wonder that this activity improves our visuospatial skills. Sometimes gamers have been tested in this respect. According to Parentingscience.com, “Researchers have tested experienced gamers–kids and young adults–on variety of cognitive tasks (e.g., Boot et al 2008; Green and Bavelier 2007; Dye et al 2009). Compared to non-gamers of the same age, the experienced gamers could: track objects moving at faster speeds, track more objects at once, filter out irrelevant visual information, switch more quickly from one task to the next, better detect changes in briefly-flashing visual arrays, [and] more accurately predict how 3-dimensional objects would appear when rotated” (“Beneficial Effects of Video Games: Do Players Develop Better Spatial Skills?”). How much this transfers to practical application in daily life is yet to be seen, but it is a step forward in noting the changes our brain makes while playing video games.\n\nWhat might be surprising for a seemingly anti-social activity is that video games can promote prosocial behavior. A recent study involving virtual reality and superpowers demonstrated that playing certain video games increased rates of wanting to help others in need. According to the researchers, “The results indicate that having the “superpower” of flight leads to greater helping behavior in the real world, regardless of how participants used that power. A possible mechanism for this result is that having the power of flight primed concepts and prototypes associated with superheroes (e.g., Superman). This research illustrates the potential of using experiences in virtual reality technology to increase prosocial behavior in the physical world” (Rosenberg, Robin S., et al.). Thus, if you play video games based on superheroes, you are more likely to be a good samaritan.\n\nMoving onto a more physical attribute of the brain, playing certain video games and consoles have been shown to alleviate migraines in children. In 2013, a research study called, “Effectiveness and safety of Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™ training in children with migraine without aura: a preliminary study” came to the conclusion that, “Our study reported the positive effects of the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™ system as a rehabilitative device for the visuomotor and balance skills impairments among children affected by MoA, even if further research and longer follow-up are needed” (Esposito, Maria, et al.). This experimental treatment has proven effective, and who knows what will come next in treatments from the usage of video games.\n\nVideo games are sometimes celebrated, and sometimes demonized.

{"prompt":"What are some of the earliest signs of religious practice among humans?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Strictly speaking, the first recorded conception of a god by humans began a long, long time ago. Whether we imagined these gods, or people people felt a connection to these supernatural beings, this is not so much of the question. Travelling through the history of human religious rituals is a fascinating journey, and it begins around 40,000 BC.\n\nThe earliest burial remains of homo sapiens is near Lake Mungo in Australia. Many people believe this recorded burial is a sign of religious practice, but the god in which the people worshiped at the time is not known, if any (Bowler, J. M). On the other hand, earlier hominids had been burying their dead. Stated on the website British Archaeology, “Some of the earliest evidence for the deliberate disposal of the dead was found in Pontnewydd Cave in Wales. According to Stephen Aldhouse-Green the fragmentary remains – teeth – of early Neanderthals suggest that at least five and possibly up to 15 bodies may have been deliberately placed in the dark recesses some 225,000 years ago” (Pettitt, Paul). This means that our ancestors have possibly been involved in religious activity since our earliest beginnings.\n\nThe next step in understanding religious practice among humans comes from the Lion-man of the Hohlenstein-Stadel. It is dated from 40,000 to 35,000 BC, and was discovered in Germany. It is the oldest-known zoomorphic figure, with the head of a lion and the body of a human (though the gender of the figure is not agreed upon). Different interpretations are made about the figure, but it being supernatural in form has given way to researchers suggesting it is perhaps the first known deity (Bailey, Martin). In fact, other such figures have been located in the area, and anthropologists believe that this figure was an important mythological creature for these early humans in what is now Germany.\n\nAs time went on, burial rites became more elaborate, and there were signs of religious or spiritual practices. Burials in the period between 27,000 BC and 23,000 BC had peculiar characteristics. According to British Archaeology Magazine, “All these burials incorporate the heavy use of red ochre, and include the bones of large herbivores such as aurochs, mammoth, bison or reindeer – totemic animals often depicted on cave walls in this period. The earliest of the group are the ‘Red Lady’ of Paviland (BA, October 2001) and three young adults buried together at Dolni Vestonice in the Czech Republic. A little later came the burial of a small child at Lagar Velho in Portugal, wearing a periwinkle shell, and a young adult male at Brno in the Czech Republic. His heavily weighted clothing, marionette or doll, and possible drumstick have led some scholars to see him as a shaman” (“When Burial Begins”). At this time, a “human revolution” began in culture and technological development, and it was evident in their burials. The usage of red ochre and other ornaments is commonly attributed to being seen as sacred relics.\n\nAround this same time, “Venus figurines” were being made and placed in graves. What is intriguing to note is that most remains of early humans are male, but during this period, they were commonly accompanied by female figurines. At this moment, we have no clues as to what these “Venus” sculptures were for exactly, but it has been cited as representing a goddess. However, other theories propose that women were not buried often in these early cultures, and only figurines were constructed to represent them. Whatever the case is, these “Venus” miniature sculptures provide archaeologists with another concept for early religious practice (Pettitt, Paul).\n\nSpiritual practices resembling a religion can be found throughout much of ancient history, though it can be said that Hinduism is the first recorded religion and oldest living one, with the Rig Veda written around 3,500 BC (“8 Oldest Religions in the World”). But around the same time in Sumer, written records began to appear about the god Marduk (Mark, Joshua J).\n\nIt is difficult to say what the first religion was, as we have signs of spiritual traditions from 225,000 BC. However, to say conclusively about the first recorded religion, it is either Hinduism or the Sumerian belief in the god Marduk. In time, a new story about the earliest religion might be written.###"}
{"prompt":"How does globalization affect economies, politics, cultures, and laws?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Globalization is an interaction between countries worldwide. The cause of this relationship is based on closer contact through the internet, quick communication through other forms communication, and speedy transportation. Though the world used to be more separated and distinct in its regions, now we see that a globalization has taken place worldwide. This phenomenon affects nations’ economies, politics, cultures, and laws.\n\nGlobalization affects the economies of countries, for their good and bad. Sometimes third-world countries can rise to first-world countries, or vice versa. According to the Global Policy Forum, “Advances in communication and transportation technology, combined with free-market ideology, have given goods, services, and capital unprecedented mobility. Northern countries want to open world markets to their goods and take advantage of abundant, cheap labor in the South, policies often supported by Southern elites. They use international financial institutions and regional trade agreements to compel poor countries to “integrate” by reducing tariffs, privatizing state enterprises, and relaxing environmental and labor standards” (Paul, James). However, this process does not come without its mishaps. Civil society, especially laborers, are often put into situations that are unfavorable or downright unethical.\n\nPolitics is commonly a nation-by-nation phenomenon. However, with the interactions caused by globalization, politics can intertwined between several nations simultaneously. Based on research by James Paul from the Global Policy Forum, “Under globalization, politics can take place above the state through political integration schemes such as the European Union and through intergovernmental organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization. Political activity can also transcend national borders through global movements and NGOs. Civil society organizations act globally by forming alliances with organizations in other countries, using global communications systems, and lobbying international organizations and other actors directly, instead of working through their national governments” (“Globalization of Politics”). This synthesis often has drawbacks, however. Sometimes a nation can feel stuck and dependent on more powerful countries on the world stage.\n\nLike economies and politics, culture is also highly affected by globalization. If one travels to “exotic” countries such as Thailand or Burma, surprisingly you will hear American singers on the national radio programs. As the Global Policy Forum states, “Technology has now created the possibility and even the likelihood of a global culture. The Internet, fax machines, satellites, and cable TV are sweeping away cultural boundaries. Global entertainment companies shape the perceptions and dreams of ordinary citizens, wherever they live” (“Globalization of Culture”). Commonly these perceptions are fed by western ideals and values. This has become a serious issue, as many native cultures of nations have been, if not disappearing, diluted.\n\nEven though laws were first introduced in what we know now as the Middle East and Egypt, these ancient civilizations have now adopted new, western laws into their constitutions. This practice is a direct result of globalization and its reach. Paul James from the Global Policy Forum explains that, “…globalization is changing the contours of law and creating new global legal institutions and norms. The International Criminal Court promises to bring to justice odious public offenders based on a worldwide criminal code, while inter-governmental cooperation increasingly brings to trial some of the most notorious international criminals. Business law is globalizing fastest of all, as nations agree to standard regulations, rules and legal practices” (“Globalization of Law”). There are also international agreements on bankruptcy, intellectual property, banking regulations and processes, and much more. The most substantial aspect of this type of globalization is that companies are merging overseas, and becoming mega companies that control huge portions of certain markets.\n\nGlobalization affects practically every country on Earth. It is natural to want to interact economically, politically, culturally, and through laws. This process can allow poor countries and first-world countries reap benefits alike. However, there are disadvantages to globalization as well, such as bad conditions for laborers, a loss of native identity, and governments feeling trapped and dependent on bilateral agreements.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some tips for writing persuasive copy?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Thinking is what people mostly do naturally and fluently. It would probably be strange if there was a special “thinking mode” that people could voluntarily enter or exit. Contrarily, thinking is the process that occurs in our minds on a constant basis, day by day, 24\/7. If not obstructed by some sort of mental illness, this process is directly connected to speech, so we can always express what is on our minds, and are able to maintain communication with other individuals.\n\nSince this process is so habitual, we often expect such fluency to extend to other spheres such as drawing, painting, and writing. Ideally, we should be able to convey exactly what we have in our thoughts on paper or another mediums. Rather often, people tend to underestimate the work of copywriters and editors, believing they could do it themselves if needed. In reality, however, this is not the case. Unlike talking–although persuasive and eloquent speaking is an art of its own–expressing one’s mind through words or images requires additional skills.\n\nMany people seem to hate writing for some reason. Perhaps, it is the unexpected intricacy of putting the words together in proper combinations. Or, it may be difficult to keep one’s eye on spelling, grammar, and writing style. Either way, even a personal letter to a friend or a family member may look like an ordeal to someone who is not into writing–not to mention serious business writing, copywriting, writing for commercials and advertising, and so on. In this essay, we are going to talk about the methods and techniques that can make copywriting easier and more efficient.\n\nFirst of all, regardless of what subject you are writing about, be specific. The Internet is full of articles and advertisements checkered with phrases such as, “We are the best in what we do, and hundreds of companies worldwide trust us,” or “Call us, and we will deliver you a product of superb quality.” The truth is that such phrases sound like they tell something about the product they describe, but in fact they do not. What is this “superb quality?” “Worldwide”–how many countries is that? Vague sentences making unsupported and unverifiable claims are the scourge of contemporary copywriting. Luckily, there is a way to beat it. Use numbers. People like numbers, people trust them. If you write about something incalculable, support ideas you come up with to links to outside resources: research, polls, interviews, and so on. “IT companies in 25 countries use our software solutions;” “233 companies in the United States use our software for effective task management”–this way of presenting information is much more credible. It allows verification, and it gives a person reading it a clearer view on what you are offering. So, you should remember to always be specific (Enchanting Market).\n\nSome principles are universal. You must have heard the expression, “Less is more.” It is mostly used in the context of minimalist graphic, industrial, or interior design solutions–but it can also be successfully used as a rule for copywriting. You must have ran into superfluous sheets of text, and long reads which scream that the only reason for them being that long was the author’s need to meet the word count requirement. There is nothing wrong about writing long texts if you can structure and format them properly. Generally, is there are no specific limitations. Set a rule for yourself: to express your thoughts as concisely and persuasively as possible. Selling something in just a couple of sentences may be difficult, but if you master the art of it, your effectiveness as a copywriter will skyrocket. Check out TV programs as an example–those short descriptions of TV programs you see when browsing channels. Due to industry regulations, they must be only 190 characters long (Splash Copywriters). And still, reading such a brief description may be enough to make you interested in watching a show or programme. Or, take Twitter. It has been a surprisingly effective marketing tool for a long time, despite its format being limited to just 240 symbols. In other words, brevity forces you to focus your message, making it capable of surviving in the ocean of information surrounding customers every day, and penetrating the consumerist armor they wear.\n\nAny text should have a structure to make it more comprehensible, but in copywriting, structure also serves the need of selling a product to a customer. Knowing the target audience you are writing for, you should be aware of the “buyer’s journey:” the decision-making process a potential customer goes through before purchasing a certain product. Ideally, you should be there for every step of the process to help dispel doubts, provide information, and subtly push a person towards becoming your client. A typical “buyer’s journey” in its simplified version looks like this:\n\n– a person realizes they have a problem\n– a person formulates the problem clearly, and starts looking for the means of its solution\n– a person makes a final decision in favor of this or that solution (HubSpot)\n\nIf your text leads a customer through all the three stages, the ideal result should be him or her deciding to purchase your product as a means of solving their problem.\n\nIt is important, however, to not overpromise. Honesty should be your policy number one. It is a common practice among marketers to “create” problems for their audiences, and then “solve” them. Needless to say, such problems are designed specifically for a product that needs to be sold. A good example of such an approach would be all kinds of TV markets, where the arguments in favor of purchasing a good product are sometimes ridiculous and forced out. It is also common that marketers advertise a certain product excessively, making it look invaluable and unique. You should remember that if you want not just any customer, but a satisfied returning customer, you should be honest with them. Tell more truth than a customer would expect from you. Be your customer’s equal companion on their buyer’s journey, and they will trust you and your products more, even if they can see its flaws compared to other ones.\n\nOften, companies advertising a certain product use testimonials as a way to earn additional credibility in the eyes of their customers. It is well-known that people ground their buyer decisions on the experience of others; this is why testimonials from real customers are so valued. However, sometimes companies delete negative feedback, leaving only positive comments. Or, they want a copywriter to write only cheerful or cheesy testimonials, believing it will help them win their customers’ trust. This is the wrong approach. On the contrary, cut excessively positive stuff. Just as the previous piece of advice suggests, be honest. Your clients are reasonable, smart adults, and they know for sure that nothing comes without drawbacks and flaws–respectively, there cannot be just positive testimonials and feedback. If they see only cheesy lovey-dovey comments on your product’s website, they will probably suspect something is wrong. Instead, give them a reason to trust you. Provide them with alternative opinions and experiences in the testimonials you write–but make it in such a way that they do not overshadow the positives. In other words, make your testimonials look like they have been left by real people, not by hired writers (Enchanting Marketing).\n\nCopywriting is a difficult profession. Unlike many people probably think, expressing one’s thoughts on paper is not easy. Writing a text is something anyone can do–but writing a smooth and convincing text that will influence people’s decision-making process is a different thing. Fortunately, there are several tips that can make your writing more persuasive and credible. Consider using specific numbers and accurate information in your texts; be honest; be brief; be there for your customer at every step of their “buyer’s journey”–these are just some tips that will help you become a better copywriter. Just remember there is always much more out there to learn.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the origin of the word 'okay'?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" “Okay” is a word we use often unconsciously to mean a variety of things. We employ it to say something is decent, to state a situation is normal, as an acknowledgement of hearing someone, and more. However, we might not consider the origins of this peculiar word. Where did it come from? This essay will answer this question and more.\n\nFirstly, it is important to note that there are several theories about the origin of “okay.” Indeed, many words are similar to it in various languages. According Oxford Dictionaries, “It does not seem at all likely, from the linguistic and historical evidence, that it comes from the Scots expression och aye, the Greek ola kala (‘it is good’), the Choctaw Indian oke or okeh (‘it is so’), the French aux Cayes (‘from Cayes’, a port in Haiti with a reputation for good rum) or au quai (‘to the quay’, as supposedly used by French-speaking dockers), or the initials of a railway freight agent called Obediah Kelly who is said to have written them on documents he had checked” (“What Is the Origin of the Word ‘OK?”’). Though these variants seem to connect to the word in question, the evidence does not lead to them. Instead, the origin of “okay” comes from a much more American starting point.\n\nAnd, it is hard to say if there is a more American city than Boston. This city was at the forefront of political, educational, and industrial movements in the America of the 1830s. According to Mental Floss, “On Saturday, March 23, 1839, the editor of the Boston Morning Post published a humorous article about a satirical organization called the “Anti-Bell Ringing Society ” in which he wrote:\n\nThe “Chairman of the Committee on Charity Lecture Bells,” is one of the deputation, and perhaps if he should return to Boston, via Providence, he of the Journal, and his train-band, would have his “contribution box,” et ceteras, o.k.—all correct—and cause the corks to fly, like sparks, upward.\n\nIt wasn’t as strange as it might seem for the author to coin OK as an abbreviation for “all correct.” There was a fashion then for playful abbreviations like i.s.b.d (it shall be done), r.t.b.s (remains to be seen), and s.p. (small potatoes). A twist on the trend was to base the abbreviations on alternate spellings or misspellings, so “no go” was k.g. (know go) and “all right” was o.w. (oll write)” (“What’s the Real Origin of ‘OK’?”). What is astounding is that this jokey abbreviation stayed throughout all these years, while other such abbreviations faded away. There are multiple reasons why this happened, however.\n\nAfter the first printing of “o.k.,” it was used several other times in newspapers across the country, and it became increasingly common to see it placed in articles. It became so normal in print that it was employed in the US presidential election of 1840 within the Democratic Party. According to Oxford Dictionaries, “Their candidate, President Martin Van Buren, was nicknamed ‘Old Kinderhook’ (after his birthplace in New York State), and his supporters formed the ‘OK Club’. This undoubtedly helped to popularize the term (though it did not get President Van Buren re-elected)” (“What Is the Origin of the Word ‘OK?”’). The word being used in such a fashion obviously placed the term on a national stage, and even an international one. This was the turning point for “okay” from being a joke in newspapers to becoming a nationwide phenomenon.\n\nWhat pushed the fame of “okay” further was that it began to be incorporated into technology. With the introduction of the telegraph in 1844, sending “ok” to people was easy, fast, and convenient for showing how someone was doing. Eventually, telegraphic messages were not complete without the usage of “ok” to confirm information (Vox).\n\nLooking back, “okay” has come a long way. It started as a jokey abbreviation in Boston in the 1830s that was printed in newspapers, and got picked up as a presidential slogan in 1840. It then crept into technology with the telegram, where it shined with its short form and encompassing meaning. Today, it may be considered a parasite word by many, but it seems its standing is okay.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of geothermal energy?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Geothermal energy comes from the heart of Earth. In this way, it is a natural, clean, and renewable resource. Since it has these properties, it is being employed around the world in major countries, and even underdeveloped nations. It is a resource that is often considered instead of gas, oil, coal, and other sources of energy. To learn more about this significant form of energy, the following paragraphs will explore its properties, its power sources, its production, and more.\n\nFor about 4.5 billion years, heat has been radiating from the center of Earth at 6437.4 km deep. The temperatures down there are close to being as hot as the sun’s surface, which equate to 5,500°C. At this moment, around 42 million megawatts are being conducted by Earth’s core. The best news about all this is that this energy is inexhaustible, as the only thing that can make this energy nonrenewable is to destroy planet Earth entirely (“Geothermal Basics”). In turn, we have countless geothermal reservoirs. According to the Geothermal Energy Association, “Rainwater and snowmelt feed underground thermal aquifers.  When hot water or steam is trapped in cracks and pores under a layer of impermeable rock, it forms a geothermal reservoir” (“Geothermal Basics”). However, these are natural ways of creating geothermal energy. Humankind has developed ways to extract geothermal energy artificially.\n\nVarious geothermal energy plants have been created to sustain a consistent flow of this power source. According to the Geothermal Energy Association, “After careful exploration and analysis, wells are drilled to bring geothermal energy to the surface, where it is converted into electricity” (“Geothermal Basics”). In addition, with “…a geothermal flash power plant, high pressure separates steam from water in a “steam separator” as the water rises and as pressure drops. The steam is delivered to the turbine, and the turbine then powers a generator. The liquid is reinjected into the reservoir” (“Geothermal Basics”). Another type of plant is based on dry steam, where “steam alone is produced directly from the geothermal reservoir and is used to run the turbines that power the generator” (“Geothermal Basics”). Binary plants are a bit more complicated, as they employ “an Organic Rankine Cycle system, which uses geothermal water to heat a second liquid that boils at a lower temperature than water, such as isobutane or pentafluoropropane. A heat exchanger separates the water from the working fluid while transferring the heat energy.  When the working fluid vaporizes, the force of the expanding vapor, like steam, turns the turbines that power the generators” (“Geothermal Basics”. And like most other geothermal plants, “The geothermal water is then reinjected in a closed loop, separating it from groundwater sources and lowering emission rates further” (“Geothermal Basics”).\n\nThese plants might seem far from our households, however they can be used directly in our homes. Based on information from the website Renewable Energy World, “A geothermal heat pump system consists of a heat pump, an air delivery system (ductwork), and a heat exchanger-a system of pipes buried in the shallow ground near the building. In the winter, the heat pump removes heat from the heat exchanger and pumps it into the indoor air delivery system. In the summer, the process is reversed, and the heat pump moves heat from the indoor air into the heat exchanger” (“Geothermal Energy”). Therefore, we do not have only industrial uses for geothermal energy, but also commonplace applications. For centuries and perhaps thousands of years, people have been employing makeshift and mechanized systems to tap into geothermal energy to heat their homes, cook food, bathe, and other activities.\n\nAs we can see, geothermal energy is a powerful tool in the hands of humans. It is a renewable energy that has been radiating for over 4 billion years from the center of Earth. To understand the magnitude at which the core of Earth is burning is difficult, though it is comparable to the temperature of the Sun’s surface. Anyways, though there are many natural forms of geothermal energy (hot springs, geysers, and such), people have found ways to extract power from geothermal energy through the use of various power plants. Besides companies garnering power from these plants, people can employ geothermal pumps close to their homes in order to gain heat and temperature regulation for myriad uses. Geothermal energy is a clean, natural, and dependable source of power we should consider taking advantage more in our current climate crisis.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the gender roles in Japan?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Gender roles in any country is complicated to explain. In Japan, however, it might be more complex than other nations. This is due to the amount of gender-fluid ideas that have coursed through its history. From even old times, Japan did not disdain homosexual behaviour, and even considered it normal as a phase in someone’s life. Also, the appearance of men and women can sometimes be difficult to discern, as many products and styles are shared by both men and women in Japan. Thus, in order to understand more about Japan’s gender roles, the following paragraphs will be dedicated to describing the way Japanese society, over time, perceived the roles of women and men.\n\nBefore the times of Confucian concepts being introduced in Japan, the country was fairly liberal about its gender roles. You could say the treatment of men and women were equal, and male sexuality was modern in terms of western standards. According to The Independent, “In premodern Japan, aristocrats often pursued male and female lovers; their sexual trysts were the stuff of classical literature. To them, the biological sex of their pursuits was often less important than the objective: transcendent beauty. And while many samurai and shoguns had a primary wife for the purposes of procreation and political alliances, they enjoyed numerous liaisons with younger male lovers” (Robertson, Jennifer). As you can see, romantic pursuits were rather fluid and free, especially among men. The same article continued on this topic, “It’s important to note that, until very recently, sexual acts in Japan were not linked to sexual identity. In other words, men who had sex with men and women who had sex with women did not consider themselves gay or lesbian. Sexual orientation was neither political nor politicised in Japan until recently, when a gay identity emerged in the context of HIV\/AIDS activism in the 1990s” (Robertson, Jennifer). Thus, Japan had a much different view on what was acceptable for men and women in terms of sexual relations. Homesexual acts were more associated with a phase of one’s life rather than an identity.\n\nAfter Confucian ideas took hold in Japan, a more hieratical society emerged that had men at the top, and more defined gender roles in consequence. As Japan Powered states, “Men were expected to be loyal to their lords; women were to be loyal to their family and husband. Interestingly, women could own and inherit property and family position in feudal Japan. They were expected to control the household budget and household decisions to allow men to serve their lord” (Rafael, et al). However, when World War II came around, gender roles shifted again. Japan Powered says that, “The war also sharply divided gender roles, much to the detriment of women.  Women’s patriotic duty was to have children. They were encouraged by propaganda to be married to the nation” (Rafael, et al). This notion went to great extremes, as women were sent into war zones as prostitutes to pleasure soldiers, as it was thought that men are not battle-ready if they are not having intercourse consistently. For the women that stayed home and who were not drafted, they were told to stay chaste. This is quite a degradation of the ease of gender roles in Japan’s past.\n\nAt present in Japan, the roles of women and men are becoming more and more blurred due to women increasingly working in offices. Men do not know if they need to keep the macho, tough guy attitude they are accustomed to having, or take a more androgynous perspective on gender roles. Most Japanese men, though, seem to be convinced that they need to work harder than women and act manly in order to keep a defined gender despite women working alongside them in equal positions or even higher positions (The Japan Times). In effect, the modern Japanese man feels emasculated and is in search of a new identity, or is clinging to a faded tradition.\n\nJapanese gender roles began as a fluid and open exploration of what it means to be a man or woman. Over time, though, through the introduction of Confucian ideas and World War II, Japanese society formed more solidified gender roles. These perspectives are now on the brink of collapsing under the weight of economic adaptation.###"}
{"prompt":"How did Islam originate, and what are its core beliefs?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Islam is the fastest growing religion, and the second largest religion in the world. It is a unique religion in that it incorporates a lot of Christian and Judaist values in a new way and with fresh concepts. It is also the newest major religion, and has courted a lot of controversy—like most other major religions. Though Islam is in the news every day for its connection with war and immigration, most non-Islamic people do not know much about how this religion was formed. To allow people to understand more about Islam, its origins and development will be delved into.\n\nThe story of Islam begins with its main prophet, Muhammad. He was born around 570 AD in Saudi Arabia, Mecca, into a powerful tribe called the Quraish. This tribe was known for its trading power along routes outside Mecca. So, Muhammad naturally picked up the job of being a merchant along these trade routes—supposedly protected by a multitude of gods. One of these business trips became a romantic one, as he met Khadija. She was a wealthy widow that traded with Muhammad, and later they decided to marry (The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History).\n\nAround the time Muhammad became forty years of age, it is said that he started to have visions and heard voices. According to The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, “Searching for clarity, he would sometimes meditate at Mount Hira, near Mecca. On one of these occasions, the Archangel Gabriel (Jibra’il in Arabic) appeared to him and instructed him to recite “in the name of [your] lord.” This was the first of many revelations that became the basis of the Qur’an, the holy book of Islam” (The Prophet Muhammad and the Origins of Islam). Why these revelations were especially important was that they discussed a monotheistic god rather than polytheism, which was popular in Saudi Arabia at the time.\n\nIt was not easy for Muhammad to accept these revelations, though. It is said that only with the encouragement of his wife that he accepted the concepts and responsibility given to him. In 613, Muhammad began to preach these principles and idea of a monotheistic God in Mecca (History.com). This was to the consternation of merchants, however. The merchants believed that the pagan gods guided their trading business, and that Muhammad was trying to take people away from their gods’ favor. Muhammad was looked down upon because of his preaching, but the influence of his uncle Abu Talib and his wife protected him from harm (The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History).\n\nHowever, by 622, his wife and uncle had died. Muhammad now had amassed a significant following, and was forced to emigrate with his group outside of Mecca due to ostracism. Muhammad chose Medina to be the followings’ sanctuary, and he continued to teach others about his almighty God and new religious practices that were accompanied by new revelations. At the same time, the merchants from Mecca continued to attack this community, and eventually battles started to be waged between these two factions. Eventually, Muhammad’s followers were victorious against the Quraish through a combination of lasting warfare and diplomacy, and returned to Mecca in control. This meant that all the idols of pagan gods were disposed of, and the idea of one all-powerful god prevailed (The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History).\n\nHaving gained control of Mecca, Muhammad continued to preach the principles of Islam, and to receive divine commandments. One of these revelations during this time is the most famous vision of Muhammad. According to The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, “One night, while the Prophet was sleeping, the Archangel Gabriel came and led him on a journey. Mounted on the heavenly steed Buraq, Muhammad traveled from the Ka’ba in Mecca to the “Farthest Mosque,” which Muslims believe to be the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. There he prayed with other prophets such as Moses, Abraham, and Jesus, and ascended to the skies, where he was led by Gabriel through Paradise and Hell, and finally came face to face with God” (The Prophet Muhammad and the Origins of Islam). From this vision, Muhammad gained new insight into what God wanted from him, and began to preach new concepts, such as praying five times a day. But, it was not soon after this vision that Muhammad died in 632. After the prophet’s death, Muslims created two factions based on who would be the rightful successor of Muhammad—but that is a story for another day.\n\nIslam began when a merchant named Muhammad heard voices and saw visions, supposedly from the angel Gabriel. He preached about a monotheistic god despite living in a polytheistic society, and was challenged and attacked. Eventually this led to physical and philosophical battles, which was eventually won by Muhammad and his followers. Muhammad died with a great number of followers, a vast control of the area around Saudi Arabia as a political figure, and a new pathway for future generations to live their lives.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the main qualities of a great leader?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Great leaders are often revered and even worshipped. However, what is the secret behind their admiration? Are there certain characteristics that distinguish a leader from another person? In most cases, good leaders want those under him or her to succeed, are visionaries, are inspiring, guide others towards an outcome, and are great at self-assessment. Though there are many other qualities of good leaders that can be mentioned, these are the main ones that contribute to their position.\n\nThough people who manage others are often self-serving, true leaders want those they work for to accomplish team goals. According to Meredith Moore Crosby from Leverette Weekes, “The jump from individual contributor to leader is a mindset shift to care about the broader organization outside of daily responsibilities. Leaders take on challenges instead of waiting for assignments. Leaders build organizations and help managers understand their function. Leaders study the organization and contribute beyond their role by developing managers” (Council, Forbes Coaches). Unlike managers, leaders are more holistic workers rather than micromanagers.\n\nLeaders, besides wanting their teams to succeed, are also visionaries. Alan Zimmerman, with a PhD in Communication, notes that, “Many people would argue that the best CEO (maybe not the best person) of the 20th century was Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric. When asked for his thoughts on leadership, he echoed the same sentiment. Leadership starts with vision” (“Leaders Are Visionaries”). Real leaders seek to challenge the norm and look for fresh ideas in their sphere of work. Through these visions, they inspire their subordinates.\n\nAnd speaking of inspiration, leaders are known to be profound inspirers. They can easily increase the morale of a group, and push those that are downtrodden towards a common goal. As leadership coach Kris McCrea Scrutchfield says, “A leader creates a path forward with people using curiosity to hear ideas from their perspective. They inspire themselves and others to be the best they can be while stretching beyond what’s comfortable. Being a leader begins from within, not outside ourselves” (Council, Forbes Coaches). Commonly, leaders begin by being self-inspiring. They know how to motivate themselves, and from this basis, they know how to motivate others.\n\nIn addition to motivation, leaders act as guides. Instead of being forceful with directions, leaders help others understand what they need to do complete certain tasks without being oppressive. They have the best in mind for their team, and want to bring out the best out of every individual. Another part of being a guide is that leaders are continuously examples of what to be within a company, an organization, or a team. This means that leaders need to be ethical, well-mannered, and diligent in order to impress upon his or her staff.\n\nDespite all the amazing qualities leaders possess, they cannot do without self-assessment. According to the University of Notre Dame, “Knowing your areas of weakness does not make you weak; on the contrary, it allows you to delegate to others who have those abilities, in order to achieve the common goal. Rather than clinging to the false belief that they can do it all, great leaders hire people who complement, rather than supplement, their skills. Working on your areas of weaknesses will improve your leadership ability – and recognizing them makes you more human” (“What Makes an Effective Leader”). The worst thing for a leader is to get egotistic about his or her position, and to believe he or she can do it all, or that being in a position is all that matters.\n\nLeaders come in all shapes and sizes, but there are several qualities that form what a great leader is. Commonly, competent leaders desire those under him or her to succeed, are visionary in their work and goals, are inspiring to the masses, guide others towards an end point, and are proficient in self-assessment. As mentioned before, there are many other characteristics that comprise great leaders. However, these are the main ones that appear in the majority of shining examples of leaders.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages of having a mobile phone?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Mobile phones have taken over our modern world. It seems almost every person in every major city has one. These small computer-like phones can access the internet, do countless tasks through applications, and of course make calls and send text messages. People sometimes speak of the disadvantages of having a mobile phone, but this essay will focus on the advantages of them. The major advantages to having a mobile phone is that it is easier to express oneself through communication and creativity, to access entertainment, to be safe, and to connect to the internet.\n\nCommunicating with loved ones, colleagues, friends, and more has never been simpler. According to Techspirited, “By allowing instant access to any desired destination across the globe, mobile phones have changed the landscape of communication. Not only globally, cell phones are important in day-to-day life” (“Advantages of Mobile Phones”). Besides the ease of communication, expressing oneself creatively has also never been so straightforward. As Wired says, “The smartphone, like the PC and the Internet before it, has turned into a unique outlet for our creative impulses, and it will affect our creative lives even more fundamentally” (Capps, Robert). With our applications, we can easily draw, take photographs, write, edit, paint, make videos, and more.\n\nBesides an ease of expression, the entertainment aspect of mobile phones is substantial. The website Outsource to India states that, “Entertainment and multimedia apps have many usages across industry verticals. These include video and audio players which play a variety of formats – such as remote control applications which play music tracks on your computer, apps that let you buy and sync music from the online stores and other devices, compose and record songs, personalized radio, digital TV, streaming of live scores and so on. Music and video apps are perhaps the most glaring example of the rise of multimedia in entertainment, and include notable examples such as Spotify, TuneIn Radio, Apple Music, Play Music, Groove Music, Pandora, etc.” (“Entertainment and Multimedia Apps for Mobile Phones – O2I”). Basically, the mobile phone has become a miniature laptop computer in terms of its entertainment capabilities.\n\nMobile phones are not only fantastic for increasing communication, creativity, and entertainment opportunities, but also for keeping us safe. According to Love to Know, mobile phones allow us to call for help, aid us in finding our cars, give us the opportunity to employ GPS to make sure we do not get lost, and gives us a hard weapon in hand (Tucker, Laura). The more applications you have, the greater chance you are safe. You might have a flashlight app, an emergency call app, find your home app, and much more. The key is to have these apps handy in case a difficult situation arises, instead of filing them away on your phone.\n\nFinally, mobile phones have a huge advantage over non-smartphones: the opportunity to use the internet. The internet allows you to search for information so quickly, that even competent people are often slower at recalling and coming up with the information you need. Even with an internet connection based on data, a Google search takes little time. You can search for the restaurant you want to go to, a word that you forgot, the location of the nearest police office for aid, and find any other pertinent information. With its help, we can be as smart and informed as we want to be at any given moment. It is hard to imagine, but we have all the data and information we will ever need on our mobile phone—that is a benefit that cannot be overlooked.\n\nAs it has been shown, mobile phones give us the benefit of communicating easily, engaging in creative work through simple applications, being able to be entertained wherever we go, to be safer, and to access the internet with the press of button. Who knows what more advantages the mobile phone will garner in the near future.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some examples of matriarchal societies?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Largely, we live in a patriarchal world: men make most of the big decisions in government, in the office, and the household. Whether this is to our detriment or benefit, or neither, is up for discussion. Since matriarchal societies are present as well, it is intriguing to delve into their ways of governance and how their cultures operate. Prominent matriarchal societies are the Mosuo, the Minangkabau, the Akan, the Bribri, the Garo, and the Nagovisi. In the following paragraphs, information about these societies will be disclosed in detail.\n\nBeginning with the Mosuo, they live in China near the Tibetan border. According to Mental Floss, “The Mosuo live with extended family in large households; at the head of each is a matriarch. Lineage is traced through the female side of the family, and property is passed down along the same matriline. Mosuo women typically handle business decisions and men handle politics” (“6 Modern Societies Where Women Rule”). In addition, children are raised in the mother’s household and take the mother’s name. Sometimes the father has only a small role in parenting.\n\nFrom China we travel to Indonesia, where the Minangkabau reside as the largest matriarchal society. As Wordlette says, “The traditional Minangkabau long houses, called rumah gadang, are owned by the women of the family who live there, passing from mother to daughter. Husbands are only tolerated in the house under certain conditions, and return to their sister’s house to sleep. When men return from their rantau travels, they are expected to contribute financially to the construction and maintenance of the house” (Hand, Rachel). Moreover, women are seen as the head of the family, and their most important traditions are women-centered.\n\nCruising over to Africa, we have the Akan people that live mostly in Ghana. According to Mental Floss, “The Akan social organization is fundamentally built around the matriclan, wherein one’s identity, inheritance, wealth, and politics are all determined. All matriclan founders are female, but men traditionally hold leadership positions within the society. These inherited roles, however, are passed down matrilineally—meaning through a man’s mothers and sisters (and their children)” (“6 Modern Societies Where Women Rule”). In their society, men make sure their wives and family are supported, as well their female relatives.\n\nGoing out of Africa and into South America, we have the Bribri people of Costa Rica. Based on research by Intercontinental Cry, “The Bribri’s matriarchal clan structure means that tribal lineage is passed down through the mother, and knowledge and tradition is passed down by the grandmother” (Parker, Courtney). In addition, the tribe believes that “Mother Earth” is sacred and that one should live in alignment with it. “No one model can perhaps ever speak for all women but the Bribri experience seems to truly embody and express the key concepts and constructs aligned with the more holistic, rising model of ecofeminism” (Parker, Courtney). It seems that the ancient world is informing contemporary feminists about how to be better in their lifestyle choices.\n\nAnother exemplary example of a matriarchal society comes in the form of the Garo from India. According to Mental Floss, “…the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Garos pass property and political succession from mother to daughter—typically, he youngest daughter inherits her mother’s property. Once married, [a]  husband lives in his wife’s house. Should it not work out, the union is dissolved without social stigma, as marriage is not a binding contract” (“6 Modern Societies Where Women Rule”).  So, not only do Garo women control property, but also marriages.\n\nLiving on the island of South Bougainville close to New Guinea and Australia, the Nagovisi have women at the heart of their agriculture and leadership. Nagovisi women partake in the majority of the farming, and men depend on them to give food to the community. The men of the community only help with heavy-duty tasks. In accordance with this, women have the right to transfer land and goods to their daughters. Usually, a man in this society goes to live with the wife, and marriage itself is not institutionalized. In terms of leadership, women often take the spotlight, as they commonly have more responsibilities than the men (“Matriarchies”).\n\nThough these six examples of matriarchal cultures are impressive, there are many more representatives of women ruling certain societies. The main point to comprehend from these examples is that this type of governance is not harmful, and has been sustained and fruitful for countless generations.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the effects of anger on the human body?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Expressed anger is not only damaging to your relationships, but also to your health. There are specific conditions that anger creates within the human body that negatively affects our well-being. These effects are usually said to be risks to your heart, higher risks of stroke, a weaker immune system, an increase in anxiety, being more prone to depression, weaker lungs, and a shorter lifespan.\n\nSometimes when we are angry, we can feel our heart pump harder. This is not coincidence.  According to Everyday Health, “Most physically damaging is anger’s effect on your cardiac health. “In the two hours after an angry outburst, the chance of having a heart attack doubles,” says Chris Aiken, MD, an instructor in clinical psychiatry at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine and director of the Mood Treatment Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina” (Strong, Debbie). It is amazing that just by getting angry, it can mean that a heart attack is imminent.\n\nBesides heart risks, prompting a stroke has also been linked to the expression of anger. Stated by the American Academy of Neurology, “Anger and other negative emotions may be triggers for ischemic stroke, according to a study published in the December 14 issue of Neurology, the scientific journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The study found that people who had strokes were more likely to have experienced anger or negative emotions in the two hours prior to the stroke than at the same time the day before the stroke” (AAN). Both strokes and heart attacks are serious physical ailments that can lead to death. So, in a sense, anger can be linked to someone’s passing.\n\nA surprising fact is that anger is also bad for our immune system. According to Everyday Health, “If you’re mad all the time, you just might find yourself feeling sick more often. In one study, Harvard University scientists found that in healthy people, simply recalling an angry experience from their past caused a six-hour dip in levels of the antibody immunoglobulin A, the cells’ first line of defense against infection” (Strong, Debbie). So, if you are getting sick often, you should check your level of anger throughout the day.\n\nNow onto a more a psychological condition: anger is connected to increased anxiety. In fact, according to PsychGuides.com, “Unresolved anger issues lead to anxiety, which can have long-term effects on your life. Immediate effects of anxiety might include dizziness, rapid breathing, nausea, muscle pain, muscle tension, headaches, and problems with concentration and memory. Such symptoms can make it difficult to perform routine tasks and can add to generalized anger about life” (“Signs and Symptoms of Anger-Related Issues – Causes and Effects”). Not only does anger make us feel bad, it can also produce higher levels of anxiety that is accompanied by many different symptoms.\n\nIn line with another psychological condition, anger can make you more prone to depression, Based on findings from Everyday Health, “Numerous studies have linked depression with aggression and angry outbursts, especially in men. “In depression, passive anger — where you ruminate about it but never take action — is common,” says Aiken. His No. 1 piece of advice for someone struggling with depression mixed with anger is to get busy and stop thinking so much” (Strong, Debbie). It seems passive anger among men is a main cause of depression.\n\nBack to the physical effects of anger, one’s lungs can get damaged or weaker due to this malady. Everyday Health states that, “A group of Harvard University scientists studied 670 men over eight years using a hostility scale scoring method to measure anger levels and assessed any changes in the men’s lung function. The men with the highest hostility ratings had significantly worse lung capacity, which increased their risk of respiratory problems. The researchers theorized that an uptick in stress hormones, which are associated with feelings of anger, creates inflammation in the airways” (Strong, Debbie). So, being inflamed from anger takes on a new meaning when associated with our lungs.\n\nAnd finally, anger affects how long we live. It has been shown that if we have repressed anger, or passive anger, we can effectively shorten our lifespan. Studies have shown that those who hold in their anger through many years have shorter lives (Strong, Debbie).\n\nAnger not only demonstrates its damage outwardly through the destruction of property and people, but also inwardly. This menace causes us to have heart issues, a greater risk of stroke, a poor immune system, a jump in anxiety, being more susceptible to depression, inflamed lungs, and even a shorter life. Next time you get angry, keep these details in your mind.###"}
{"prompt":"What are five poor study habits that lead students into trouble?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Studying is an art. Many students do not know how to do it properly though. It seems as if they are always behind schedule when it comes to handing in homework, or preparing for a test. If they knew how to increase the effectiveness of their studying habits, they would feel less stressed and more on top of their deadlines. In order to educate students on how to study well, the following paragraphs will discuss five poor study habits that lead students into trouble, and how to tackle these defects.\n\nProcrastination is perhaps the most dangerous habit students develop. They put off their assignments until it is almost impossible to do well on them. According to the University of the People, “There are many anti-procrastination strategies you can adopt, from better time management to being more organized, following to-do-lists, to asking someone to check up on your progress” (“5 Bad Study Habits To Drop And 4 Good Ones To Keep”). However, to not procrastinate is more of a personal choice. Inner motivation is more important than outer motivation.\n\nFollowing motivation, each person studies better in certain places. Libraries, cafes, studying rooms in schools, and more, are often referred to as conductive places to dive into your assignments. The University of the People states that, “Rule of thumb: If you fall asleep when you read in a place (say, the couch or your bed), this isn’t the best studying place for you. The same goes for a place with a lot of distractions, like the beach” (“5 Bad Study Habits To Drop And 4 Good Ones To Keep”). The best thing to do is to practice studying in various locales and see what works best for your brain. You will never know for sure where you study best until you try out many different locations.\n\nAlong the same lines with atmosphere, you should you know how to get rid of distractions when studying. There is nothing worse than something breaking your flow when you working on your assignments. According to Oxford Learning, “Study distractions can either be internal or external. Internal study distractions include physiological needs and emotional thoughts. External study distractions include technology and people” (“Homework & Study Distraction Tips From The Experts”). This means students need to have peace inside and out. When you study, you need to get into a certain mindframe and space that is conducive to studying.\n\nAs a backing for your studying, you should take neat notes. A lot of students mess around when taking down notes. But, the key is taking accurate, readable, and comprehensive notes in order to make your studying and completing assignments easier (Garcia, Lori). With great notes, you can recall information from class in a cinch and memorize data your brain needs to use for tests. Also, taking good notes during class keeps you focused on the learning process rather than on your friend’s jokes, for instance. Having a good attention during class can change your grade.\n\nYou may have fantastic notes, by maybe you are studying with the wrong people. You could be hanging out with friends that distract you, or who are not as serious as you are in studies. You should pick co-studiers who are about at the same grade level or higher in class. There is no need to be rude and say to someone, “your grade is a C, so I can’t study with you,” but do your best to choose wisely. It might even be wise to choose to study with someone you do not know personally, but is from your same class, or studies the same subject.\n\nGetting studying done is notoriously difficult for students. But if they remember to not procrastinate, find the best place to study, throw out distractions, take clear and comprehensive notes, and do their work with appropriate people, they can achieve the grades they desire.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the story of Donald Trump's life?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" You might know him as the 45th President of the United States of America, or a reality television star. Other people might refer to him as an idiot, narcissist, and nasty individual—these are all facets of his personality. But in order to avoid bias and political rants, we will explore the facts of his life. Though there may be a mystery clouding the activities at the White House, there are not many illusions about the kind of life Trump has led.\n\nHis childhood was practically painless. He was born on June 14, 1946 into a wealthy family, as the fourth child of prominent New York real estate developer Fred Trump, and housewife Mary Trump (BBC News). His grandparents on both sides of his family were immigrants—his father’s side came from Germany, and his relatives from his mother’s side came from Scotland (Kranish, Michael, and Marc Fisher). He was raised in Queens, New York, and attended the Kew-Forest School from kindergarten until the seventh grade. At the age of 13, he was sent to the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, as his parents wanted to polish his character  (Kranish, Michael, and Marc Fisher). After graduating from high school, Trump went to Fordham University in 1964, and two years after, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania (Blair, Gwenda). During his time at Wharton, he worked at his family business, and graduated on time in 1968 with a Bachelor’s of Science degree in economics (University of Pennsylvania).\n\nIn the same year, Trump started working full-time at the family company, E. Trump & Son. The company focused on owning middle-class rentals in New York City. Aiding his father for three years in revitalizing certain complexes, senior Trump became chairman, and junior Trump became the president of the company. When this change happened, Donald renamed the company “The Trump Organization” (Blair, Gwenda). The focus of the company on outer-boroughs of New York City came to a halt in 1978 when The Trump Organization purchased a 50-percent stake in the Commodore Hotel. By 1980, the hotel was reopened as the Grand Hyatt Hotel (Wooten, Sara McIntosh). Also, in 1980, Trump aimed high again by building a skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan by the name of “Trump Tower” (The New York Times). From this time, there seemed to be no looking back for his estate career: he made or acquired the Wollman Rink in Central Park (1980), the Mar-a-Lago estate (1985), the Plaza Hotel (1988), the Trump International Hotel and Tower (1994), Trump Building (1996), Trump Place (1997), the Trump World Tower (2001), and Trump Park Avenue (2004). In addition, The Trump organization owned and\/or built various golf courses, casinos, brands, sports teams, Miss Universe pageants, the Trump University, and the Donald J. Trump Foundation (Tigas, Mike, et al). Though, with all this success, Trump filed for bankruptcy six times (Fiorina, Carly), and got married three times (Avella, Joe). He now has five children, with three sons, and two daughters.\n\nDespite this roller coaster of success and failure, Trump’s name became synonymous with “billionaire” and “brash” through his hit television show “The Apprentice” that began to air in 2004. Trump was its host and judge for 14 seasons, and during this time period, Trump became a household name (The Washington Post). This growing success, by most accounts, made his run as a Republican presidential candidate in 2016 triumphant. Though the reality star and business tycoon was an unlikely choice for being the 45th president of the United States, the majority of political experts believe he won the election due to Hillary Clinton being an unfavorable opposing candidate, his 24\/7 media attention, and his personality seen as different from the usual politics (Zurcher, Anthony). Though he ran a wild, scandal-ridden, and unconventional campaign, he won the electoral vote for being president, and is already talking about reelection.\n\nDonald Trump might be the most talked about person in the world at that moment, despite his presidential win being almost two years ago. Born into a rich family, he was raised in a manner that would befit him as the next president of his father’s real estate company. After obtaining a bachelor’s degree, he quickly became engrossed in working full-time for his father company, and moved the focus of the organization to big buildings rather than middle-class rentals. From this decision, he has built a powerful brand that was only strengthened through his long stint as a reality television star. Through this significant image, he was catapulted into the political arena, and successfully ran as a presidential candidate, becoming the 45th President of the United States.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the seven types of love?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If you did not know already, there are several types of love. The usual flavor of love we see in films and other media products is romantic love, as it is seen as the most appealing. However, literature and psychology has identified seven types of love. These include sexual, friendly, family, universal, playful, practical, and self love. Let us explore these categories in detail in the following paragraphs.\n\nSexual love is most connected to what we think of as romantic. According to Psychology Today, this type of love is called “eros” in Greek mythology, and that, “it is a form of madness brought about by one of Cupid’s arrows. The arrow breaches us and we ‘fall’ in love, as did Paris with Helen, leading to the Trojan War and the downfall of Troy and much of the assembled Greek army. In modern times, eros has been amalgamated with the broader life force, something akin to Schopenhauer’s will, a fundamentally blind process of striving for survival and reproduction” (“These Are the 7 Types of Love”). Though most people do not connect infatuation with love, when one is in this state, it is difficult to say you are not in love.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, you have friendly love. This type of relationship is strictly platonic. With this type of love, we can say we experience what true friendship is. Psychology Today states that, “Real friends seek together to live truer, fuller lives by relating to each other authentically and teaching each other about the limitations of their beliefs and the defects in their character, which are a far greater source of error than mere rational confusion: they are, in effect, each other’s therapist—and in that much it helps to find a friend with some degree of openness, articulacy, and insight, both to change and to be changed” (“These Are the 7 Types of Love”). So, friendly love is often incurred through the grace of a connection between two people, and by that correspondance, two individuals transform each other’s lives.\n\nAnother platonic type of love is the familial variety. Family love among certain cultures is especially strong: Italian, Greek, Irish, and many more societies believe in the foundation of a strong family relationship above all else. According to Healthy Beginnings, “Unconditional love is defined as affection with no limits or conditions; complete love. Familial love and unconditional love seem to go hand in hand. Our mother or father might tell us that no matter how angry they are, they will always love us. Our brother or sister might push us around at home, but when someone else is doing the pushing, they’re always there to defend us” (“Familial Love”). Indeed, familial love is the foundation from which all other loves spring.\n\nA high-minded and spiritual type of love comparable to the purity of familial love is universal love. Psychology Today proposes that, “At a social level, altruism serves as a signal of cooperative intentions, and also of resource availability and so of mating or partnering potential. It also opens up a debt account, encouraging beneficiaries to reciprocate with gifts and favours that may be of much greater value to us than those with which we feel able to part. More generally, altruism, or agape, helps to build and maintain the psychological, social, and, indeed, environmental fabric that shields, sustains, and enriches us” (“These Are the 7 Types of Love”). In other words, universal love makes us a more complete and holistic human being.\n\nDown to a lower level, we have playful love, which constitutes having romantic flings. This type of uncommitted love is common among today’s users of Tinder, Grindr, and other applications that aid people in finding quick meetups to have sexual encounters. This is different than sexual love, however, as playful love does not engender infatuation.\n\nGoing higher again, practical love is related to long-term interests founded on one’s sense of duty. A love for achieving goals and working towards the betterment of two people define this type of feeling. Many political and celebrity relationships feature practical love, as they enjoy striving towards certain aspirations.\n\nThe last category is self-love. This can either manifest as pride or self-esteem, where the latter is more positive. Throughout times, hubris has been frowned upon, but having confidence in oneself has almost always been seen as a beneficial attribute.\n\nTo clear the board, we have many types of love in this world, despite what Hollywood and other media outlets tend to portray. There is sexual, friendly, family, universal, playful, practical, and self love, of which familial love and universal love are seen as the most honorable.###"}
{"prompt":"How does the brain work?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The brain, despite popular belief, is not like a computer. In fact, we cannot find out how to artificially create a thought through technology or replication (at least at this point). But even though we are not exactly clear on how the brain works, we do know about its parts and its functions. There are three main parts of the brain: the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brainstem. We will go over these three areas in detail in the following paragraphs, including the various lobes that accompany these sections of the brain.\n\nHitting it off, the cerebrum “is the largest part of the brain and is composed of right and left hemispheres. It performs higher functions like interpreting touch, vision and hearing, as well as speech, reasoning, emotions, learning, and fine control of movement” (Spinal Cord Stimulator). The two sides of the brain have varying functions, and both sides are joined by a bundle of fibers named corpus callosum. This part sends signals or messages from one side to the other. Though the left and right brain hemispheres of the brain are connected, they display different functions. According to the Mayfield Clinic, “In general, the left hemisphere controls speech, comprehension, arithmetic, and writing. The right hemisphere controls creativity, spatial ability, artistic, and musical skills. The left hemisphere is dominant in hand use and language in about 92% of people” (Spinal Cord Stimulator). This means that while some tasks are interconnected, a large part of the duties of the brain are divided into two sections with their separate responsibilities.\n\nGetting to the cerebellum, it is under the cerebrum, and its purpose is to provide muscle coordination, correct posture, and the right physical balance. Based on information from Health24, “New research has also linked it to thinking, novelty, and emotions. The limbic system, often referred to as the “emotional brain”, is found buried within the cerebrum” (“Brain Areas and Their Functions”). So, even though this part is smaller than the cerebrum, it is maybe what makes us the most human.\n\nThe brainstem looks trivial if you see it in a diagram, but this is far from the truth. Mayfield Clinic states that the brainstem, “acts as a relay center connecting the cerebrum and cerebellum to the spinal cord. It performs many automatic functions such as breathing, heart rate, body temperature, wake and sleep cycles, digestion, sneezing, coughing, vomiting, and swallowing” (Spinal Cord Stimulator). It is not a stretch to say that without the brainstem, much of what we do without thinking or conscious effort would be dismantled and we would not be able to live.\n\nNow that we have gone over the three major parts of the brain, let us discuss the lobes that are divided into four sections in each hemisphere of the brain. We got the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and the temporal lobe. According to Health24, the frontal lobe “is concerned with emotions, reasoning, planning, movement, and parts of speech. It is also involved in purposeful acts such as creativity, judgment, and problem solving, and planning” (“Brain Areas and Their Functions”). Turning to the parietal lobe, its focus is on interpreting language and words, processing the sense of touch, pain, and temperature, interpreting information from our sensory perceptions and memory, and finally spatial and visual perception. The occipital lobe is more simple, with one only function: interpreting vision, which comprises color, light, and movement. However, with the temporal lobe, we get into more serious country again. In fact, there are temporal lobes on both sides of the brain, and they “are responsible for hearing, memory, meaning, and language. They also play a role in emotion and learning. The temporal lobes are concerned with interpreting and processing auditory stimuli” (Health24). As you can see, each of the lobes have specific roles that intertwine and overlap in duties.\n\nThe brain is super complex. In fact, knowing how the brain works in its entirety has not been achieved. However, we do know what comprises the brain and these parts’ functions. With the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brainstem, and the four lobes that are integrated into these sections, we understand how the brain operates, but not exactly how consciousness and original thought is formed.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the healthiest foods to eat and what does a balanced diet look like?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" People trying to eat healthy food has become a global trend. They not only want to live longer but also desire to look and feel better. This is understandable, as consuming unhealthy food makes one experience life differently; some say eating junk food can make you feel like you have a junk life. In respect to this, we should investigate the healthiest foods to eat and what a balanced diet looks like.\n\nKnowing what items are the healthiest to eat will help you consider them in your daily meals. According to Fitness Magazine, lemons, broccoli, dark chocolate, potatoes, salmon, walnuts, avocados, garlic, spinach, and beans are the top 10 healthiest foods in the world (“The 10 Healthiest Foods on the Planet”).\n\nLet us examine why. “Just one lemon has more than 100 percent of your daily intake of vitamin C, which may help increase “good” HDL cholesterol levels and strengthen bones. Citrus flavonoids found in lemons may help inhibit the growth of cancer cells and act as an anti-inflammatory” (Fitness Magazine). In the case of broccoli, it keeps you away from cancer and gives you loads of vitamin K and C. For dark chocolate, “Just one-fourth of an ounce daily can reduce blood pressure in otherwise healthy individuals. Cocoa powder is rich in flavonoids, antioxidants shown to reduce “bad” LDL cholesterol and increase “good” HDL levels” (Fitness Magazine). Potatoes may not seem super healthy but they are a great source of cell-building folate, and sweet potatoes, in particular, can stave off cancer and provide with you a lot of vitamin A. The Native Americans stayed healthy with salmon, as it is “A great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been linked to a reduced risk of depression, heart disease, and cancer. A 3-ounce serving contains almost 50 percent of your daily dose of niacin, which may protect against Alzheimer’s disease and memory loss” (Fitness Magazine). Making its way next on the list is the walnut, which has the omega-3 fatty acids you need (the best out of all the nuts). Avocados are known to be healthy, but most people cannot say why. Well, they are “Rich in healthy, satisfying fats proven in one study to lower cholesterol by about 22 percent. One has more than half the fiber and 40 percent of the folate you need daily, which may reduce your risk of heart disease” (Fitness Magazine). Garlic is another miracle item that not only kills vampires, but also fights many diseases like E. coli, reduces inflammation, and lowers cholesterol and blood pressure levels. Spinach might be Popeye’s favorite thing to chow down on, but “Spinach contains lutein and zeaxanthin, two immune-boosting antioxidants important for eye health. Recent research found that among cancer-fighting fruits and veggies, spinach is one of the most effective” (Fitness Magazine). The last on the list, beans, are more than just meals to invoke stomach gas and to make cowboys feel better. Beans can lower the risk of heart disease and breast cancer.\n\nNow that we know the healthiest foods possible to eat, what comprises a proper diet? Well, most nutritionists point to the fact that we should have variety in our meals. This variety can be looked at through the food groups: vegetables and legumes\/beans, fruit, lean meats and poultry, grain, milk, and its products. As you might have noticed, cakes and donuts did not fit in these categories (well, I guess you say a cake is a type of grain, but not really). Food outside the five main groups are considered discretionary choices, and should only be consumed on occasion. Also, if you cannot fit all the food groups in your meals, you can eat them as snacks. Fruit and yogurt, for example, make for fine healthy snacks. The key is to have a balance of all the food groups throughout your day and to indulge outside of them no more than a few times a week (Better Health Channel).\n\nAs we have discovered, there are simple ways to maintain fine bodily shape through various, everyday foods that are healthy. Lemons, broccoli, dark chocolate, potatoes, salmon, walnuts, avocados, garlic, spinach, and beans are easy to find around but they are the healthiest food in existence. Besides knowing this, having a balanced diet according to the five main food groups will ensure you remain healthy. The most important thing to remember is to be consistent in your healthy eating.###"}
{"prompt":"How did table tennis become one of the most renowned sports in human history?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Table tennis, or ping pong, is a world-famous game. More than just tennis on a table, it is an essential racket sport of its own. Below, I will discuss its origins and how it became one of most renowned sports of human history.\n\nLike many other racket sports, table tennis began to take shape in England. In Victorian times, table tennis was a way for the upper-class to relax as a parlour game (Hodges, Larry). Most games and sports seem to derive from moments of fooling around or making fun activities. Victorian English people loved playing lawn tennis, and wanted to play indoor tennis on what they had around them.\n\nThis upper-class game was brought into the British military in India around the 1860s, and then brought back with new ideas. Piled up books on a table made a net, and a book in the hand became a paddle. The ball was usually a golf ball (A Comprehensive History of Table Tennis). As the game was played more and more in households, some people saw a business idea in it.\n\nFor instance, starting from 1901, “ping-pong” was trademarked and manufactured by British company J. Jaques & Son (Jaques London). The set was expensive and meant for the upper class. It had paddles, balls, and a net, but tables were not yet being made specifically for the game.\n\nThough the game was still being played on makeshift surfaces, when James W. Gibb, a table tennis enthusiast, visited America in 1901, he came upon a new idea for the ball. In the US, there were celluloid balls that seemed ideal for ping pong. Gibb gladly brought it back to his homeland to spread the world about a better ball. Also in 1901, E.C. Goode created the modern table tennis racket by planting rubber over a wooden blade. With these quick developments, tournaments started being played, volumes were being written about the game, and the first (unofficial) world championship of table tennis was in 1902 (A Comprehensive History of Table Tennis).\n\nTable tennis grew to greater heights of popularity with these competitions and better equipment. People began to treat the game more as a sport and something serious to play. By 1921, the first official organization for the game was created called the Table Tennis Association. However, in 1926, it changed its name to the English Table Tennis Association—probably to allow other countries to make their own associations (Itoh, M). In the same year, The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) was founded (Hodges, Larry).\n\nWith these organizations coming into existence, it seemed it was time to have an official world championship for the game. The city of London hosted the first official world champion of table tennis in 1926. There were single and team events, and surprisingly, Hungarians got gold in both categories.\n\nAfter the success of the first official world championship, the sport moved to the US. By 1933, the United States Table Tennis Association was initiated (Hodges, Larry). However, in the 1930s, the Chinese Communist forces in the Chinese Civil War enjoyed the game, though in the Soviet Union the playing of the game waned due to misinformation that table tennis was bad for health (Федерация Настольного Тенниса России).\n\nThe final development in the game that brought it into modern times was the creation of the underlying sponge layer below the rubber sheet of the paddle. This made the game faster and introduced many spinning techniques. Even “speed glue” was added to increase the velocity and spin that could be created from the paddle. Ultimately, with the game so adored and developed, it become an olympic sport in 1988 (Hodges, Larry).\n\nStarting from a casual game in upper-class homes of Victorian England, table tennis has become an olympic sport and a beloved game of millions. With the development of the racket over time, many spinning techniques, faster speed, and fresh strategies emerged. It looks like this once-parlour game is here to stay.###"}
{"prompt":"How has 3D printing technology been used in healthcare and medicine?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The story of 3D printing started in 1983 when Chuck Hall invented and constructed the first machine capable of printing three-dimensional objects. His first printed object was a small black cup made of plastic–but this crude item made a huge impact on what we now know as 3D printing.\n\nWe have all seen and\/or heard of printed objects. The most common example would probably be figures printed for desktop games such as Warhammer 40000, toy soldiers, small details, and so on. However, it is also possible to 3D print much more complicated things. For example, it is now possible to craft firearms and weapon parts (All3DP). There has also been news about habitable 3D printed houses (The Guardian). The latter might imply revolution in the construction industry, a collapse in housing prices, and the solution to the problem of cheap and affordable accommodation. These are just some of the examples of how rapidly 3D printing has developed since its emergence in early 1980s. However, one of the most amazing ways to apply this technology is to use it in healthcare and medicine.\n\nScientists are currently still exploring these ways. Nevertheless, there is already a plethora of examples proving the prospects and perspectives of using 3D-printed objects in order to save lives.\n\nOne of the most obvious ways to use this technology in medicine is to print equipment. Whereas in richer countries such as the United States or members of the European Union there might be no shortage in equipment, poorer regions may lack it severely. 3D printing looks like a perfect way to solve this problem. The amount of items possible to be printed is significant, and includes such titles as tube racks and plate holders for medical laboratories, microscope stands, joint protractors, vascular clamps, and so on (Thingiverse). For example, 3D printing technology has been successfully used to respond to the recent humanitarian crisis in Haiti by providing local non-governmental organizations and volunteers with the equipment necessary to deal with the aftermath, including medical equipment as well (3D Printing Industry).\n\nMoreover, some hospitals have already started to used 3D printers right on the spot in order to ensure that all the necessary equipment is always at hand when it is needed. According to Dr. Justin Ryan, a biomedical engineer and research scientist at Phoenix Children’s Hospital’s Cardiac 3D Print Lab, several years ago there were only a few hospitals in the United States that would establish 3D printing labs. However, nowadays it is becoming a trend, and the number of such hospitals is increasing (ASME).\n\nObviously, 3D printing is a great way to supply patients with prostheses of all kinds. For example, victims of accidents who had lost one or more limbs, amputees, soldiers, those in need of artificial hearts or other organs, burn victims–these, as well as many other categories of patients, can be helped now. For example, Jonathan Butcher from Cornell University printed a working model of a heart valve; in particular, he managed to recreate the muscle stiffness needed for proper blood circulation. University of Toronto researchers, in collaboration with Autodesk Research and CBM Canada, used 3D-printing technologies to supply patients in developing countries with cheap and fully-customized prostheses. The same was done in Sudan by the American “Not Impossible Labs” company specializing in 3D printing. Not just limb prostheses, but also those of tissues and bones can be created with the help of this amazing technology (3D Printing Industry). Even skin can be recreated now: in 2017, Spanish scientists from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Center for Energy, Environmental and Technological Research, and Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón presented the first working prototype of a 3D bioprinter capable of printing fully functional artificial skin (UC3M). These are just some of the examples, but they are already quite impressive. Undoubtedly, with the further development of this technology, there will be more and more complex organs and systems of the human body that can be recreated with the help of 3D printing.\n\nOverall, it can be said that 3D printing technology is incredibly prospective for usage in the field of medicine and healthcare. It can be used for not just printing medical equipment (although it is already a huge asset capable of solving or at least alleviating humanitarian crises, as well as problems with medical supplies in underdeveloped countries), but also for treating patients. In particular, 3D printing is a perfect and cheap way to supply those in need with artificial arms and legs. However, the power of technology already goes beyond printing limb prostheses: if needed, it can be used to recreate bones, organs, and even tissues such as skin. 3D printing technology is the future, and the healthcare industry can benefit greatly from using it.###"}
{"prompt":"How can virtual reality be used to improve people's lives?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Getting used to technologies that seemed fantastic about a decade ago is now something everyone has to do. Technological progress is so rapid that technologies become obsolete in a couple of years after they appear. One of the best examples of this thesis would be laser compact disks. Who now listens to music on CD players? VHS and cassettes are now returning as something vintage–like vinyl discs did–but CDs? It does not seem likely they will ever return.\n\nAnyway, as a piece of technology becomes outdated, another one appears on the market. Cloud computing and gaming, augmented reality, new generations of microprocessors and CMOS chips, folding gadgets–these are just some of the wonders of modernity. And perhaps the most astonishing one is virtual reality. Its idea has been around for a long time–perhaps starting from Philip K. Dick’s and William Gibson’s novels. But its practical realization had to wait until now.\n\nWhat is virtual reality in the first place?\n\nFollowing the etymology of the words comprising the term, virtual reality is something resembling the real world, but recreated with the help of artificial means. In a narrower sense, virtual reality is a three-dimensional simulation of a real world, generated with the help of computer programs. This simulation can be interacted with, and may include environments, objects, people, animals, physical phenomenons, and so on (WhatIs). The simplest example of virtual reality is any 360-degree photography from Google Earth or any other similar service. Each of them represents a sphere—the inner surface of which is covered with an image. A viewer is “inside” of the photo, which creates the illusion of being present within a certain environment.\n\nMore complex virtual reality simulations include programs for education, training, gaming, and whatever. In fact, the potential this technology possesses opens a number of wonderful possibilities to humanity. So far, it has mostly been seen as something entertaining: VR technology has been quickly adopted by video game developers, cinema, and even the pornography industry. However, it has many more applications, some of which may be surprising. Let us take a closer look at the beneficial and creative ways VR can be used.\n\nVirtual reality can save lives. This bold statement requires elaboration, and the best example that can be provided in this regard is emergency preparedness. When an emergency situation occurs–be it a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, a technogenic catastrophe, or whatever–few people know how to act in order to save themselves and those nearby. Despite all the drills, when an emergency breaks out, many people panic instead of acting constructively. How can virtual reality help?\n\nFirst of all, with its help, one can put employees in a situation of an almost real danger. During regular drills–for instance, when practicing an escape during a fire in a skyscraper–people know there is no real danger. They do what they are expected to do, use emergency exits, and then return back to their workplaces. However, if you ask employees to wear VR headgear emulating a real fire, you will be surprised by how different their behavior can become. For a brain, there is often no big difference between reality and imagination. A person will remember he or she is wearing a VR helmet, but his or her brain will be signalizing real danger. So, without putting their lives at risk, employees will be able to practice their survival skills in almost real stressful situations. They will have a chance to learn how to cope with tasks when under strong pressure and\/or stress, and even if they fail, virtual reality will make it easier for them to obtain new skills (eLearning Industry).\n\nSecondly, VR can be extremely helpful for all those working in the healthcare industry. It can be used for creating three-dimensional images of the human body, on which both students and experienced doctors will be able to practice complicated surgeries, diagnoses, and new methods of treatment. Virtual reality will also allow patients recovering from illnesses affecting neural system to regain their motor and cognitive skills faster (Live Science). Despite traditional therapy being effective, VR can make the process of recreation more fun and motivating due to the gamification and constant real-time feedback on users’ progress.\n\nVirtual reality can also be a great help for urban designers and architects in the matter of projecting cities and buildings. In real life, the problem often is that there is no way an architect can test his or her project. Building a test simulation would be pointless, and in addition would cost a lot. At the same time, mistakes during project development can endanger the lives of people who will be using the building later. The cases of the Husky Stadium in the United States, Hangzhou subway tunnel in China, and the Viale Giotto 120 building in Italy (as well as many other tragedies that occurred because of projecting mistakes) support this statement (Complex). Virtual reality, on the other hand, allows architects to no only design buildings and city infrastructure in the tiniest details, but also to create emulations of how their projects will “behave” in real life, or how they will fit into existing infrastructure and cityscape. In other words, virtual reality makes the process of designing urban environments easier, and contributes to their safety for citizens (Disruption Hub).\n\nAs it can be seen, virtual reality is not only about games and entertainment. Despite it being a new technology, it has already proved itself useful in different areas. In particular, it can be used to save people’s lives in emergency situations: by practicing survival skills in VR, people can better react to real-life dangers. Doctors and medical students can use VR to improve their skills, and patients recovering from neurological diseases may find it easier to progress with various VR applications aimed at helping them regain their cognitive and motor skills faster. Architects and urban designers can use VR to find potential mistakes in their calculations and projects, and test them in advance. Overall, VR will definitely continue developing, and the number of areas in which it can be applied will grow exponentially.###"}
{"prompt":"How do the six main stereotypes of men in the media affect boys and men in society?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Media analysts have long been studying the various assumptions and archetypes people create through the consumption of media. Though women are often talked about as having hurtful and detrimental stereotypes, there are also prominent stereotypes men portray in the media. In fact, there are six main stereotypes that have been identified for men: the joker, the jock, the strong silent type, the big shot, the action hero, and the buffon. We will delve into these concepts in the following paragraphs in detail.\n\nJoking around has always been a manly trait, it seems. According to Media Smarts, “The Joker is a very popular character with boys, perhaps because laughter is part of their own “mask of masculinity.” A potential negative consequence of this stereotype is the assumption that boys and men should not be serious or emotional. However, researchers have also argued that humorous roles can be used to expand definitions of masculinity” (“Common Stereotypes of Men in Media”). Fortunately, boys and men usually assume more than one stereotype than just the joker.\n\nOften seen as bullies or not so intelligent, the jock is a character that many high schoolers yearn to portray. As Media Smarts states, “The Jock is always willing to “compromise his own long-term health; he must fight other men when necessary; he must avoid being soft; and he must be aggressive.” By demonstrating his power and strength, the jock wins the approval of other men and the adoration of women” (“Common Stereotypes of Men in Media”). Often, this type of man is accompanied by insecurity due to problems at home or having previous bad experiences in social groups.\n\nSimilar to the jock, but not as expressive, is the strong and silent type. As Audrey Nelson, Ph.D., says, “Men often use silence to be in charge and collect their thoughts. They rely on it like they do the masked face. Silence exhibits control” (Psychology Today). Unfortunately, this stereotypical behavior commonly demonstrates to others that they are introverted or non- communicative, which can be a non-plus in the work environment.\n\nProbably the most obnoxious stereotype that men embody is the big shot. “The Big Shot is defined by his professional status. He is the “epitome of success, embodying the characteristics and acquiring the possessions that society deems valuable.” This stereotype suggests that a real man must be economically powerful and socially successful” (“Common Stereotypes of Men in Media”). However, this type of man usually comes off as being materialistic, self-absorbed, and ruthless.\n\nEpic in his own way, the action hero stereotype is carried out by countless men. “The Action Hero is “strong, but not necessarily silent. He is often angry. Above all, he is aggressive in the extreme and, increasingly over the past several decades, he engages in violent behavior”  (“Common Stereotypes of Men in Media”). You know this type: they are always fighting injustices or trying to save people from dire situations—even when it is not necessary.\n\nSimilar to the joker, but sillier and messier, the buffon is another common stereotype the media displays men as. “The Buffoon commonly appears as a bungling father figure in TV ads and sitcoms. Usually well-intentioned and light-hearted, these characters range from slightly inept to completely hopeless when it comes to parenting their children or dealing with domestic (or workplace) issues” (“Common Stereotypes of Men in Media”). Homer Simpson is a prime example of this archetype.\n\nThese six main stereotypes are shown in films, TV shows, commercials, physical advertisements, and literature. Commonly, men show a range of these categories during their day. It is almost impossible not to follow what the media has shown you since an early age. By absorbing loads of information from the media from most likely our infancy, we have created concepts in our minds about what men are supposed to be. Though stereotypes are hyperbolic, sadly many men believe in the factual basis of them. That is why is important to be aware of the stereotypes we have faith in and how we demonstrate behaviors associated with these categories.###"}
{"prompt":"How did football become the most popular game in the world?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Football, in its various forms, can be said to be an ancient game, and perhaps the most popular globally. Famous footballers are treated like gods in Europe, and the sport is actively played in the farthest reaches of countries worldwide. Though contemporary football began in England, ancient peoples played similar games throughout history. Let us delve into how this beloved sport, game, and pastime became what it is today.\n\nThe first time the modern game of football appeared with rules akin to today’s ones was during the Han dynasty and possibly the Qin dynasty in China (FIFA.com). This was in the second and third century BC, and the game was called Cuju. The Japanese also had their own version of the game named kemari and was developed in the Asuka period (538 to 710) (Japanese Sports: A History). These versions have been recognized by FIFA as the first occurrences of football being played according mostly to today’s rules.\n\nMany ball games similar to football and rugby were played in the times of Ancient Greece and Rome. According to FIFA.com, “The Greek ‘Episkyros’ – of which few concrete details survive – was much livelier, as was the Roman ‘Harpastum’. The latter was played out with a smaller ball by two teams on a rectangular field marked by boundary lines and a centre line. The objective was to get the ball over the opposition’s boundary lines and as players passed it between themselves, trickery was the order of the day. The game remained popular for 700-800 years, but, although the Romans took it to Britain with them, the use of feet was so small as to scarcely be of consequence” (FIFA.com). In addition, across the globe, football-like games were in ancient times. Eskimos in Greenland, Native Americans, Australian Aborigines, the Maori of New Zealand, and other peoples played games that resembled football (Voyages in Search of The North-West Passage). However, it was the Chinese with their game Cuju that was the true football link from the ancient world to modern times.\n\nAs we can see, games like rugby and football have been played throughout the ages across the world, but England was the first country to make a governing body for these types of games, supposedly.  According to FIFA.com, “The contemporary history of the world’s favorite game spans more than 100 years. It all began in 1863 in England, when rugby football and association football branched off on their different courses and the Football Association in England was formed – becoming the sport’s first governing body” (FIFA.com). This event stemmed from the fact that many school football teams and clubs were formed, and representatives from these organizations in England wanted a set code for their beloved game. Through several meetings of the Football Association, rules were added, cut, and changed. After six meetings, the Association published the “Laws of Football” in December of 1863—making it the first official rules of football written from a governing body of club and team representatives (Hacking – a history). Rugby, the brother of football, also found its place with its first official rules be published in 1871 by the Rugby Football Union based in London (RFU). However, as it is known, football became increasingly more popular than its brother, and even soon moved to North America. The North Americans had their own rules, and split the game into kicking and carrying games—the carrying game we know now as American football without much use of the feet except for running and an occasional kick at the end of a team’s turn of play (The Journey to Camp: The Origins of American Football to 1889).\n\nThough football is ancient as a game, it has not come that far from its Chinese relation, Cuju. Sports using a ball, and primarily employing one’s feet to play with it, have been around for eons and have been seen in various countries. Yet, it was in the 1800s of England that football got its first set of official rules from a governing body. Since then, football spread not only to North America, but to every corner of the world—making it the most popular game our history has seen.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the history of the Great Wall of China?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The Great Wall of China is a UNESCO heritage site, and stretches 13,171 miles. It is probably the first thing tourists think about when they visit China. People know it is huge and that it protected a kingdom, but many do not know the history behind it and the details of its construction. If you do not have the chance to visit China and read information about the site, then this essay will supplement some of this missed knowledge. In the following paragraphs, I will breakdown the history of the Great Wall and hopefully you will gain insight into this important country and its ancient times.\n\nBy 8th century BC, the Chinese were already building massive walls to fortify borders (Chiculture.net). In the Warring States period, the states of Qin, Wei, Zhao, Qi, Yan, and Zhongshan built walls to keep out attackers and to show where their borders were. These walls were commonly made out of earth, gravel, and wood (Newsmth.net).\n\nOut of the Warring States period emerged the victorious King Zheng of Qin, who had defeated his aggressors and vied to unify China. He was crowned the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty in 221 BC, and his initial order of business was to take down existing border walls in his empire that were meant to divide. After this was completed, he ordered that a new wall to be made along the empire’s northern edge, and to connect some walls so that the empire could be completely marked. However, he did not consider the walls to be a fixed construction: Zheng’s principle was to build and move forward with the empire. In this sense, the Qin Wall was more of a flexible and always changing fixture (Burbank, Jane; Cooper, Frederick).\n\nAs you can imagine, the Qin Wall was difficult to construct without modern equipment. They did their best to use local materials from mountains and the earth. Sadly, today, there are only a few sections of the original Wall that still stand today. The exact length is not known due to a lack of records, and up to a million lives were lost as workers did their best to build this landmark (Slavicek, Louise Chipley).\n\nIn the following periods of the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), the Sui dynasty (581–618 AD), and northern dynasties (420–589 AD), the Great Wall was fixed, rebuilt, and expanded upon. Once again, the cost of lives was great, but they saw it as essential in order to keep northern invaders out of the empire. However, in the Tang (618–907 AD) and Song (960–1279 AD) dynasties, not much was done to defend against attacks in the north, and further work on the Great Wall was not put much attention to. As a side note, the Liao (907-1125 AD), Jin (1115-1234 AD), and Yuan (1271–1368 AD) dynasties built walls north of the Great Wall in Inner Mongolia and Mongolia (Waldron, Arthur).\n\nIt was not until the Ming dynasty in the 14th century that the Great Wall truly flourished, though. When the Ming dynasty suffered a defeat by the Oirats at the Battle of Tumu, and the Ming could not push the Mongolian threat after many attacks, they decided to build a new part of the Great Wall in the north in the Ordos Desert (Karnow, Mooney et al.). The Ming also went for stronger construction materials, such as bricks and stone compared to mostly earth. In addition, there were about 25,000 watchtowers along this portion of the Wall in order to make sure the Mongols could not further their aggression in the empire (Szabó, József et al.). With some Mongolian attacks happening now and then, the Wall was continually being reinforced. Military general Qi Jiguang repaired and reinforced the north side of the Wall, and made an additional 1,200 watchtowers all the way from Shanhaiguan Pass to Changping (Great Wall of China).\n\nThough the Mongols were a major threat to the empire from its beginnings, in the Ming dynasty, the Manchu were also gaining ground. They are an ethnic minority of China, and they began to try to seize control of Ming power around 1600. With successive battles, the Manchu overcame the Great Wall in 1644 to conquer land with the help of Li Zicheng—a rebel leader against the Ming dynasty. But as the Manchus approached Beijing, the Ming dynasty made a truce with them, and both of the armies together easily dispatched Li Zicheng’s rebels. From this intense event, the Qing dynasty was formed (1636–1912 AD) and was the last imperial dynasty of China. With the power of the Manchu on their side and renewed unity, China’s borders soon went beyond the Great Wall and Mongolia was eventually annexed. When this occurred, the further construction of the Wall came to a halt (Elliott, Mark C.).\n\nThe Great Wall’s construction started as a unification project from the Qin dynasty and ended with the last imperial dynasty of China, and with Mongolia finally under control. Perhaps millions of lives were given to its foundation, construction, and maintenance. Hundreds of battles and several wars were waged around and within its borders. The Wall stretches not only through land, but also through the many dynasties of the ever-developing China.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some technologies that were originally invented for space travel but are now used in everyday life?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is commonplace to say that all that was science fiction several decades ago has become reality nowadays. However, people often underestimate the extent to which space technologies have infiltrated our daily lives. We often use appliances or gadgets without even suspecting that they were initially developed to be used in space, in conditions of long-term orbital missions, and so on. Next time you watch a SpaceX launch on television or the Internet, you might want to look around yourself: chances are there is a bunch of things around you that can be referred to as “space technologies.”\n\nSometimes it can be difficult to believe that a mundane and boring item is of space origins. Take the famous “Dustbuster” as an example: a cordless compact vacuum cleaner massively sold in late 1970s. It was originally constructed for NASA’s Apollo space program. More specifically, during the program, there was a need for a self-contained, portable drill for gathering Moon rock samples. The drill was designed in such a way that it could provide solid motor power, while consuming a minimal amount of energy. The shape of the drill was the result of computer program calculations for optimal form-factor. Later, the idea of this battery-powered device was used as a basis for constructing a series of domestic appliances, of which the most famous one is the “Dustbuster” (Interesting Engineering).\n\nNASA is connected not only to popular vacuum cleaners, but also to more sophisticated technologies we use daily. A computer mouse–something billions of people around the globe use–has appeared due to the bright minds working in the space agency. In particular, among the forefathers of the computer mouse were Bob Taylor and Doug Englebart. The former worked flight control systems and displays, as well as simulation technologies, and the latter was a researcher in the Stanford Research Institute. The joint effort of these two people led to a computer mouse being created in the 1960s. Back then, people mostly saw computers as powerful calculators capable of performing complicated arithmetic. They were bulky, they were inconvenient to use, and manipulating data on them was difficult. The “mouse project” started as a search for alternative ways of manipulating data gathered by NASA during space flights. After Englebart received funding for his project, the device he came up with–the mouse–quickly overcame its competing analogs (the most promising was the so-called light pen). Later, Englebart worked on other computer-related projects, among which was a network of computers the users of which could exchange and transfer information (NASA)—but that is a different story.\n\nTragedies in Japan and Nepal caused by enormous earthquakes showed how dangerous living in seismic areas can be. Not that it happened for the first time in history, but it definitely boosted the development of a number of technologies meant to protect people and buildings from such disasters. Currently, about 550 buildings and bridges around the world are using shock absorbers–constructions whose main goal is to mitigate earth tremors and shockwaves caused by them. In particular, such absorbers are used in Japan, Taiwan, and the United States. But where did the technology come from? Obviously, from space–or more specifically, from cosmodromes. When a spacecraft is being launched, it needs special suspenders that help it maintain vertical orientation. These suspenders must be capable of moving away quickly during a launch, otherwise they will interfere with the takeoff process and damage the spacecraft, or prevent it from flying. The problem is that suspenders are moved away with such force and velocity that they may overexert and collide with the spacecraft. In order to prevent that, shock absorbers similar to those used in buildings and bridges have been used. This technology has been around approximately since 1969, when humanity first launched a space vessel to the Moon, and has proved itself extremely useful multiple times (Marketplace). So, if you live in Tokyo, San Francisco, or any other seismically active place, chances are that you work or live in a building that utilizes shock absorbers.\n\nNext time you take out your cell phone intending to take a selfie, think of NASA engineers standing behind mobile cameras in your Android or iOS device. Indeed, such cameras are yet another technology first developed for the needs of space travel. It is not like NASA scientists looked for ways to take better pictures of themselves. However, they do need high quality images, and they want their cameras to be miniature but stable and reliable. The research conducted by NASA engineer Eric Fossum was aimed at that: miniaturizing cameras and making them capable of withstanding the harsh conditions of outer space. His contribution was namely reinventing and enhancing CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) matrix technology, creating active pixel sensors. These sensors, unlike previous generations of CMOS technology (the attempts to implement it had been made since 1960s, but none succeeded because of technological shortcomings), can produce high quality images, and thus have been adapted to cell phones and other portable devices (Interesting Engineering).\n\nThis list of technologies originally invented within the space industry is not complete. However, it illustrates the fact that even the most mundane and\/or habitual technologies are not as simple as they might appear.###"}
{"prompt":"How have attitudes towards homosexuality changed over time?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" As human beings, we need to categorize and sort all kinds of things out. Thinking and perceiving the world around us is an energy-consuming process for the brain. So, in order to simplify and speed up this task, it came up with a mechanism of stereotyping, creating schematic and generalized beliefs about other people, things, phenomena, etc. In this regard, there is nothing bad in stereotypes. Without it, we would possibly have to rediscover and get ourselves reacquainted with every person we communicate with. Problems begin when stereotyping gains emotional coloring, and becomes a basis for discrimination.\n\nPerhaps, throughout the course of history, there never were debates more significant than those regarding sexuality and sexual orientation–at least, in western civilization. Although in some cultures, such as Ancient Greece or Rome, homosexuality was common, heterosexual relationships remained a standard. Although today there is a popular opinion that homosexuality was widely tolerated in Ancient Greece, in fact there was controversy surrounding it as well. For example, Plato is known to have called homosexuality “utterly unholy, odious to the gods and ugliest of ugly things” (strangely, he was also the one to have said that same-sex love is much more blessed than a regular one–before he changed his mind). Ancient Greeks had special slaves called “pedagogues,” whose direct duties were to protect boys–and by boys Greeks meant males up to 18 years–from sexual harassment from other men (The Guardian).\n\nWhen Christianity became the dominant political and religious force in Europe, homosexuality became taboo. It was considered a sin, a perversion–so those caught practicing same-sex love could end up doing penance, or worse. Strangely, medieval society in general and the church in particular seemed to have tolerated female homosexuality better than the male one. If a woman was caught having sex with another woman, she would most likely be condemned to three years of penance–in contrast to 10 years for the same “sin” committed by a man (Medievalists). This is not to mention that in some cases men could be executed for expressing and\/or practicing homosexuality. Women, on the other side, had more chances to be accused of witchery, and end up burning in a pyre.\n\nEpochs changed, outlooks and paradigms shifted, but homosexuality still remained something not spoken about freely–especially in societies where religious doctrines were still strong. But in general, there was a tendency for a more mild and tolerate attitude towards homosexuals. In Victorian England, for example, gay men were treated rather liberally–if only you can call a lesser amount of criminal prosecutions for consensual homosexual sex a “tolerant attitude.” Indeed, compared to other times, Victorian England was more gay-friendly. The case of Oscar Wilde, published novels such as “Maurice” by E.M. Forster, and other examples show that homosexuality slowly began coming out of the closet, so to say (History Extra).###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages and disadvantages of online education?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Studying is obviously not a thing young people enjoy doing. It would be true to say that the majority of adolescents prefer more active ways of spending their time instead of listening to lectures, sitting in a library, writing countless essays and reports, and worrying about exams. At the same time, no one will possibly argue with the fact that education is extremely important in modern western society. A diploma is often a ticket to the world, a pass to adult life, and there does not seem to be a way around this.\n\nConsidering how important it is to study, it turns out that one should approach choosing their future area of studies with full responsibility. Chances are that what you study in your college or university will later become your profession. This is why educational systems of some countries such as the United States allows young people to take a “gap year”: a period of time between graduating from high school and entering a higher educational institution. This time can be used for anything a young person wants, but supposedly he or she will spend it earning money to pay for education, or trying to figure out which way of life seems most appealing.\n\nBut even if you made a mistake and realized that the field of studies you chose is not for you, you can always take a turn and walk another road. Anyone who wants to study has the full ability to do so, regardless of their age or previous educational background. There are different online schools specializing in teaching specific disciplines. Whether you want to change your profession, or you are disappointed in what you currently study and feel like trying something new, there is always an option for you. Let us take a closer look at online studying, and why it can be an attractive choice.\n\nThere are plenty of websites offering educational services. The most popular are probably Udemy and Coursera, but there are also others such as Khan Academy, Skillshare, and edX. Your choice will probably depend on the region you live in, because some of these services may or may not support your native language. Also, some of these services can offer significant discounts, which will most likely affect your choice as well.\n\nNot focusing on the differences between these online platforms, let us find the advantages they possess. When you choose to study online, you will most likely receive access to video materials–as it is the only way you can watch and listen to your instructor. Depending on the complexity of a course, it may be divided into modules that contain educational material, presented in a logical order. Some courses may be designed for novices, while others will focus on advanced learners, so you might want to pay attention to a course’s description before paying for it. You mostly study through watching educational videos and completing assignments given to you by the instructor in PDF documents or otherwise. These assignments can be checked either by your instructor, or by the community, but completing them is your responsibility fully–meaning that no one will control you. Upon finishing a course, you will receive a digital certificate confirming that you have successfully listened to a course of lectures on a certain discipline.\n\nObviously, one of the main advantages of such a method of education is that you can study at your own pace. Basically, all you need in order to master a new field of knowledge is your laptop with Internet access, and perhaps additional materials or software–depending on the discipline you are studying. You can watch videos whenever and wherever it is convenient for you, and do the assignments as you find it suitable. Udemy, Coursera, and other similar services often host highly skilled professionals, so you can be sure you are paying for real knowledge. You get a lifetime access to all the materials, and even if you did not get some part of the material, you can always return to it later, rewatch the video, and address the community for additional assistance.\n\nThe not-so-positive aspect of online education is that it may take a long time for you to get feedback. Sometimes, your assignments will be checked by your teacher, but most likely you will have to address your fellow students for feedback and assistance (Udemy). Although instructors are encouraged to interact with their students as often as possible, let us not forget that one teacher may have thousands of students all over the world. Naturally, it is impossible for him or her to check all of the assignments. And although you can still count on help from other students, this fact can still be disappointing.\n\nAlso, let us not forget that in some countries, a digital certificate is not a legitimate proof of your skills. A person with a diploma from a college or university will often have a preference over a student with a certificate from an online educational service. This is especially true for such professions as nurses, pharmaceutical technicians, mechanics, and other specialists whose skills cannot be obtained via watching a video, or whose jobs are highly demanding (Best Colleges). In other cases, although it is skill that matters, formal education is still more attractive for potential employers. There are companies that care about what you can do rather than what college you graduated from, but it can take you time to find them.\n\nOverall, it can be said that online education is a reasonable choice for people who want to study, and who know what they need. Although there are some disadvantages to such a method of studying–difficulties with assignment checks, for instance, or prejudice against online certificates–it is still a great option for anyone who wants to know more. Studying at one’s own pace, flexibility, and the high quality of educational materials–this is what makes online studying platforms popular across the world.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the history of New York City?n\n###\n\n","completion":" New York City is one of the most famous metropolises in the world. It is not only a huge business hub, but also an American cultural symbol for opportunity, hard work, energy, and eclecticism. But have you ever wondered about the history of this great city? If you have, you will enjoy the following paragraphs on New York City’s prehistory, European settlement, and modern development.\n\nNative Americans were the first inhabitants of the area of New York City. The Lenape people were the main residents in this land, and they spoke the Algonquian language (Kraft, Herbert). These people used the waterways in their surroundings for fishing, hunting trips, trade, and even war. In fact, many of the main trails of the Lenape are now major thoroughfares in New York, such as Broadway (Foote, Thelma Wills). Before European settlers came, the Lenape had agriculture, developed hunting techniques, and were managing their resources with ease. They even were harvesting large amounts of fish and shellfish (Kurlansky, Mark). According to estimates, there were around 80 settlements of the Lenape with a population of approximately 5,000 when European settlers came (Stanford Web Archive Timeline).\n\nItalian voyager Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to visit the area, which was in 1524 (Morison, Samuel Eliot). But he did not stay for long, and it was not until 1609 when English employee of the Dutch East India Company, Henry Hudson, was looking for a westerly passage to Asia and instead found a fine spot for beaver pelts. Hudson’s report about the beaver population of the New York City area prompted the Dutch to create trading colonies there (Sandler, Corey). Through 1624-1625, the founding of the first Dutch fur trading post was where what is now Lower Manhattan (New York City Department of Parks & Recreation). In 1626, the creation of Fort Amsterdam was initiated. Through the bringing of African slaves to the settlement, construction improved and blossomed, but there was animosity between the Native Americans and the settlers. In February of 1643, there was the Pavonia Massacre in the area known as present-day Jersey City, but a peace treaty was eventually made on August 29th of 1645 (Ellis, Edward Robb). Shorty after, in 1652, the colony was granted self-governance.\n\nHowever, Dutch rule was short lived. The English took over the colony, renaming it “New York” in honor of the Duke of York in 1664 (Homberger, Eric). It became a colony of the Kingdom of England and subsequently of Great Britain. In the hands of the British, New York burgeoned into a full-scale city. From 1678 to 1694, 384 houses grew to 983, with a mix of African (slaves and free), Dutch, English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish people (Harris, Leslie M). Unfortunately, through war and massacre, the population of the Lenape shrunk to about 200. On the other hand, the slave trade under British rule continued to boost manpower and also Africans and Caribbeans acted as servants within homes.\n\nWith the introduction of the Stamp Act and other taxation measures created by the British government, the colonists became agitated under oppression. Official resistance to British authority began in 1765 with The Stamp Act Congress, and it eventually resulted in the American Revolution starting in the same year. The Revolution lasted until 1783 under the leadership of General George Washington with the aid of France and other countries. The 13 colonies built the Continental Army, and through much tribulation, were able to drive out the British Army from New York and the other colonies. Serving as the first constitution of America, the Articles of Confederation was made in 1785 by Congress in New York City, and by 1798, New York City became the national capital of the United States according to the new United States Constitution. You can say this was the true start of the modern New York City.\n\nFrom a relatively peaceful Native American settlement of the Lenape people to American rule, New York City has had a bloody, tumultuous history of banner-changing, massacres, mass fires, slavery, and revolt. Now the focal point of American urban culture and business, one can easily forget what it came from.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the main causes of homelessness?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When we see homeless people around our cities or towns, we may not think about how they got into their circumstance. We mostly pass them by and try our best to ignore them. However, sometimes we may become curious about how people land up in this situation. There are over 100 million individuals who are homeless at this time, according to the United Nations (Homeless World Cup). So, understanding the reasons behind homelessness is imperative.\n\nPoverty is perhaps the main cause of homelessness (The Salvation Army). Being born or brought into poverty through circumstances beyond one’s control is an easy route to being without a home. With half of the world’s population living on $2.50 a day, it is clear that becoming homeless is not that difficult (DoSomething.org).\n\nUnemployment is another main cause of homelessness. With the world unemployment rate at 7.9% in 2017, it is not surprising that many people find it hard to sustain a living space (www.indexmundi.com).\n\nThe lack of affordable housing through gentrification and fastly growing local economies is another qualm. Even people with one or two jobs cannot afford proper housing in places like New York City and Seattle. The global housing crisis is only getting worse by year, and this will lead to more and more people becoming homeless (CityLab).\n\nSadly, about 450 million individuals worldwide have mental health issues, and often lack adequate care from government agencies. And strangely, many people who have an opportunity to use treatment services do not use these tools (World Health Organization). This can lead to unemployment and in turn, a lack of funds to pay for housing.\n\nDrug and alcohol abuse is another common source of homelessness. According to the World Health Organization, “At least 15.3 million persons have drug use disorders” (“Facts and Figures”). People who are addicted to drugs and\/or alcohol often cannot have a steady job, and this causes them to eventually live on the streets. Their family members are often dismissive of them and refuse to care for them due to their condition.\n\nWith another form of abuse, gambling, homelessness can become possible. With about 1.6 billion people gambling each year, it is clear there is an addiction to this activity, despite its almost impossible odds of winning (Lancelot, Marilyn). Having enough money is the key factor in not becoming homeless, and those with a gambling addiction can easily lose all their funds, including their savings (The Salvation Army).\n\nIn addition, tumultuous family environments can readily be a cause of homelessness. With domestic violence and sexual misconduct at home, many young people choose to leave their residences to live on the streets. CNN reported that, “Thirty-five percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and\/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence, according to the United Nations” (“Domestic (Intimate Partner) Violence Fast Facts”). And, these are just the statistics about women without consideration of the physical and sexual violence done against boys and men.\n\nAs homelessness continues to grow worldwide, it becomes more and more important to comprehend why it is happening. Due to poverty, unemployment, unaffordable housing, poor physical and mental health, drug and alcohol abuse, gambling addiction, and bad family environments, homelessness is rampant. Increasing financial and social services for those on the brink of homelessness worldwide should be a solution, but it is easier said than done.###"}
{"prompt":"How did reality television first begin to appear and why?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Reality television is a highly-watched form of television worldwide that features unscripted (mostly) shows of people’s personal lives. Why? I think it has to do with the fact that people are curious about how other people are running their lives and what peculiarities are present in the human condition. And also, strangely, people often like to watch other people in trouble or involved in dramas, as it makes their lives seem less stressful and more normal. Anyways, when did reality television first begin to appear and why? We will answer these questions in the following paragraphs.\n\nReality television is much older than most people suspect. It all began in the late 1940s with Queen for a Day, which aired from 1945 to 1964. Though this American TV game show was centered on women winning prizes, there was a portion of the show that featured women talking in an unscripted manner about their financial difficulties and family life in order to elicit a reaction from the audience (A Complete Directory to Prime Time Cable and Network TV Shows). After this semi-reality show came Cash and Carry in 1946, which sometimes showed contestants performing stunts (this is another form of unscripted behavior). But it was not until 1948 that the so-called prototype of modern reality shows came about with Candid Camera. It was a show based solely on people’s reactions to pranks, and all the participants were not aware of the pranks beforehand (Rowan, Beth). This show laid the groundwork for many spin offs of its concept, and for the genre of reality shows in general, with its highly improvised manner of filming.\n\nAlso airing in 1948, Ted Mack’s Original Amateur Hour and Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts revolved around featuring amateur performers and audience voting that is akin to today’s American Idol, X Factor, and The Voice. More game shows started to pop up in the 1950s, like Beat the Clock and Truth or Consequence. They continued the trend of silly competitions, spontaneous stunts, and pranks. Airing in 1958, Confession was the first reality show about police and criminals, which displayed interviews with criminals about their backgrounds. This undoubtedly led to the countless police reality shows that are present today (McNeil, Alex). These shows demonstrated that audiences enjoyed knowing the inner workings of not only everyday people, but also those who do crime. Reality TV was getting more serious—it was not just a way to watch people do ridiculous things or have light-hearted reactions to people’s pitfalls.\n\nA unique concept for reality television began in the United Kingdom with Seven Up! in 1964. It focused (and still does) on the lives of 12 regular 7-year-olds and their thoughts about what is going on around them. Surprisingly, the show is still being aired, as each 7 years, a film is dedicated to the lives of these 12 boys (now men). All these participants have become celebrities in their own right. Though the show is based on interviews and has no inherent plot, the audience’s fascination with the lives and growth of these individuals has made the show popular and a progenitor of similar shows (The Post-Standard).\n\nAnd finally, the precursor to more shallow reality television, Chelsea Girls directed by Andy Warhol had no direction. The film was simply about his acquaintances’ lives. The Radio Times Guide to Film 2007 noted that Chelsea Girls is “to blame for reality television” (Baracaia, Alexa). There were shows with no direction before, but it did not seem to have any real value.\n\nReality TV is all about diving into the personal, intimate lives of others, and seeing their reactions to certain situations. In the 1940s and the 1950s, the groundwork for modern reality television was laid by such shows as Candid Camera, Original Amatuer Hour, and Confession. Now reality TV is a standard for worldwide viewers, and sometimes the most popular shows being broadcast.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some examples of paranormal activity that cannot be explained by science?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Since the dawn of civilization, human beings have had the need to study and explain the world around them. Primeval tribes believed in all kinds of spirits inhabiting animate and inanimate objects around them. Ancient Greeks and Egyptians made significant advances in natural sciences such as mathematics, astronomy, and biology. What could not be explained yet was ascribed to divine entities. Christian tradition gave a start and fueled the development of a number of theological and philosophical studies, shaping outlooks many people share even today. Whereas God still remained the main force standing behind everything existing in the world, science and rational thinking gradually conquered the minds of people. The 20th century with its scientific breakthroughs and technological revolutions has left little space to the unexplained. Today, this space continues to shrink.\n\nAt the same time, the more we learn, the more questions arise. It is an eternal paradox: the more knowledge is gained, the more there is to explain and discover. It is unlikely that science will ever give all the answers–and thus, there will always be room for speculations, superstitions, and fears. Throughout the course of history, human beings feared a lot of things: forces of nature, gods and demons, vampires and ghosts–the list is lengthy. Mostly being caused by ignorance, these fears changed along with humanity’s understanding of the world around. Ghosts have been extruded by radioactive monsters, demons have given way to UFOs and aliens, and instead of nature, we now fear rogue artificial intelligence and robot uprisings. It can be said that fears remain the same–it is but their shell, or form, that has changed.\n\nThere are, however, phenomenons that cannot be explained neither scientifically, nor by the tricks of an ignorant mind. Witnessed by numerous people, carefully documented by unbiased parties, and registered with electronic equipment, these phenomenons can be fairly called “paranormal” for the lack of a better term. Not necessarily mystical, occult, or supernatural in their nature, they yet await for satisfactory explanation. Here are just some of the examples.\n\nEveryone knows the expression, “I am on fire.” In everyday situations, it means that a person saying it is on a winning streak, or is extremely productive\/creative\/successful doing something. However, in the case of spontaneous human combustion (SHC), its meaning turns from figurative to literal. The first reported case of SHC was recorded in 1400s, when an Italian knight Polonus Vorstius known for his passion for alcohol was seen bursting into flames from the inside (io9). During the course of history, other cases were recorded as well. For example, in 1951, Mary Reeser–a 67-year old widow from Florida–died from a spontaneous combustion that happened when she was sitting in her easy chair. According to the reports of police officers and firemen, all that was left from Mary Reeser was her ankle and about 10 pounds of what was left from her body. Her skull shrunk to a size of a teacup (Anomalies). Almost the same happened in 1986, when a fireman George Matt was found dead in his apartment in New York: all that was left of him was his leg, his skull, and his rib cage (CYA). There were numerous similar cases reported. The damage to the surrounding caused by SHC is not significant. It mainly affects the body, leaving little to none of it, whereas the environment mostly remains intact.\n\nAnother kind of paranormal activity that has been witnessed for centuries is poltergeist. It has something in common with ghost stories featuring an invisible force interacting with the living–except that ghost stories often turn out to be hoaxes. Poltergeist activity, however, is much more difficult to simulate, and there have been at least several cases that could not be explained scientifically. One of them is the Enfield Poltergeist. In 1977 and 1978 it was a sensation, mostly because many of the ghost’s manifestations had been recorded on film. Some of the photos depict Janet Hodgson–a middle daughter in the family whose house was haunted by the poltergeist–in near-impossible leaps, as she was thrown around her room by an invisible force. Police officers and the investigators of paranormal activity who inspected Hodgsons’ house often reported equipment malfunction upon entering the building. Despite skeptics constantly looking for arguments to disprove the story of the Enfield haunting, it still remains one of the most credible poltergeist stories so far.\n\nAn undeniably true but still unbelievable occurrence happened to Jean Hilliard from Minnesota in 1980. She was on her way home late at night when her car stopped working. Jean had just a mile or two left to the point of her destination, so she decided to walk on foot–her friend’s house was located about two miles away. Later in the morning, she was found lying on the ground, frozen in a rock-solid condition. When she was delivered to the hospital, doctors could not puncture her body with needles to make tests. Thermometers did not show Jean’s body temperature because it was lower than the one they were designed to display. The most incredible part of the story is that Jean was alive all along. As she thawed, her body gradually regained mobility, and all of her body functions were restored. After spending some time in the hospital, Jean was released home, and reported no negative health effects afterwards (Snopes).\n\nPeople today feel comfortable thinking that the world around them can be explained in terms of science and rationalism. Relying on logic and knowledge, modern people believe there is nothing supernatural left to be afraid or aware of. In practice, this is not always true. Scientists still encounter phenomenon they cannot explain: spontaneous human combustion cases, poltergeist activities, or cases such as the one that occurred with Jean Hilliard support this statement well enough.###"}
{"prompt":"How did fashion originate?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Fashion has taken the world by storm. Even common people strive to buy designer clothes, and fashion is constantly evolving. It even seems to be developing at faster rates and into more unusual expressions. However, have you ever wondered where fashion itself came from and how it came about? We will look at the ancient origins of fashion first, then look into the beginning of the modern fashion industry to understand more about this integral aspect of today’s world society.\n\nThere was no evidence of how people dressed until we found remains and artifacts of people who came together as groups and villages. The greater the number of people, the easier it is to examine their fashion history. The first noted well-recorded culture resides in Mesopotamia between 5000-3500 BCE (Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians). But during these ancient times, fashion as we know it was not present. According to our best evidence, there was no type of clothing that was popular for a limited time. Rather, clothes rarely changed their look and style during the times of these first cultures. Alterations in clothing from culture to culture were gradual, and were changed usually according to need rather than expression. Sometimes traditional artwork was added to clothes, which carried significant meaning in the context of these cultures. In other words, clothes were not made out of novelty, but out of tradition and necessity (LoveToKnow).\n\nThough physical direct evidence of clothing in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and other lands is often hard to come by, there is an ample amount of artistic and written records about clothing from olden times. Some rituals for the dead involved clothing, and these remnants have also been useful to scientists. According to LoveToKnow, “Although local practices varied, both men and women often wore the same garment types. These were skirts of various lengths; shawls, or lengths of woven fabric of different sizes and shapes that could be draped or wrapped around the body; and tunics, T-shaped garments similar to a loose-fitting modern T-shirt, that were made of woven fabric in varying lengths. E. J. W. Barber (1994) suggests that the Latin word tunica derives from the Middle Eastern word for linen and she believes that the tunic originated as a linen undergarment worn to protect the skin against the harsh, itchy feel of wool. Later tunics were also used as outerwear and were made from fabrics of any available fibers” (LoveToKNow). Additionally, in the ancient world, most cultures used a loincloth for undergarments. In terms of shoes, sandals were the most popular footwear, though boots were used to ride horses and emerged in mountainous areas (LoveToKNow).\n\nAlthough volumes could be written on ancient clothing, let us fast forward to the origin of modern fashion. Before the 1800s, fashion as we know it, with its limited appeal and constantly evolving sensibilities, was practically nonexistent. This was due to the reliance on spinning yarn from sheep, and weaving cloth at a slow rate. But, as Fashionista states, “The cycle of fashion finally picked up speed during the Industrial Revolution, which introduced new textile machines, factories and ready-made clothing, or clothing that is made in bulk in a range of sizes rather than being made to order. First patented in 1846, the sewing machine contributed to an extremely rapid fall in the price of clothing and an enormous increase in the scale of clothing manufacturing. Outside of couture houses, localized dressmaking businesses were responsible for making clothing for middle-class women, while women of lower incomes continued to make their own clothing”  (Idacavage, Sara). Local dressmakers began to comprise workrooms, akin to sweatshops. This focus on efficiency began with the Industrial Revolution, and designers for elite and middle-class people sprang up. Paul Poiret (1879-1944) dressed the finest people in Paris before World War I, Jeanne Lanvin (1867-1946) built the longest-running fashion house and was the first fashion mogul, Madeleine Vionnet (1867-1975) had 1,000 staff at her hand and rejected the famous corset, and Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel (1883-1971) introduced gender-neutral clothing and built the most famous brand ever in fashion (The Business of Fashion). These are the progenitors of modern western fashion, and it is not surprising they all came from France, as this country has been at the helm of fashion for the entire span of modern fashion history.\n\nClothing was originally made according to tradition and necessity, but later became a novelty through the progression of the Industrial Revolution. With the creation of the local sweat shop, local designers eventually made brands. The first four great fashion designers came from France, and to this day, France is regarded as the premier location for fashion.###"}
{"prompt":"How does meditation positively affect our health, psychological state, and sense of satisfaction?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" People should meditate for various reasons. Meditation is not just a fad, or a cultural aspect, or an act hippies do. Meditation has been shown to positively affect our health, psychological state, and sense of satisfaction. There are many forms of meditation, however the forms of meditation that center on achieving mental silence, such as Sahaja Yoga Meditation and Zen meditation, have been clinically proven to be the most effective types of meditation. Below, I will explore how this variety of meditation aids us in our health, mental state, and our sense of contentment.\n\nMeditation has been shown to benefit those with high-blood pressure, with physical pain, with poor immune systems, and more. In fact, Dr. Ramesh Manocha, senior lecturer at the Department of Psychiatry at Sydney University, notes that meditation has a widespread application on one’s health. “Negative feelings ranging from stress, depression and even artificially induced feelings in laboratory studies have frequently been shown to have negative effects on the body’s resistance to disease. Depression, and even current depressive feelings, or just a history of depression all have been associated with increased risk of heart disease. Hopelessness is one symptom of depression that appears to have particularly adverse effects on health. One study reported that a single question about hopelessness predicted a nearly doubling of risk of fatal and nonfatal heart disease” (Beyond The Mind). There are many other effects negative thinking has on our body, such as high blood pressure, the dryness of the mouth, and more. As should be known, our thoughts have a direct influence on our physical state.\n\nSince meditation deals with reducing or even eliminating the chatter of the mind, it can be assumed that meditation can solve psychological problems in practitioners as well. Many psychological issues, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, and more issues can be assuaged if thoughts diminish or disappear. According to the website Meditation Research, “A study conducted at the University of Vienna found a significant beneficial effect of Sahaja Yoga Meditation on state and trait anxiety in healthy adults. A group of 37 adults was taught Sahaja Yoga Meditation for 8 weeks and compared to a group of 32 adults who received no intervention and a group of 32 adults who had to listen to music of Mozart. The group who received Meditation showed a significant reduction in their levels of state and of trait anxiety compared to both controls and to the group that listened to Mozart” (Meditation Research). This is just one example of many studies about Sahaja Yoga Meditation and other forms of meditation that have alleviated psychological issues. With a calm mind and a healthy body, it is easier to have a sense of contentment.\n\nHappiness is something each person seems to be searching for. Meditation has been shown to make people more content with themselves and their surroundings through an inner acceptance of reality. In the words of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, the founder of Sahaja Yoga Meditation, “The joy is not that you laugh loud. The joy is not that you’re always smiling. It is the stillness, the quietude within yourself, the peace of your being, of your spirit that asserts itself into vibrations which you feel. When you feel that peace, you feel like the light of the sun, the whole rays of that beauty spreading” (Freemeditation.com Meditation Basics). Knowing and feeling that inner peace allows one to be peaceful, and thus content with oneself. This contentment does not need to only come when one is meditating or in a meditative mood. It is suggested that the contentment one feels in meditation carries over into our days and nights, which leads us to feeling more happy overall.\n\nMeditation, especially the forms of it that focus on mental silence, have been shown to lead to healthier lives physically, mentally, and emotionally. Not only is meditation a fashion or an alternative way of perceiving reality, but it is a medically-sound way to improve your overall well being.###"}
{"prompt":"How did weddings originate?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Weddings seem like a natural part of our human existence. But they did not pop out of nowhere: they originated from ancient traditions. There are countless wedding traditions from across the globe, and it is difficult to pinpoint when weddings started to take place. However, through evidence and approximation, we can assume various facts about when the first weddings took place.\n\nApproximately 23,000 years ago, when people started to grow their own food, and began to live in more compact communities, marriages probably were initiated. People staying closer together, instead of being nomadic, was most likely the first cause of marriages. Before agriculture, it might have been common for people to have a spouse for a few years and then move onto another partner due to the nomadic way of life and a lack of organization in terms of settlement (Adshade, Marina). According to the website Yesterday, “Early marriage was borne of ancient societies’ need to secure a safe environment in which to breed, handle the granting of property rights, and protect bloodlines. But even in these early times, marriage was much about love and desire as it was social and economic stability” (Yesterday Channel). It is surprising, but the reason for marriage has hardly changed since ancient times, with finances and feelings intermixed in the decision to get married.\n\nLike many things, marriage by law began in ancient Egypt. Ancient Egyptian society coalesced around 3100 BC (Digital Egypt for Universities), and unfortunately incest was an integral part of the royal Egyptian society at that time. According to Wedding Zone, “Many Pharaohs took sisters and daughters amongst their numerous wives, the idea being to keep their dynastic bloodline truer than it would otherwise had been. Although, this practice was not that common among middle and lower classes. Here, the marriage also existed as a legally enforceable fact, and the wives actually had more rights in this ancient land than for a large segment of modern western history, including the right of divorce” (Wedding Zone). In its turn, the wedding engagement was also founded in Egypt, where the couple would retain all the rights one would have in an actual wedding and would be a test period for the actual marriage. Like many ancient cultures, a dowry was involved. Unlike dowries in India, the man would pay the bride’s family money in order to show that he was capable of providing for his future wife. The wedding itself involved loads of colors, songs, dancing, and fresh wheat being thrown by participants to wish the married couple fertility.\n\nSince ancient Egyptian society and culture was so grandiose and influential, it is no surprise that other societies around that time started to have weddings as well. In the Old Testament, there are several instances describing marriage and weddings in ancient Israel. According to Bible Odyssey, “First, although girls were expected to be virgins when they got married—and according to Deut 22:21 could even be put to death if they were found not to be—men were allowed to marry multiple women. It is hard to know how common polygamy really was in ancient Israel. Also, the evidence suggests that compared to women, men had more control over whom they married. Most likely, girls were married around puberty whereas men were somewhat older. Though unions were generally based more on economic or social considerations than romantic ones, some texts, including the Song of Songs, show us that ideas of passion and sexual love were also present in ancient Israel” (Covenant in the Hebrew Bible). But it was not until the Roman Empire that marriage started to incorporate the modern practices of handing over rings and such. It was believed in ancient Rome that marriage was the only legitimate way to produce children and to have a dignified standing in society. Also, iron rings were given in wedding ceremonies, and soon after the couple would sacrifice an animal and ask blessings from the gods for their marriage. The basis of western weddings came from the Roman Empire (Rome Across Europe).\n\nThere can be volumes more to say about the development of the wedding ceremony, however we have limited space in this essay. But we should mention that weddings developed out of agriculture, which made communities less nomadic. Weddings began as a way to secure a family unit, though marrying within the family (incest) and being polygamy was not often frowned upon in the ancient world. It was not until the end of the Roman Empire that polygamy was formally banned. From then on, monogamy became more of a standard, and what we often know of today as married life in the modern world.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the reasons for the popularity of veganism?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is now a fashion in developed countries to be a vegan. With all the mistreatment of animals in factories and farms, animal hunting, and all the chemicals injected into animals raised as future food, countless people have chosen to be vegans. What exactly is a vegan? A vegan is an individual who chooses to not use or consume animal products in regard to food, clothing, and other uses based on principles, health, and the environment.\n\nFirst, we can provide a brief history of veganism. Time magazine explains that, “…though the term was coined in 1944, the concept of flesh-avoidance can be traced back to ancient Indian and eastern Mediterranean societies. Vegetarianism is first mentioned by the Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras of Samos around 500 BCE. In addition to his theorem about right triangles, Pythagoras promoted benevolence among all species, including humans. Followers of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism also advocated vegetarianism, believing that humans should not inflict pain on other animals” (Suddath, Claire). Vegetarianism originally caught on in the West through the religious sect The Ephrata Cloister in 1732 in Pennsylvania, but it was not until 1944 when Britisher Donald Watson created the term “vegan” for people who are vegetarians that also do not eat eggs and dairy products. Watson could not have foreseen the impact his new term would have in the future.\n\nVeganism is most often a choice—not a dietary plan or prescribed diet from a doctor. According to The Vegan Society, “Vegans avoid exploiting animals for any purpose, with compassion being a key reason many choose a vegan lifestyle. From accessories and clothing to makeup and bathroom items, animal products and products tested on animals are found in more places than you might expect” (The Vegan Society). Most vegans agree with the scientific assertion that humans are just another animal, albeit more developed and sophisticated. Therefore, in our advancement, we should not, as most vegans believe, harm other animals for our own purposes.\n\nIn terms of health, scientific studies have proven that the vegan diet is often more nutritional than the average diet. As The Vegan Society states, “More and more people are turning to a vegan diet for the health benefits: increased energy, younger looking skin and eternal youth are just some of the claims from enthusiastic plant eaters. Well-planned plant-based diets are rich in protein, iron, calcium and other essential vitamins and minerals. The plant-based sources of these nutrients tend to be low in saturated fat, high in fibre and packed with antioxidants, helping mitigate some of the modern world’s biggest health issues like obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer” (The Vegan Society). Also, eating meat is hard on the liver and other organs, whereas a plant-based diet is less troublesome to these organs.\n\nMany vegans believe that veganism is a solution to environmental issues. According to Your Daily Vegan, “Raising animals for food is the single greatest human-caused source of destruction to our environment. It is the largest source of greenhouse gases, land use and degradation; the number one source of water pollution and rainforest deforestation. It’s also a major contributor to air pollution, ocean dead zones, habitat loss, and species extinction” (Your Daily Vegan). All the materials used to house and maintain these animals are also detrimental to the environment. The statistics about land usage and deforestation in connection to farming animals for food are alarming. Your Daily Vegan points out that, “Raising animals for food uses 45% of Earth’s total land and is responsible for up to 91% of Amazon destruction, with 1-2 acres of rainforest being cleared every second” (Your Daily Vegan). This shows that if more people took up the vegan diet, land usage and deforestation would substantially lessen.\n\nThough veganism is popular nowadays, it began as a religious and eventually mundane practice. However, currently, veganism is connected to the philosophy of being harmonious with other animals (we are animals too, according to science) and not wanting to cause them harm in any form—whether it be through food processing, clothing, and the products we use. Veganism is promoted as a health and environmental solution to many issues. Therefore, it should not be discounted as only a fad.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the story of Walmart?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Walmart is an ubiquitous sight is many countries. This American multinational retail corporation is loathed, loved, and everything in between for various reasons. It is the world’s largest retail company based on revenue. However, what is important for this paper is exploring the origins and development of this corporation. The story of Walmart is not only a story about a company, but also about capitalism and the American Dream.\n\n1950 was not just an important economic year for America in terms of growth, but also when Walmart opened up for business. Sam Walton did not create his own shop initially, but bought out a shop in Bentonville, Arkansas. He called the first shop “Walton’s 5 & 10” or “Walton’s Five and Dime” (Vance H. Trimble). According to Walmart’s official website, “Inspired by the early success of his dime store, and driven to bring even greater opportunity and value to his customers, Sam opened the first Walmart in 1962 at the age of 44 in Rogers, Arkansas” (Walmart Corporate). This is when the Walmart chain began to develop. The founder’s idea for success was to offer lower prices than competitors with quality service, and it seemed that it worked. It had led to success for other discount stores at the time, and Walton was inspired by them (Vance H. Trimble).\n\nBob Bogle, Walton’s assistant, recommended the name “Wal-Mart” for the second store, and the chain itself. The name stuck and it has been used ever since (albeit without the hyphen in later years) (Vance H. Trimble). With the economic boom of the 1950s into the 1960s, Walmart continued its rapid growth. There were 24 Walmart stores by 1967 in the state of Arkansas. In the following year, Walmart finally moved out of Arkansas, and opened its first stores in Missouri and Oklahoma (Wayback Machine).\n\nAnother pivotal moment in Walmart’s history was when the company went public. According to Walmart’s official website, “The company went public in 1970, and the proceeds financed a steady expansion of the business. Sam credited the rapid growth of Walmart not just to the low costs that attracted his customers, but also to his associates. He relied on them to give customers the great shopping experience that would keep them coming back. Sam shared his vision for the company with associates in a way that was nearly unheard of in the industry. He made them partners in the success of the company, and firmly believed that this partnership was what made Walmart great” (Walmart Corporate). In light of this, the company’s first stock split was in 1972, and it was the appropriate time for this, as Walmart was now working in five states: Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Oklahoma. The growth of Walmart exploded in the years following this event. Walmart opened in Tennessee in 1973, Kentucky and Mississippi in 1974, and in Texas in 1975. By this interval, there were 125 stores with over 7000 staff members. Sales had reached an astronomical $340.3 million, which was grand for a chain of discount stores at the time.\n\nWith the expansion of stories in Illinois in 1977, the company made its first corporate acquisition. Walmart bought out Mohr-Value Stores, which were placed in Missouri and Illinois. Walmart would continue this trend of acquisition to eliminate competition (Cape Girardeau Bulletin). The following year, Walmart also acquired the Hutcheson Store Company, and seemed to know no end of its ambition, as it branched out into different products, such as jewelry, auto service, and pharmaceutical goods. From this point, Walmart only expanded more and seemed to never look back. It also created Sam’s Club, a warehouse membership-only store, and expanded Walmart across each state of the US, eventually entering the South American and Chinese markets as an international powerhouse. To date, the store is still acquiring more companies, expanding its business, and has a revenue of $500.3 billion and a value of around $250 billion.\n\nStarting as a discount retail store in humble Arkansas, Walmart has taken the world by storm with its low prices and variety of services. The company has had exponential growth by acquiring many companies, not only limiting competition, but also making stores more profitable at a faster rate. Walmart has had a steady growth since its opening, and who knows what developments it will make as a company in the coming years.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the American dream?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What is the American dream? It does not pertain only to immigrants, or even native-born citizens. It is rather an ideological premise of democracy, rights, liberty, opportunity, and equality, where any person has the chance to reach one’s goals—whether that be financial, spiritual, or otherwise. First, the phrase was developed in the 1700s, and later developed in the 19th and 20th centuries. Let us explore how this concept originated and how it has changed throughout the centuries.\n\nThe term “American dream” was first referred to in the 17th century by the puritans. The puritans arrived in America to find religious freedom. According to the website American Dream, “In 1630, a speech known as the “city upon a hill” sermon was delivered by John Winthrop to the other puritan settlers who traveled with him to Massachusetts. It is true that he didn’t describe his belief as a “dream”, [but] he still talked about an ideal nation that gives all the people with equal opportunities to become successful through using their greatest efforts. In 1776, Thomas Jefferson and other authors of The Declaration of Independence defined the American Dream as “life, liberty and pursuit of happiness” (The American Dream). So, though it started as a vision for religious freedom, the American dream expanded into a freedom in all spheres of American life. The expansion of this ideal was one of the progressive happenings in modern politics.\n\nIn the 19th century, the American dream meant something special to Germans. In 1848, they fled a revolution in protest of an autocratic political structure in their home country to come to the US (F. W. Bogen). According to book The German in America, “[In America] wealth and possession of real estate confer not the least political right on its owner above what the poorest citizen has. Nor are there nobility, privileged orders, or standing armies to weaken the physical and moral power of the people, nor are there swarms of public functionaries to devour in idleness credit for. Above all, there are no princes and corrupt courts representing the so-called divine ‘right of birth.’ In such a country the talents, energy and perseverance of a person … have far greater opportunity to display than in monarchies” (F. W. Bogen). In addition, with the gold rush starting from 1849, the conception of striking it rich in America led thousands of people to the New World to follow their dream of riches. In fact, it is often believed that the American dream we know of now was formed by the pioneers (Turner, Frederick Jackson).\n\nThe term “American dream” in the 20th century became more associated with a break away from class divisions and racial segregation. In his 1931 book Epic of America, James Truslow Adams popularized the term of American dream: “But there has been also the American dream, that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for every man, with opportunity for each according to his ability or achievement. It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position…” (Library of Congress). On the other hand, the civil rights movement was headed by Martin Luther King Jr., who wrote about the American dream in his Letter from a Birmingham Jail: “We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands … when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judeo-Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.” So, in the 20th century, the American dream expanded into more deeply-rooted issues in society rather than material gain.\n\nThe usage of the term “American dream” began with the puritans when referring to their right for religious freedom, but it later progressed into a more philosophical notion of the equality of all people in light of status or standing. With the current political climate in Washington, we will see if the American dream stays intact or is once again reformed.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the causes and symptoms of the fear of success?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Everyone has probably heard about the fear of failure. In fact, it has become such a popular explanation and excuse for not doing something that it often sounds almost trivial–even though it is a real psychological condition causing a lot of distress to those who suffer from it. At the same time, there is another, somewhat similar phobia which is often overlooked or neglected as insignificant: the fear of success.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem absurd: why would anyone be afraid of succeeding in his or her own life? Why would someone avoid–subconsciously or intentionally–accomplishing achievements, reaching goals, and fulfilling their dreams? The devil, as always, is in the details: the number of reasons for a person with the fear of success to worry is large. Unlike some people might think, many of these reasons are rational. Let us take a closer look at what may cause such a phobia and how it manifests itself.\n\nTo start with, let us figure out what success means. The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines success as a favorable and\/or desired outcome (Merriam-Webster). Expanding this definition, we may say that succeeding means achieving a desired result in a certain enterprise, activity, occupation, and so on. Each person has his or her criteria of success, but rather often they can be reduced to several categories: achieving a certain level of financial welfare; social recognition, fame, or popularity; professional growth and development; a happy marriage and parenthood, and so on. What is common for any form of success is that it can change a person’s life–and this is one of the main reasons why people can be so afraid of it.\n\nAll of us are familiar with the expression “to get out of one’s comfort zone.” Usually, it implies doing something unusual for us, something new, risky, etc. This is exactly what people with the fear of success are unlikely and unwilling to do. Success implies doing new things, being recognized in new ways, new workloads, new contacts, new demands and responsibilities–in other words, in case a person succeeds, there is too much novelty to deal with. Besides, getting into the spotlight implies being scrutinized, criticized, and discussed (99U). Public opinion can be harsh, even if “public” means ten people more than usual. Not everyone is prepared for such attention: even the fear of standing out, being a part of an ancient survival strategy, finds a way to manifest itself in such peculiar forms. It is much safer to stay on charted territory, going through the same routine over and over again, but keeping a habitual and comfortable lifestyle intact.\n\nA part of this fear of novelty and change is related to personality. An individual who fears success might feel he or she is going to change beyond recognition upon becoming successful. To some extent, this is similar to the fear of death: seizing to exist as  as the person who you are familiar with–and being “reborn” as a different individual, with a different set of values, habits, surrounding, occupations, and so on. This fear comes from a premise that the changes success brings require a person to completely abandon his or her older self (99U). In reality, change implies developing new qualities and habits atop of older ones. Your “older” personality does not disappear, you do not stop existing–you just acquire new traits, skills, and outlooks.\n\nSometimes the roots of the fear of success go deep into childhood traumas. If you were a talented child capable of writing poems or painting, for example, your peers might not accept you. Children can be cruel–not because they are evil, but because they have yet to learn compassion, empathy, and morals. So, they can attack those who stand out: because of fear, a lack of understanding, jealousy, or for other reasons. Anyways, a person who suffered from bullying in childhood may associate standing out, which success often implies, with being ostracized, and may try to avoid it by all means (LonerWolf). Self-doubt or feeling not worthy of success may also originate from childhood.\n\nWhatever the reasons, there are several common symptoms shared by many of those suffering from the fear of success. You might have the fear of success if you ever noticed yourself do the following: 1) starting new projects without completing any of them, or struggling to finish at least one; 2) working on each of the projects occupies a lot of your time, but you never concentrate on any of them enough; 3) being rarely satisfied with your work, always managing to find what to criticize yourself for, or depreciating yourself in other ways; 4) talking about your plans or things you want to do instead of doing them (Lifehack.org). Along with these, there are several other factors that might also point at you suffering from the fear of success: being hesitant or reluctant about sharing your work with others; sabotaging your own progress (procrastinating, wasting your energy on doing numerous insignificant tasks instead of focusing on what is important to you); second-guessing yourself, being doubtful about your “worthiness” of success, and so on.\n\nThe fear of success is a cunning and stealthy enemy. People nowadays are aware of the fear of failure–but many underestimate its “twin.” Originating from childhood traumas, the fear of standing out, novelty, and being a subject of public attention, the fear of success manifests itself in a number of ways. Reminding yourself that you are worthy of success, or counselling a psychologist, might be an effective step to eliminate this fear.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the most famous aspects of the Nile River?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The Nile is commonly known as the longest river in the world (6,853 kilometers), and a source of sustenance for countless ancient and modern civilizations. However, not many people know a great deal about its course, mythology, and history. Therefore, I would like to explore these aspects about this famous river in detail in order to educate readers.\n\nThere is some debate about where the original source of the river is. The tributaries of Kagera River in Burundi, such as Ruvyironza or the Nyabarongo, are feeder rivers that connect near Rusumo Falls on the Rwanda-Tanzania border (BBC News). These feeder rivers go into Lake Victoria, which is considered by many as the source of the Nile (McLeay, Cam). According to LiveScience, “Flowing northward through the tropical climate of eastern Africa and into the Mediterranean Sea, the river passes through 11 countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt” (Pedersen, Traci). Stretching through these nations, this great river has created and sustained civilizations for eons.\n\nSince this river has been such a prominent part of the history of so many nations, mythology has emerged about it. Egyptians have made the most mythology about the Nile. LiveScience says that, “In some myths, the Nile was considered a manifestation of the god Hapi who blessed the land with abundance, according to the Ancient History Encyclopedia. Isis, the goddess of the Nile and the “Giver of Life,” was believed to have taught the people how to farm and work the land. The water god Khnum, who ruled over all forms of water, even the lakes and rivers in the underworld, was believed to be in charge of the amount of silt that flooded the river banks every year. In later dynasties, Khnum branched out to become the god of rebirth and creation as well” (Pedersen, Traci). In each of the 11 countries that the Nile has coursed through, mythology has been created. A whole book could be written about it, and many have written books on this subject.\n\nNow that we have gone over the mythology of the Nile, let us look into the history of the Nile. According to the Ancient History Encyclopedia, “Permanent settlements gradually rose along the banks of the river beginning c. 6000 BCE and this was the beginning of Egyptian civilization and culture which became the world’s first recognizable nation state by c.3150 BCE” (Mark, Joshua J.). So, in a sense, the history of the Nile is the story of modern civilization. USHistory.org explains more about the beginning of this first nation, “Over time, however, despite being in the midst of desert surroundings, people discovered that the Nile River provided many sources of food. Along the river were fruit trees, and fish swam in the Nile in great numbers. Perhaps most importantly, they discovered that, at the same time each year, the Nile flooded for about six months. As the river receded, it deposited a rich, brown layer of silt that was suitable for growing wheat, beans, barley, or even cotton” (Independence Hall Association). This gave the inhabitants near the Nile a boost in learning about agriculture and developing farming methods to create a powerful nation.\n\nThe Nile River is famous for a number of reasons. Not only did it foster many ancient civilizations, including the first developed nation, it has garnered a great many mythological stories about it and connects many cultures from 11 countries. Without the Nile, the progress of worldwide civilizations would not have been so quick and would not have developed in the way that it did. Whether or not we believe in the mythology surrounding the Nile, it has a god-like importance in the history of modern civilization.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of using Uber?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If someone told you ten years ago that you would eagerly sit in a car of a stranger whom you found online, and feel completely safe while doing so, you probably would not believe it. Today, however, millions of users around the world do it on an everyday basis: Uber, the famous application allowing people to catch a ride anywhere, is what changed the way people thought about taxi services. If you own a car, you can become an Uber driver; if you have the application, you are almost guaranteed to have a car pick you up.\n\nIf you are for some reason not familiar with how Uber works, here is a short heads up. As a passenger, all you need to do is to open the application and insert the address you need to go to. Using GPS, the program will start looking for Uber drivers closest to your location. When you sit in the car, the application tracks your location until you arrive to your destination. You can pay with cash or with a card. After the ride is finished, you can rate the the services you were provided with. On the other hand, when taking orders as a driver, you never see neither destination, nor the cost of the ride–this information becomes available only if you accept the order. Both passengers and drivers can be fined for cancelling an order that has already been taken.\n\nAs practice shows, the service works fine. There are, however, several drawbacks–and even dangers–that not many people are aware of. As in the case of any system, flaws occur. And although Uber still remains one of the most convenient and safe taxi services, it is important to know about them. In particular, the list of dangers passengers may be subjected to includes rape and sexual assault, robbery, kidnapping, burglary, and even death–mostly because of car accidents, but sometimes because of shooting as well (Benedettolaw.com). But how does it become possible?\n\nThe major problem, perhaps, is that almost anyone owning a car can become a driver. If you have a clean criminal record, are healthy, drive responsibly, and your vehicle is in order, working for Uber might be a nice career option for you. You will have to pass a DMV and background check to ensure the safety of your passengers, and voila, you are hired. However, it turns out that these background checks are not always performed as thoroughly as they should. According to a journalistic investigation conducted by NBC4 for three months, many drivers working for Uber do have criminal records in the not-so-distant past. Among others, their crimes were burglary, reckless driving and\/or driving under the influence of alcohol, and assault. During the course of the investigation, NBC4 offered a reformed ex-convict woman with a history of drug possession, assault, and burglary to apply to become a driver for Uber. She went through all the registering procedures, and was informed about the background check. Normally, she would have been denied of the possibility to work as an Uber driver. However, four weeks later she was hired. This proves that sometimes the company treats the security of its passengers irresponsibly (Supermoney).\n\nAs a driver, however, you are sometimes even less safe. Even statistically, if you work on about 20 orders per day, five days a week, it equals riding with about 400 people per month. The chances someone among them might be violent, mentally ill, or just aggressive, are high. Of course, everyone knows that Uber tracks the location of both drivers and their passengers, so it should prevent potential attackers from acting out; there are other security measures as well. But still, the risks may be considerable. Besides, you may have problems with your insurance company if something goes wrong. For example, if you damage your car while working for Uber, your expenses may not be covered, as the insurance company can claim the case is beyond coverage (Neckerman Insurance Agency).\n\nThis can be especially worrying when you read the company’s Terms and Conditions carefully. As with many other companies, it does not take responsibility in the case of your death, rape, or trauma. So do many regular cab services, but their levels of security are higher. For instance, in addition to traditional documents such as a driver’s licence and criminal record, San Francisco taxi drivers need to have proof of residency, good health, and hygiene. In Los Angeles, they are obliged to provide their fingerprints and undergo a nationwide FBI criminal background check. With Uber, you have to rely on their background checks–which, as we have seen already, may not be thorough enough. There were several tragic incidents already. For example, in 2014 an Uber driver abducted a woman. In 2016, a driver named Jason Dalton killed six people on a shooting spree. Another driver, Roberto Chicas, attacked his passenger with a hammer (Supermoney). Of course, these cases are exceptional, and can happen anytime, regardless of the taxi service you are using. But still, this is a danger all passengers should be aware of.\n\nAlthough Uber and other similar services such as Lyft are statistically safe, convenient, and popular around the world, there are several dangers to be aware of. The major problem is posed by the company’s background checks: according to journalistic investigations, sometimes Uber drivers have a criminal record in the recent past. There were several cases of assault and kidnapping as well. Although such incidents are exceptional, it is important to treat one’s security responsibly, and take necessary precautionary measures.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the most common coping mechanisms for stress?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The word that probably describes living in big cities most accurately is “stress.” Indeed, the amount of responsibilities an average citizen must deal with on a daily basis, the numbers of people around, poor ecology, excessive workloads, relationship problems, and many other factors may affect our psychological condition greatly. Given that every person is unique, people develop different coping mechanisms in order to get rid of stress, or to at least alleviate its effects.\n\nSome of these mechanisms can be peculiar, while others are typical. For example, for some people, it is enough to go to a bar on Friday night, have a chat with a friend, or hit a gym; another person might need to change his or her entire lifestyle–downshift, for instance. It depends on the intensity of stress, and on individual tolerance towards it. Let us take a closer look at what coping mechanisms are among the most widespread.\n\nTo start with, what is a coping mechanism? According to psychologists Richard Lazarus and Susan Folkman, coping can be defined as an aggregate of behavioral and thinking strategies scientifically defined as the sum of cognitive and behavioral efforts aimed at the solution of internal or external problems. In other words, a coping mechanism is what a person does in order to solve the situation he or she finds uncomfortable. In this regard, it is also important to note that coping can be reactive and proactive. The former implies actions following stressful stimuli; the latter, on the contrary, means acting in order to prevent such stimuli from occurring (Explorable).\n\nAlthough people tend to generalize the term “stress,” it falls into several specific subcategories. In particular, the aforementioned Richard Lazarus believed stress could be divided into three major types: harm, threat, and challenge. The harm type refers to stress induced by damage that cannot be prevented. Post-traumatic stress disorder, for example, can be related to this subcategory. Stress from a breakup, from losing a large sum of money or something valuable is also harm stress. Threat stress is evoked when damage has not been dealt yet, but a person is already anticipating it. For instance, a person afraid to fly in airplanes may experience severe stress from expecting their plane to crash. Finally, challenge stress–the most healthy one, perhaps–comes from the situations when we face difficult circumstances, but feel confident about ourselves overcoming them. A professional beginning to work on a new difficult task may be experiencing challenge stress most often (The Psychologist).\n\nAnyways, how do people alleviate stress? What do they do to make themselves feel better, and are all of the coping mechanisms similarly efficient? It is plausible to divide them into two large categories: emotional and problem-focused coping. Emotional stress coping strategies include such behaviors as self-distraction, therapeutic talk (which may be done not only with a psychotherapist, but also with a friend: unlike many people tend to think, talking to a close friend may sometimes be as efficient as a psychotherapeutic session), or journaling. Religious people often find respite in praying or meditation. Among less healthy strategies are eating (meaning excessive food consumption levels, or eating unhealthy food such as sugary, fat, and so on), drinking alcohol, and doing drugs. A person may also try to suppress unpleasant sensations, or reframe his or her way of thinking in order to start perceiving the stressful situation from a different perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, there are problem-focused coping strategies. They imply acting rather than feeling, and is believed to be more effective than emotional strategies. Indeed, some of the problem-focused coping mechanisms are productive, especially compared to drinking or indulging in self-pitying talks. For instance, a person may start looking for ways to solve the problem causing the stress rather than just react to it emotionally. Or, a person may reorganize his or her habits and life in general in such a way that routine exercises do not take as much time and effort as usually–and thus decrease their levels of stress. A person may also build a system of social support–in other words, find people whom he or she may address in a time of need (Simply Psychology).\n\nEach of the mechanisms described above can be effective in their own way, even the destructive ones. After all, a person manages to alleviate his or her stress–and this is exactly the goal of a coping mechanism. However, it is important to distinguish between harmful and beneficial mechanisms, and to combine productive and constructive emotional and problem-focused strategies in order to manage stress more effectively.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the Carpathian Mountains?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" After the Scandinavian Mountains, the Carpathian Mountains is the longest mountain range in Europe. It stretches approximately 1500 kilometers through Central and Eastern Europe. More specifically, the Carpathians are present in Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Ukraine, Serbia, and Romania, with Romania occupying the most territory in this mountain range (The Official Travel Portal of Europe). There are three sections of the Carpathians: the Western Carpathians, the Eastern Carpathians, and the Southern Carpathians (Balkankul). There is even the Outer Carpathians, which is the northern rim of the Western and Eastern Carpathians. As you can see, this magnificent mountain range is massive, and it should be looked at closely to understand its grandiosity. Let’s take a look at the origin of its name, geography, and geology.\n\nThe name Carpathians has several origins, since it spans such a large range of countries. It is mostly associated with the Dacian tribe who were, in ancient times, called “Carpes.” They settled in a vast area, from the northeast of the Black Sea all the way to where present-day Romania and Moldova stand. Digging deeper, the word Carpates derives from the Proto Indo-European root *sker-\/*ker-. This root follows a path to the Albanian word karpë, which means “rock,” and to the Slavic word for rock or cliff, skála (Room, Adrian). At any rate, the word Carpathians has a rich history that dates back to the second century.\n\nThe highest altitudes in the Carpathians are in Slovakia at 2,500 meters, and the widest part of the mountains are in the Transylvanian plateau. In terms of snow being present all year in the Carpathians, only in the Tatra Mountains region can this be seen (Landform Evolution in Mountain Areas). The Carpathians are not that high compared to many other mountain ranges. In example, at its highest parts, it is only half the height of the highest altitudes in the Alps. In fact, the Alps and the Carpathians are separated by the Danube river, and these two mountain ranges meet in the Leitha Mountains in Bratislava. Also important to mention is that the Carpathians make up the watershed between the northern seas and the Black Sea. The Carpathians are surrounded by plains, namely the Pannonian plain, the Lower Danube, and the Glacian plain.\n\nThough the Alps are considerably close to the Carpathians, they have distinct geology. According to Britannica, “Their structure is less compact [than the Alps], and they are split up into a number of mountain blocks separated by basins. Structural elements also differ. The sandstone–shale band known as flysch, which flanks the northern margin of the Alps in a narrow strip, widens considerably in the Carpathians, forming the main component of their outer zone, whereas the limestone rocks that form a wide band in the Alps are of secondary importance in the Carpathians” (Kondracki, Jerzy A). There are more variances between these respected mountain ranges. “On the other hand, crystalline and metamorphic (heat-altered) rocks, which represent powerfully developed chains in the central part of the Alps, appear in the Carpathians as isolated blocks of smaller size surrounded by depressed areas. In addition to these features, the Carpathians contain a rugged chain of volcanic rocks” (Kondracki, Jerzy A). This gives us an understanding of the uniqueness of the Carpathians, and even each mountain range, as we can understand that even mountain systems that are close to each other can vary widely in geology.\n\nI hope this has been a proper glimpse into the technical information about the Carpathians. Of course, with its deep history, its wonderful geographical features, and its unique geology, it is best to witness its splendor in person. So, when you are visiting one of the countries that inhabit the Carpathians, be sure to visit this mountain range to see its majesty for yourself.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the pros and cons of gun control in the United States?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" As horrible as it sounds, almost every year the United States suffers at least one case of a mass shooting with lethal consequences. Such incidents occur in schools, office environments, student campuses, hotel lobbies, cafes, and many other public places. The news media highlights each of them in all details, often spreading–intentionally or not–the feeling of total insecurity among the population. Of course, not only the United States suffers from mass shootings. European countries such as France, Norway, Germany, and Great Britain have experienced similar problems in the not-so-distant past. However, there is a big difference: in Europe, mass shootings are often terrorism acts, committed by people with strong and radical political and\/or religious beliefs. Such was the case of the infamous Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik, or Paris shooting that happened in April 2017. In the United States, in its turn, such incidents happen, supposedly, because of extremely lax gun control laws–in addition to a plethora of other reasons.\n\nBut, in the first place, why is America holding its guns so dearly if it causes so much trouble?\n\nFirst of all, according to the Bill of Rights containing amendments to the American Constitution, any American citizen has a right to bear arms. This is the famous Second Amendment. As it reads, “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” The right is not ultimate, meaning that it is regulated by a number of firearms control rules (Legal Information Institute). But, in the majority of cases, if a person is mentally healthy, had no problems with the law, and has reached a certain age, there is nothing standing between them and the closest guns and ammo store.\n\nSecondly, there is a powerful group of lobbyists fiercely protecting the existing gun policies and struggling for their expansion–the National Rifle Association. Its attitude and motivation can be probably explained best by the words of its CEO Wayne LaPierre, spoken during one of the annual association’s conferences. He said, “There are terrorists and home invaders and drug cartels and carjackers and knockout gamers and rapers, haters, campus killers, airport killers … I ask you: do you trust the government to protect you? We are on our own … The things we care about most are changing … It’s why more and more Americans are buying firearms and ammunition” (The Guardian). The NRA constantly lobbies politicians who are proponents of looser gun policies, and their influence is incredibly strong. Moreover, when a CEO of such a renowned and authoritative organization makes claims that the best way of protecting oneself from the dangers of the modern world is weapons, it can have its consequences. Everyone has their own understanding of what “dangerous” means.\n\nAny system, even the most advanced one, has its flaws. Representative democracy, while being probably the most optimal form of government available nowadays, is imperfect, and does not guarantee effective solutions to the problems a state faces. Capitalism, while encouraging competition and thus making progress to move forward, is in many ways an inhumane and ruthless form of organizing economic relationships within a society. A right to bear arms, while theoretically providing effective means of self-defense and ensuring one’s security, fails to guarantee safety in reality.\n\nOf course, people purchasing weapons are supposed to undergo background checks–procedures ensuring they can be allowed to own firearms. Today, in order to buy a gun, a person needs to have no criminal records, mental illnesses, or a history of illegal drug abuse. If a person served in the army and left it because of dishonorable discharge, he or she cannot own weapons as well. Those who want to buy firearms must also be living on the territory of the United States legally, and have no restraint orders keeping them away from partners or children (The New York Times).\n\nHowever, in practice, it turns out that the system does not work as intended. Gun-controlling initiatives currently existing in the United States fail to fully ensure that a person purchasing a gun can be trusted with it. For example, a mass shooting in South Carolina in 2015, committed by a white racist in a church attended mostly by black visitors, could have been prevented. Due to the imperfections in the background checking system, not all of the information about the attacker could be retrieved in time (he had been arrested for using illegal drugs), and so he was able to buy a gun (The Guardian).\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the gun control initiative supported by Donald Trump’s administration do not “change the categories of who is barred from buying a gun, or even require all gun buyers to pass a background check before they can purchase a firearm […] Instead, it simply provides federal agencies with a few more incentives to submit records to the background check system – something they are already required by law to do.”\n (The Guardian).\n\nAlso, there are several loopholes allowing to bypass background checks. Some of these loopholes are the size of a massive black hole, figuratively speaking. One of them is the “gun show loophole.” In the United States, only licensed gun dealers are required to perform background checks. This rule, however, does not apply to small-scale vendors, who do business at gun shows. For some reason, the law does not make them check their clientele for unsightly biographical facts.\n\nAs for mental illnesses, the situation is not that simple as well. Those who knew people who committed mass shootings recognized them as untrustworthy and disturbed, or even knew about their mental illnesses. So, how could they buy weapon? The law states that a person who is “mentally defective” cannot own firearms; however, in reality, such a formulation is almost never used. Such a status, even if given to a mentally unhealthy patient, is often successfully reversed through court (The New York Times).\n\nThe situation with gun control currently existing in the United States probably cannot be called normal. On one side, the right to bear firearms and to protect one’s life with its help is guaranteed to American citizens by the Constitution. There are numerous laws and rules regulating the procedures of gun purchase. On the other hand, the system is imperfect, and rather often firearms can be purchased even by drug addicts or mentally unstable individuals. It might have been easier to simply ban guns from legal purchase, and there are many proponents of such measures. However, there are also many powerful lobbyists such as the National Rifle Association who do not agree with the idea of guns being prohibited. Most likely, the debate around this problem–as well as its direct outcomes such as mass shootings–will continue.###"}
{"prompt":"How does humor help reduce stress?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Stress is said to be an epidemic in the modern era. This is probably the case because of our constant work, our deadlines, our troublesome family life, and more. Not only is stress pervasive, but it deals significant damage to us. But apparently, there is a simple solution to stress: laughing and\/or enjoying humor. It is a natural method that can be used in almost any environment and almost at any time. Maintaining a sense of humor is one of the most essential factors in driving out stress. Humor allows us to reduce physical, mental, and psychological stress, to view situations from a different angle, and to increase our social interaction.\n\nCommonly, an individual’s body is tense from stress. This is just a usual fact of modern life. According to Marcus Clarke BSc, MSc, “Humour affects the autonomic nervous system by encouraging laughter which causes the body to slip into deeper breathing. This in turn relaxes the body’s muscles and calms the sympathetic nervous system from the adrenalized ‘fight or flight’ response to the more sedate parasympathetic nervous system driven state of calm. Thus, humour physically relaxes away stress and anxiety” (Psychology of Humor). When the body is more relaxed, one’s mental state is also improved. So, humor can have an overall effect on the relaxation of an individual.\n\nProblems can loom large in our minds if we perceive them as a dreadful. In this sense, we can say that mostly issues are developed mentally. However, with humor, we can see situations in a different light. According to broadcaster Allen Klein, “When we can find some humor in our upsets, they no longer seem as large or as important as they once did. Humor expands our limited picture frame and gets us to see more than just our problem. A sense of humor provides a new perspective on our situation” (The Perspective of Humor). As the saying goes, “attitude is everything.” If we change how we perceive problems with humor, the issues can disappear on their own.\n\nGroup laughter is an instance not to be missed. Many people feel that the best times in life is enjoying the company of friends, especially in laughter. According PsychAlive, “Dr. Dunbar describes social laughter as “grooming from a distance,” an activity that fosters closeness in a group the way one-way grooming, patting, and delousing promote and maintain bonds between individual primates of all kinds. Laughter contributes to group bonding, and may have been an important part in the evolution of highly social animals” (PsychAlive). So, in a sense, laughter might have been a way for us to develop from our distant primate cousins, and to engender a new type of social health.\n\nBut how do we maintain our sense of humor in such tense times? Based on the website Very Well Mind, we can start with these elements of our lives: smiling more often, taking time out during difficult situations, valuing extremes, having a funny friend, making stressful situations into a game, reading comedic books, joining clubs dedicated to humor, and finding common ground for laughter among friends (Scott, Elizabeth). There are many activities we can do to sustain our sense of humor, but these are the most common. Another such method is meditation. In meditation, we often find a distance between us and our stress, and the distance can create a greater sense of humor within us.\nStress is a malady of the modern world that must be dealt with in order for us to be in balance. Humor has been proposed as an effective remedy to stress, as it reduces physical and mental tension, allows us to have a positive perspective on difficult times, and ignites social activity that can make us feel more at peace. Humor is a free resource against stress that everyone should wield.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the traditional and modern roles of men?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In this modern era, the roles of particular genders are getting muddier and muddier. Defined roles for men and women are now becoming blurred. Sometimes, it is said there are no longer roles for genders. But, in this essay, we will not discuss how or why the role of men has been obscured. Rather, let us explore the traditional and modern role of men in all its vital aspects.\n\nTraditionally, men had these roles: a protector, a leader, a teacher, and a provider (The Good Men Project). Unfortunately, being a father figure was not so much into the equation of being a man. The women of the household were seen as more able and more responsible for children than men were. As long as the man could provide and protect his family, he was seen as a man. However, the man in the past did involve his sons and daughters in work, and taught them how to complete menial tasks. A man was also supposed to be confident in himself and be able to lead. This was also considered to be liked by women, and what attracted women to men. Having an air of determination, self esteem, and surety magnetized women towards them, supposedly.\n\nIn this modern era, men have taken more of an active role in family life, health, and providing emotional support. According to the Good Men Project, “Our modern society gives men a chance to be much more connected with their families and women are, finally, getting an opportunity to develop identities that are not defined solely by motherhood. Still, a lot of women prefer a man to play the role of a leader” (Olson, Alicia). In addition, modern men should not be ashamed, bitter, rigid, or emasculated. However, this does not mean men should shy away from emotions. They should, in fact, be masters of emotions. Sentiment needs to be weighed with logic and common sense. So, modern men are not devoid of their masculinity, but must be sympathetic, compassionate, and flexible in thinking. Apparently, the age of the stoic man has ended (Elephant Journal).\n\nBut what does this mean for you? How do you decide to take up the traditional or modern idea of being a man? If you are a husband, it often depends on what your wife expects of you, and what you expect of yourself. Often, men learn their roles from their fathers, or from father figures. And sadly, fathers have changed a lot in their roles recently. According to Family Education, “In generations past, sons expected to follow in their fathers’ footsteps, apprenticing in their work and in their approach to life. During the nineteenth century, however, fathers began to go out to work, and the measure of a man’s success slowly changed. Rather than the closeness of his family and the strength of his family business, a man’s worth could be measured in his income, the value of his house, and the size of his car. Parenting became “women’s work”; fathers were just too busy earning a living. And generations of boys grew up hungering for closeness with a father they barely knew, someone who came home only to eat dinner, look over homework, hear about the day’s misbehavior, and watch a little television” (“What Boys Learn from Their Dads”). This means that men are often torn between success at work and success at home. The point is finding the balance between the two, and not neglecting either. To add, Family Education found that, “fathers are just as good at reading a baby’s emotional cues as mothers are, but they respond in different ways. A father’s active play and stimulation may actually help a baby learn to be aware of his own internal state and to tolerate a wide range of people and activities” (“What Boys Learn from Their Dads”). This means that men should not forsake their emotional intelligence, but use it as women do to raise their children properly.\n\nIn this day and age, the roles of men are wide open. It is up to your choosing what being a man means. This is exciting and anxiety-inducing at the same time. With confidence in yourself, you can wade through this conundrum.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the technical details of Mars?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Mars is featured in countless science-fiction books, non-fiction books, cartoons, films, and more. However, how much do we know about the Red Planet? I would say that the average person only has a cursory knowledge of this important part of our solar system. Therefore, I will do justice to this planet by providing details about it so that the mystery of Mars can be deshrouded. I will go over its technical information, such as its general description, internal structure, surface geology, soil, hydrology, geography, atmosphere, climate, orbit, and habitability.\n\nMars is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is also the second-smallest planet in our solar system. By diameter, Mars is half as small as Earth, and is also less dense than Earth (Williams, David R.). Mars is named after the Roman god of war, and is often called the “Red Planet” (Zubrin, Robert; Wagner, Richard ).\n\nSimilar to Earth, Mars has a dense metallic core with less dense material surrounding it (Nimmo, Francis; Tanaka, Ken). Its core has a radius of approximately 1,794 ± 65 kilometers (1,115 ± 40 mi), mostly comprising of iron and nickel, with a bit of sulfur (Rivoldini, A., et al.). By estimates, the core is about twice as rich in lighter material than Earth (Jacqué, Dave). Though dormant, there is a silicate mantle that overlays the core, which created the tectonic plates on the planet.\n\nThe surface geology of Mars is similar to Earth, with some nuances. Like Earth, Mars is a terrestrial planet, meaning that its surface is mostly composed of minerals, oxygen, metals and other substances that comprise rock. The main material the surface of Mars is made of is  tholeiitic basalt (McSween, Harry Y, et al.), and most of the surface is covered in granulated iron oxide dust (Christensen, Philip R.,et al.).\n\nMartian soil is slightly alkaline and has traces of magnesium, sodium, potassium, and chlorine. These are elements found on Earth and are employed for the growth of vegetation (BBC News). In addition, the soil on Mars has a pH of 7.7, and has 0.6% of salt perchlorate (Chang, Alicia).\n\nBecause of atmospheric pressure, unfortunately liquid water cannot exist on the Red Planet (NASA). There are two polar ice caps on Mars, which are mostly composed of water. Ice water is hypothesized to be trapped within the cryosphere of the planet (ESA). However, there is evidence that liquid water once existed on Mars, and that there could be liquid water in the future (“Mineral in Mars ‘Berries’ Adds to Water Story”).\n\nIn 1810, the first maps of Mars’ geography was made by Johann Heinrich Mädler, which synthesized ten years of observations. The markings on the original map were only single letters as abbreviations for full names (Sheehan, William). Currently, many languages and names accompany maps of Mars, with the general features of Mars described by classical mythology, craters being named after deceased scientists, and even towns and cities. Valleys are either named after “Mars” or “star” in numerous languages, or named after rivers (Planetary Names).\n\nLet us look into its atmosphere. Approximately, four billion years ago, Mars lost its magnetosphere most likely because of asteroid strikes (Wired). Due to this, solar winds directly influence the planet’s ionosphere, which lowers atmospheric density. In terms of percentages, 96% of it is carbon dioxide, 1.9% argon, 1.8% nitrogen, with very little oxygen and water (Williams, David R.).\n\nMars is often called a sister planet to Earth because of its climate, which has Earth-like seasons. This similarity is due to the tilts of both planets on their rotational axes. However, the lengths of the seasons on Mars are twice as long, because Mars is a greater distance from the Sun than Earth. Though Mars has extreme low temperatures, it has also has a degree of comfortable temperatures for human life. However, Mars has the largest dust storms in the galaxy, so living on Mars would not be that easy (Discover Magazine).\n\nThe Red Planet has a strange orbit. According to Universe Today, “Mars’ average distance (semi-major axis) from the Sun is 227,939,200 km (141,634,852.46 mi) which is roughly one and half times the distance between Earth and the Sun (1.52 AU). Compared to Earth, its orbit is also rather eccentric (0.0934 vs. 0.0167), ranging from 206.7 million km (128,437,425.435 mi; 1.3814 AU) at perihelion to 249.2 million km (154,845,701 mi; 1.666 AU) at aphelion. At this distance, and with an orbital speed of 24.077 km\/s, Mars takes 686.971 Earth days, the equivalent of 1.88 Earth years, to complete a orbit around the Sun” (“The Orbit of Mars. How Long Is a Year on Mars?”). This makes Mars difficult to monitor in terms of its orbit.\n\nThe most pressing question about Mars is whether or not it is habitable. According to The Planetary Society, “Long-term habitation on Mars will require us to master the conversion of raw Martian materials into resources we can use to survive. Fortunately, Mars has a wealth of these materials, making it arguably the most human-habitable place in the solar system, other than the Earth itself” (The Planetary Society Blog). The aspects of Mars that seems appealing to scientists in terms of its habitability is “atmospheric CO2, atmospheric N2 and argon, H2O from the atmosphere and polar ice, perchlorates in the regolith, nitrates in the regolith, basaltic rocks, and fluorine” (The Planetary Society Blog).\n\nWith this technical information in mind, we can see Mars with a much clearer mind. We can understand why Mars is favored as the next place for humans to live: it has similar seasons, it has an untapped potential in the form of ice water, and with the right technology, we can live there unperturbed. Within the next 50 years, it may be possible that the first colonies on the Red Planet will crop up.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the main reasons for wars?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Wars have gone on since the dawn of time, it seems. They are terrible and catastrophic, yet we seem to not know how to stop them from happening. As people who have witnessed worldwide wars for maybe our entire lives, it is good to introspect about the reasons behind wars. Wars are not always conducted because of anger, jealousy, resentment, or hate. There is a so-called “just war.” For instance, the United States Marines delineate these reason for war: “Immediate defense of the nation (response to an attack) 2) Control of raw materials 3) Control of means of production 4) Control of trade routes 5) Control of trade profits 6) Treaty obligations involving the above in the nation’s best interests” (The Economist). We will go into detail about these causes in the following paragraphs.\n\nDefending one’s nation from invasion is the most honorable and moral reason for war, by most standards. A nation retaliating against an attack on its people and national borders is protecting its citizens and national identity. There is an innocence in being a victim and hitting back at those who have harmed you. Though the Christian doctrine relies on forgiveness, and most western countries engaged in wars are “Christian nations,” fighting back against an invasion or direct attack on a nation is seen as the most just form of war (BBC).\n\nGaining and\/or maintaining control over raw materials is another key reason for wars to be started and sustained. As the website Modern Diplomacy states, “The war for raw materials amounts to a reshuffling of the power relations among Western nations, on one hand, and the emerging and\/or developing nations, on the other. The rise of China, BRICS, and the growing strength of the sovereign wealth funds of Arab nations, which are oil exporters, provides the evidence. Resources are powerful weapons in economic warfare, and everything suggests that the conflict will only intensify. The International Energy Agency estimates that world demand for energy will increase by 50% from now until 2030, especially owing to the growth of India and China” (Giuseppe, Gagliano). Some people say that most wars are fought over raw materials, as they make a nation strong and sustainable.\n\nRelating to engaging in war over raw materials, controlling the means of production is also on top of the list. The production of materials is especially important for a country’s economy, and acts against a nation’s production of materials can be seen as an engagement of war. Therefore, many nations, when faced with a serious threat to their economy through an offensive on their means of production, engage in war.\n\nAnother economic reason, the control of trade routes, is a more traditional reason to conduct a war. Trade routes have been versatile and flexible since the age of the Internet, though most of the trade of the world is still done by ship (United Nations). Therefore, the control of trade routes by sea is still essential. However, much trade that is not dealing with raw materials can be sent through the Internet. If a country cuts off the trade routes of another country, the victimized country is liable to counter this action.\n\nAs you might have noticed, there has been a pattern of economic advantages or disadvantages, and engaging in war based on these premises. Yet another economic reason to start a war is the control of trade profits. War can increase trade with another allied nation, or it can combat the decrease, or impending decrease, in trade profits. Suffering economically can mean the eventual death of a nation, so it is fair to go to war for economic reasons.\n\nFinally, moving away from economic reasons, wars also happen due to obligations to treaties. The first and second world wars can be said to be treaty-based wars, for example. These treaties are a sign of ideological relationships between countries and protecting their interests. Countries make treaties for several reasons, but one of them is the protection of countries’ borders by military force.\n\nAs it can be seen, war is usually tied to economic, ideological, and nationalistic concepts. A “just war” is not based on emotions, but rather on keeping the prosperity of said countries. With all these reasons for war, it looks like there is no reason for wars to end in the coming century.###"}
{"prompt":"How do reality shows affect teenagers and children?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is probably impossible to find a person living in a developed country that would not have heard about reality shows. A relatively new genre of entertaining production, reality television quickly gained popularity among all audiences, becoming one of the most demanded-for and lucrative niches in mass media. It creates extremely appealing, sometimes even addictive content. This would be fine if its audience consisted entirely of adults: grown-up people usually have established behavioral models, shaped outlooks, and tend to view reality TV content as mere entertainment. At the same time, a large percentage of viewers are teenagers or even children–and in this case, the worldwide popularity of reality shows may be not so harmless after all.\n\nAlthough its emergence and development is usually associated with late 1990s and youth-oriented channels such as MTV, the history of reality television goes a little back further in time. It all started in the 1970s with the show called “An American Family” released on air (ANVC). A series of documentaries depicting mundane and sometimes dramatic events in the lives of a regular Californian family captivated the minds and hearts of millions of Americans, paving the way for hundreds of the show’s ideological successors.\n\nThe idea of a reality show is somewhat voyeuristic: a group of “real people” allows cameramen, directors, and other TV staff into their homes or other everyday environments, and lets them broadcast their lives on television. To make these shows more interactive, producers often initiate all kinds of voting–for example, when the audience decides the fate of the show’s participants via online polls or phone calls.\n\nRather often, even adult viewers rarely contemplate the possibility that the people they watch are actors, that they follow a script, and that the plot and dynamics of the show often reflects the demands and expectations of the target audience (Screenrant). In the case of teenagers, they tend to see behavioral patterns and relationship models depicted in their favorite shows as exemplary, especially if there are celebrities involved–and this is just one of the numerous problems. In particular, reality television often shows excessive amounts of aggression; this is needed mostly to keep the audience “on their toes,” making them guess about the outcomes of numerous fomented interpersonal conflicts.\n\nFor example, shows aimed at female audiences may promote gossiping, condescendence, and bullying as a part of “normal” women’s behavior (The MGH Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds). Shows directed for men can do the same, encouraging the usage of aggression or even violence as a mean of solving interpersonal conflicts and\/or relationship problems. Jealousy, inadequacy, intrigues, gossips, and verbal and emotional abuse are often fake in the case of reality shows, and are meant to attract and thrill audiences. However, teenagers may see it as real, adopting and reproducing these behavioral patterns in real life. And, considering how much time a regular American teenager spends watching television, this fact is alarming.\n\nAn even more disturbing effect reality shows may have on teenagers is early sexual activity and substance use. “Sex sells” is a formula too efficient to be neglected in show business. A vast amount of television products promote or depict sex one way or another. Reality shows are no exception from this rule; it is not uncommon to see sexually-suggestive or explicit content in such reality shows as “Ex on the Beach” or “Big Brother.” At the same time, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, teenage girls viewing such reality shows tend to view physical attractiveness and sexual appeal as criteria for success in real life, or even means of reaching it. There are also reports proving that teenage girls watching shows with sexual content are more likely to get pregnant at an early age. Moreover, many shows depict people under the influence of alcohol behaving inadequately. Some studies assume that teenagers viewing such content may feel like it is safe for them to consume alcohol at a young age, or that they cannot be held accountable for their behaviors when drunk (Livestrong). These two factors combined generate an explosive mixture, adding up to regular teenage hormonal storms: needless to say, it can make unpredictable adolescent behaviors even more rebellious.\n\nIn the case of some reality shows, children and teenagers can be not only viewers, but also participants. This is mostly true for all kinds of talent shows focusing on children’s extraordinary talents or abilities. Although it can be considered relatively harmless and many parents enjoy watching such shows together with their kids, there may be negative psychological effects here as well. In particular, according to Arundhati Swamy, a family counselor and parenting expert, such shows may draw parents to a belief that their children must also exceptional and talented in some area. It is alright if a child indeed has a talent, and his or her parents do not try to benefit from it. However, children who are so far not extraordinary in any way may start experiencing lower self-esteem, comparing themselves to the participants of TV shows. Or, parents may start putting emotional pressure on their children because of this–and the attempts to adapt to excessively high expectations can have a number of adverse effects on a child (Parent Circle).\n\nOverall, it can be said that reality shows are not affecting teenagers and children positively. Whereas adults with shaped outlooks and behavioral patterns often view such shows as entertainment and do not seem to be affected by them significantly, teenagers may adopt inappropriate behavioral patterns seen on television. Such patterns include aggression and bullying, early sexual activity, and substance use. Therefore, it is advisable that teenagers watch reality shows under their parents’ control, or do not watch them at all.###"}
{"prompt":"How did the domestication of animals occur?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Humans and pets have had a long history together. Through a symbiotic relationship with animals, we have evolved together throughout eons. The domestication of animals occurred because of the mutual benefit humans and animals saw in interacting with each other. Though humans are said to make conscious choices, animals still reacted in ways that corresponded to their advancement, whether that was being fed regularly, being protected, or being companions. Let us explore the history of pets to comprehend how human and animal interaction became gradually more symbiotic.\n\nThe extant gray wolf was a wild and fierce pack animal, but somehow, humans tamed it. How did this happen? There are many theories, as the genetic material has been mixed between dogs and wolves, plus the evolution of dogs have not been entirely linear (Larson G., Bradley D.G.). However, it is generally agreed that about 15,000 years or even longer ago, humans and gray wolves began hunting together, and to build a symbiotic relationship. The wolves and humans would help kill off prey and they would both share in the spoils of their hunting. Of course, there was not an instant relationship between them, but trust was eventually built between the two species (Larson G.).\n\nIt is uncertain whether the domestication of wolves, eventually becoming dogs through generations, was done on the behalf of humans or wolves. But what is certain is that eventually, the tamer wolves stayed more with humans, and started to breed with other tame wolves. These tame wolves bred wolves with different characteristic based on their genetic makeup. The anomalies were subtle at first, but ultimately grew more distinct from their ancestors—the usually fierce extant gray wolf. Different colors, curled tails, and the like began to appear with selective breeding (Science Focus).\n\nOver the centuries, from this taming of wolves came breeds that focused on certain characteristics and functions. For instance, the oldest living breed of dog is the basenji, which is featured in sculptures and tombs of ancient Egypt (IHeartDogs.com). And according to Dogtime.com, “He uses both scent and sight to hunt and was originally used to flush small game into a hunter’s nets and to control village rodent populations. Clever and endearing, he’s a good companion for the person or family who can stay a step ahead of him” (Dogtime). But dogs were ultimately used for more than hunting partners. They became companions, war tools, assistants for disabled people, drug finders, babysitters, and more. Though the initial evolution of extant gray wolf into dog is unclear in its circumstances, it is understood that humans have done intentional breeding of certain types of dogs to fit their needs (Bennett, Jacqueline, et al).\n\nModern pet keeping began in Britain in the seventeenth century, the Victorian Era. Aristocrats were the first to keep them continuously as companions and hunters, so owning a pet was a sign of elitism. This is not to say that before dogs were not kept as pets, but it was first in the Victorian Era that we saw dogs living in human residences most of the day. However, in the nineteenth century, the middle class grew, and with it, dogs as pets became common within middle class households as well. From this time, the practice of dogs being kept in normal households gradually spread worldwide (Amato, Sarah).\n\nDogs are now an integral part of human society, whether we admit it or not. From the dangerous extant gray wolf of ancient history, these creatures eventually joined humans in a symbiotic relationship that fostered a new evolutionary branch for both species. Now, we even have dog whispers, dog trainers, and dog psychologists, while dogs innately understand us through genetics. It looks like our evolution together continues in earnest.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the history of Pepsi?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Pepsi is a favored soda drink across the world, but it is also a multinational company known as PepsiCo that sells a variety of products. Though not as popular as Coca-Cola, Pepsi is still beloved by countless people. Most people drink Pepsi without looking at what is inside it, or knowing its history. In order to discover a piece of popular culture, this essay will delve into the history of Pepsi from its very beginning.\n\nThis famous soda drink was not always called “Pepsi,” as initially, it was named “Brad’s Drink” (The History of the Birthplace of Pepsi-Cola). The creator of “Brad’s Drink” was Caleb Bradham from New Bern, North Carolina. Bradham began selling his concoction at the drugstore he worked at in 1893. By 1898, it was no longer “Brad’s Drink” but “Pepsi-Cola” based on the ingredient kola nuts and the word “dyspepsia” which means indigestion. The original Pepsi-Cola also had vanilla and sugar (Soda Museum). The creation of the drink was made to help out with digestion and give energy (The History of the Birthplace of Pepsi-Cola).\n\nIn 1903, Bradham got more serious about his drink. He moved the production of his “Pepsi-Cola” to a warehouse. Initially, Bradham sold the syrup to people. In his first year of warehouse production, Bradham sold 7,968 gallons of syrup. In the following year, with so many gallons already sold, Bradham changed tactics and put out Pepsi-Cola in six-ounce bottles. It proved to be worth the change, and 19,848 gallons of the drink were sold that year. In 1909, Pepsi-Cola got its first endorsement by a celebrity. Famous automobile racer Barney Oldfield advertised Pepsi-Cola as a great drink to have before a race (Timetoast).\n\nFor two decades, the advertising theme for Pepsi-Cola was “Delicious and Healthful.” Up until 1931, in the Great depression, the drink sold well and consistently. But in light of the Great Depression, the company filed for bankruptcy. The explanation is that the sugar prices fluctuated during this time. Eventually, Roy C. Megargel purchased Pepsi’s trademark. Yet, Megargel soon had to give up his efforts, since his business practices were unsuccessful. President of Loft, Inc., Charles Guth, took the mantle instead. A candy manufacturer, Loft was using Coke soda fountains, but needed a substitute, as Coke would not provide a discount during the Great Depression. Therefore, Pepsi-Cola was employed in place of Coke, but with a changed formula (Soda Museum).###"}
{"prompt":"What are the potential uses for virtual reality?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is probably difficult to find a person in a developed country who has not heard of virtual reality. First depicted in dystopian science-fiction movies of the 1980s, it quickly became more than just a concept or a science-fiction setting. Today, we speak of virtual reality as something already invented, familiar, and even mundane. Devices such as Oculus Rift or Samsung Gear are sold everywhere, and they are not even that expensive. Different companies and websites have started offering at least some of their services in virtual or augmented reality. VR and AR are being actively explored by advertising and marketing agencies. In other words, from terra incognita, virtual reality has quickly turned into a newly-conquered land which requires development. Let us take a closer look at the ways virtual reality can be of service nowadays.\n\nObviously, gaming and entertainment were among the first industries to adopt virtual reality. A number of companies started developing video games, movies, and other digital content almost immediately after the technology became available. With the help of special VR gear, a user can submerge into a realistic experience, which is entirely fictional. For example, a well-known space simulator “Elite: Dangerous” allows players to test themselves as pilots of a spacecraft, exploring a vast universe, participating in space battles, trading, and interacting with thousands of other players. VR gear provides an extremely-immersive simulation, making a gamer “see” the world of the game not on screen, but with his or her own eyes, getting “inside” of it. Games such as “Subnautica,” “Farpoint,” “ADR1FT,” and many others do the same: offering gamers a paradox of facing realistic situations never possible in real life (Techradar). The same applies to cinema, theater, and other forms of entertainment: each user gains access to their own personal theater, a huge virtual screen; or, even better, a user may find themselves surrounded by the events going on in a movie or play by its sounds, visual effects, and actors (Livescience). Undoubtedly, virtual reality is capable of eclipsing all the previously-known forms of media entertainment with ease.\n\nThere are, however, more serious and beneficial applications of this amazing technology. In particular, healthcare and medicine are the two fields that supposedly benefit from the invention of virtual reality the most. To start with, VR technology allows creating realistic simulations of the human body, with all of its internal organs, tissues, and fluids: there are software developers such as Conquer Mobile and Surgical Theater who specialize in creating extremely credible and realistic 3D models using real medical data (Livescience). These simulations can be used by both medical students during the course of their studying, and professors willing to practice difficult surgical procedures prior to real operations. In addition, VR technologies can be used to cure not only the body, but to alleviate the mind as well. It is well known that people who witnessed or participated in extremely stressful events often fall victim to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The most common risk groups are soldiers, policemen, and people living in conflict zones. Usually, recovering from PTSD involves a patient’s direct participation; through the careful recalling of traumatizing events and\/or feelings under the supervision of a psychologist, a patient gradually learns to substitute them with more positive ones. VR technologies can be effectively used for both of these purposes. Since it is controllable and safe, a patient with PTSD may feel safer when engaging in treatment. Besides, unlike imagination and\/or memories, virtual reality feels more real, so the effects of treatment can also manifest themselves faster (Technobyte).\n\nAnother surprising application for VR technology is city building and architecture. Usually, it takes plenty of time to design, draw, and render a model of a building, let alone test it for convenience, or check out how it would fit into the surrounding cityscape and infrastructure. Virtual reality allows architects to design city environments faster, and test them prior to construction. For example, it becomes possible to test a projected building on fire safety, simulating the speed and ease (or complexity) with which people inside it can exit in case of an emergency (Entrepreneur).\n\nSightseeing, exploring the cultural heritage of different countries, virtual tourism, and even visiting museums become possible with virtual reality as well. Nowadays, everyone has already got used to panoramic and 360 photographs from Google Earth and elsewhere. The next step, logically, would be to recreate areas of historical or cultural interest, for instance. Instead of looking at a photo of the Acropolis, one could be standing right in front of it—all due to VR gear and special software. Visiting museums and getting oneself introduced to the famous artistic masterpieces is yet another possibility to explore. A number of important museums already offer virtual tours. For example, in 2015 the British Museum in London opened its first virtual exhibition, and the American Museum of Natural History in New York shared some of its collections with everyone interested in it via Google Cardboards. These are just the first steps, but undoubtedly, with each year, more and more possibilities for virtual tourism and sightseeing will become available for the users of VR gear (Livescience).\n\nArt is obviously a field in which the possibilities virtual reality grants can be applied fully. Contemporary artists have quickly embraced VR as a new dimension for the embodiment of their ideas, and started constructing all kinds of experiences, impossible to recreate by conventional means such as oil. 3D sculptures created from colorful light, surreal fusions of sounds and images, new peculiar environments to explore—these are just some of the examples of artwork possible to create in VR. One of the most complex pieces was created by an artistic duo from Belgium; it is called STYX, and it recreates the experience of swimming down the great river of the dead from Greek mythology. The artists went as far as simulating the sensations of wind and touch (Technobyte). In other words, the potential of VR technology for art is great.\n\nAs it can be seen, virtual reality is not meant just for gaming. Although the entertainment industry was among the first to start exploiting the potential of this new technology, there are other fields in which VR can become extremely useful. For example, it can be used in medicine to recreate real-life surgical experiences for students and doctors, or to help during the treatment of psychological disorders such as PTSD. VR can be employed in architecture to design city environments faster and more effectively. It can also be used for the purposes of sightseeing and tourism, and many contemporary artists nowadays use it as a new dimension to create artwork in. Generally speaking, virtual reality is a prospective and promising technology, the potential use of which is yet to be explored.###"}
{"prompt":"How did the television develop?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The television has been a cornerstone of entertainment, information, education, and more for generations. Most people, though, do not stop to think about how it developed into what it is now, or how it works. Much like its collective use, the making of the television was a worldwide effort of many individuals who strove to push technology further. Let us take a glimpse into the history of television.\n\nThe beginning of television starts with facsimile transmission systems, or fax machines in the early 19th century. Alexander Bain, a Scottish inventor, developed this machine around 1843, but it was not until 1851 that the English physicist Frederick Bakewell made a working laboratory version of one. By 1856, these machines that mechanically scanned graphics worked on telegraph lines (Fax Authority).\n\nIn 1873, the photoconductivity of the element selenium was found out by English electrical engineer Willoughby Smith (Biography of Willoughby Smith). This led to more findings in conveying images through mechanical means. Particularly, the Nipkow disk, patented in 1884 by German student Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow, was a spinning disk with holes in it that scanned the lines of an image (Shiers, George and May). Once introduced, different versions on the device were created with enthusiasm from inventors and scientists.\n\nAt the Electricity Congress at the International World Fair in Paris on August 24, 1900, the term “television” was coined in a paper read by Constantin Dmitrievich Perskyi, a Russian scientist. Though there were no working designs of these image scanners at this time, Perskyi reviewed the electromechanical technologies that were present (Television History – The First 75 Years).\n\nIn 1907, with the progress of amplification tube technology, these electromechanical devices became practical (The New York Times). In Paris in 1909, the initial demonstration of the instantaneous transmission of images was completed by Georges Rignoux and A. Fournier. Based on an illustration by Henry de Varigny, we know that the device was a matrix of 64 selenium cells within a mechanical commutator, which was akin to a retina. In terms of the receiver, a Kerr cell changed the light and a series of mirrors fitted to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the beam onto the screen. A circuit looked after synchronization, and the 8×8 pixel resolution was enough to transmit letters of the alphabet. An updated image was sent a few times each second (Henry de Varigny).\n\nFollowing this achievement, in 1911, Russians Boris Rosing and Vladimir Zworykin employed a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to send images over wires through a tube into a receiver. Though the images were sent, the images could not move due to the lack of sensitivity in the selenium cells that were used (R.W. Burns). However, in the early 1920s, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird worked on a prototype with the help of the Nipkow disk. During this time, he not only was working on his video system, but on adding color to the transmitted images as well. On March 25, 1925, Baird gave what is known as the first public demonstration of moving televised silhouette images at Selfridge’s Department Store in London. And according Biography.com, “In 1927 Baird transmitted sound and images over more than 400 miles of telephone wire from London to Glasgow, and in 1928 he sent the first television transmission across the Atlantic Ocean from London to New York. Beginning in 1929, the BBC used Baird’s technology to broadcast its earliest television programming” (“John Logie Baird”). Though Baird made claim to the first recognized public broadcast of television, the mechanical nature of his invention soon seemed inferior to electronic models that were soon to come.\n\nTransmitting images, even mechanically, has never been an easy feat. Throughout the 19th century to the present, we have been developing the science behind transmitting moving images onto a screen known as a television set. The next development in these arena is virtual reality, but that is another tale for another day.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the reasons people become racist?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Racism is common in every country of the world, even if those countries’ governments are not willing to admit it. It is known that racism is a nurtured quality rather than an inherent property of people. Therefore, it is intriguing to investigate why people become racist or have racist tendencies. Racism usually stems from fear, a desire to be a part of group, and one’s upbringing.\n\nSometimes, racism appears due to a fear of the unknown. Many people are racist towards African-Americans because they have not met any, or have not gotten close to any in terms of a friendship. A Caucasian person might go through his or her whole life without becoming friends with an African-American, and thus, they believe what is said negatively about this group of people on the news and from other sources. According to the results of a study by New York University and Harvard University, “although racial prejudice is learnt, everybody has an inbuilt inclination towards learning to fear people who appear different. If a white person is robbed by a white mugger, for example, he will not readily develop an instinctive fear of other white people. If his assailant is black, however, he is more likely to become wary of black people in general. The effect can be broken down by positive exposure to people of different races. Both white and black people who have dated people from other ethnic groups lose their predisposition to learn to fear them, research showed” (Henderson, Mark). So, though fear of other racial groups can be developed, it can also be undone through building relationships with those factions of people.\n\nEach person desires to be included in a group of sorts. Often, within these groups, certain people are perceived as “good” or “bad,” or different epithets. Those who are inside the group are seen as friends, and sometimes those outside the group are perceived as enemies. Dr. John Paul Garrison explains that, “The us-versus-them mentality makes them feel closer to the group they identify with, which provides social support. That is a severely perverted version of healthy social support, but the longing to identify with and be close to others is a healthy desire” (Abrams, Allison). It sounds like an oxymoron, but hate is used to garner love in the case of racism.\n\nChildren repeat what their parents say and do, and the acquiring of racism is no different. Attitudes, the way people speak, what actions they take in certain circumstances, depend largely on what they were taught as a child. Of course, one can step away from these habits, but it is not so easy. Renowned Harvard University researcher Mahzarin Banaji has done studies on children and racism. He notes that, “where racism and other prejudice are concerned, is that we had far over-calculated how long it takes for these traits to become imbedded in a child’s brain. It’s quite shocking really, but the gist of it is that 3- and 4-year-olds demonstrate the same level and type of bias as adults. This tells us that children ‘get it’ very, very quickly, and that it doesn’t require a mature level of cognition to form negative biases” (The Boston Globe). Thus, children learn racism quicker than we might expect. As parents, we have to be careful what we say, and wary of who are children are around.\n\nRacism is an ancient phenomenon that is still prevalent, despite advances in rights, attitudes, and standards of living. This psychological disorder comes about commonly through the fear of people, a desire to be an integral part of a group, and from upbringing. Though many freedom fighters and activists have tried to conquer racism and to dispel it, it continues in the minds of people. The end of racism unfortunately does not seem to be a plausible occurence in our current world.###"}
{"prompt":"How can we achieve peace in our lives?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Pondering about peace in one’s life is not so easy. We have peaceful moments, but are we peaceful as a whole? Most people would say no. How do we garner peace in chaotic times and in a world bent on stress? There are a few actions we can take to be peaceful people: meditating regularly, taking walks in nature, and de-stressing our daily lives. There are many other ways, but I want to focus on these three, as I believe they are the most practical and easiest to accomplish.\n\nMeditation has been proven to alleviate stress, and bring people to mental silence. This mental silence is essential in our daily lives, as we easily become tired, distracted, and stressed from our constant thoughts. We need at least some time for our mind to be quiet and to relax. In fact, there have been thorough studies on meditation, especially Sahaja Yoga Meditation, alleviating anxiety and other forms of stress to a great degree. According to the website Researching Meditation, “In one of the most thoroughly designed studies of meditation ever published, full-time workers who used Sahaja Yoga meditation became much less stressed and depressed compared to more conventional approaches to relaxation or even placebo, according to a paper published this week in the online journal Evidence Based Complementary Medicine, a leading publication in its field” (Researching Meditation Sahaja Yoga Meditation Proven Highly Effective for Treatment of Stress and Depressive Mood). So, if we want to become peaceful people, meditating on a daily basis is a solid step in the right direction.\n\nWalking in nature, and walking in general, has been shown to increase peace of mind. According to Greater Good magazine, “It’s clear that hiking—and any physical activity—can reduce stress and anxiety. But, there’s something about being in nature that may augment those impacts. In one recent experiment conducted in Japan, participants were assigned to walk either in a forest or in an urban center (taking walks of equal length and difficulty) while having their heart rate variability, heart rate, and blood pressure measured. The participants also filled out questionnaires about their moods, stress levels, and other psychological measures. Results showed that those who walked in forests had significantly lower heart rates and higher heart rate variability (indicating more relaxation and less stress), and reported better moods and less anxiety, than those who walked in urban settings” (“How Nature Can Make You Kinder, Happier, and More Creative”). Walking in nature allows us to get in connection with our roots—no pun intended. When we distance ourselves from our natural surroundings, we become dissonant within—this is why it is refreshing and soothing to walk in nature.\n\nSometimes, people seem to collect negativity intentionally. The friends we choose to be around, the music we listen to, the TV shows we watch, and other activities we choose to add to our lives can bring us stress. Though peace ultimately comes from within, limiting negative external factors can be of benefit. Based on the article 11 Tips to De-Stress Your Life by Entrepreneur magazine, these elements provide an avenue for retaining peace: identifying triggers of stress, being healthy, getting organized, stopping procrastination, turning off your smartphone, doing what makes you happy, not filling up your calendar, accepting people as they are, being grateful, avoiding multitasking, and kissing regularly with a loved one (Rampton, John). Supposedly, with all these activities combined, inner and outer peace can be attained.\n\nAchieving peace in our lives often seems like a mystical concept, but it can be garnered through practical efforts. Meditating regularly, walking in nature, and finding ways to de-stress your life all come in handy. The point of peace is not to have only a few moments of serenity during a day, but to have a day perpetuated with tranquil moments. This can only arise when we have not only external peace, but peace within.###"}
{"prompt":"How did the game of tennis develop over time?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Tennis is one of the most popular racket sports, and tennis matches are avidly watched on TV by millions of viewers. It is an Olympic sport that is played in most countries in the world, by all ages and all sectors of society. Though the modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, the game has developed throughout many centuries. In the following paragraphs, we will explore the precursors and development of this beloved sport.\n\nThe origin of tennis may be connected to the 12th century game called jeu de paume (“game of the palm”) that came from northern France (Gillmeister, Heiner). It was popularized by Louis X of France, and he was the first person to build indoor tennis courts (Newman, Paul B.). His design for indoor courts gradually spread across Europe. In the first historical record of tennis, in June of 1316, Louis was playing a tennis game and drank a large quantity of cooled wine and later died. Because of this dramatic occurrence, tennis was first recorded (Gillmeister, Heiner). Following the death of Louis X, King Charles V of France was a noted enthusiast of the game, setting up a court in his Louvre Palace (J. Perris).\n\nIt is difficult to imagine, but tennis was being played with the palm of the hand until the 16th century, when rackets were introduced. When the game integrated rackets into its rules, the game changed its name to tennis from the French word tenez. This word was employed as an interjection to bring attention to the opponent by the server (Etymonline.com). In the 16th century, tennis was popular in England and France, but there was a rule at the time that you could hit the ball off the wall. It is said that Henry VIII of England was a huge fan of this game. The rules of keeping score, duration of the game, and more were different than modern tennis (Crego, Robert).\n\nHowever, in the 18th and the 19th centuries, this type of tennis declined, and many other racket sports emerged, taking more prominence. But, the modern game of tennis was slowly taking shape. In 1830, the first patented lawn mower was invented in Britain, and this happening made it much easier to construct lawn courts that would later be ideal for modern tennis. In turn, by 1872, the first tennis club was founded by Harry Gem and Augurio Perera in England (Tyzack, Anna) and in 1873, and a British officer, Major Walter Clopton Wingfield, patented a new game called “sticky” (E. M. Halliday). Most historians agree that Wingfield was responsible for developing the modern game of tennis by making his own rules, providing box sets of tennis equipment people could purchase, and marketing the game all over the world (CNN).\n\nBy 1874, Wingfield had sent thousands of tennis box sets to customers, and from this burst in sales came the first tennis championship called the Wimbledon Championships in 1877. For the Championship, much debate happened about how to standardize the rules of the game (CNN). In fact, in each club, tennis was played slightly differently, with varying rules, ball size, and more. By the early 1900s, however, clubs and championships cropped up in France, the US, Australia, and of course in Britain. The major championships played today—Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open, and the Australian Open—have been developed based on the centers where tennis first took hold most prominently (Tennis Server). Finally, in 1924, the standardized rules of tennis emerged from the efforts of the International Lawn Tennis Federation (later known as the International Tennis Federation).\n\nThough there are many other details I could add, I would not want to bore the reader. This is essentially the flow of the history of this royal game. Favored by kings in England and France, it is now a global phenomenon. Many factors have contributed to its success: the invention of machines to create proper lawns for the game, royal backing, and several key people wanting to develop standardized rules for the game and to market it as a sport for all. From its beginnings as a form of backyard amusement, it is currently the most respected racket game in the world.###"}
{"prompt":"How did J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit become a success?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The Hobbit, written by J.R.R. Tolkien, is a children’s fantasy novel (though the series The Lord of the Rings that followed its story was more tuned to adults) that was first published in 1937. When it was first released, it received critical acclaim from millions of readers, and it was eventually nominated for the Carnegie Medal and won “Best Juvenile Fiction” from the New York Herald Tribune. However, despite its success, the most enduring trait of the novel is its connection with readers throughout generations that has inspired countless authors and readers. Most people know the story of The Hobbit, so in this essay, we will explore the creation of this beloved literary work.\n\nTolkien was an academic, being a professor at Pembroke College at Oxford. In the early 1930s, his works mostly consisted of children’s literature, which included poetry, nursery rhymes, and other types of writing for young adults. At this time, he was even making his own elven language and mythology, which he had been developing since 1917 (Rateliff, John D.).\n\nAccording to a letter Tolkien sent to W.H. Auden in 1955, Tolkien began writing The Hobbit in the early 1930s while marking up papers by his students. He saw a blank page, and started to write, “In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.” He was greatly inspired to write the story, and the first manuscript of The Hobbit was finished in 1932 (Carpenter, Humphrey). He handed the manuscript to his friends, including C.S. Lewis and Elaine Griffiths, a student of his. Griffiths later was the catalyst for the publishing of The Hobbit. When a staff member of the publishing company George Allen & Unwin, Susan Dagnall, came to Oxford, Griffiths either lent the book to Dagnall or was suggested to borrow it from Tolkien. Dagnall enjoyed the novel, and handed over the manuscript to a 10-year-old boy to receive a child’s point of view. With a favorable review from the child, George Allen & Unwin agreed to publish The Hobbit (Carpenter, Humphrey).\n\nBefore getting into how the book became a success, let us look into Tolkien’s influences for the story. William Morris, who was a 19th-century English poet, translator, and creative genius, was a significant figure to Tolkien. In fact, Tolkien desired to write more in Morris’ romantic style. In particular, a chapter named The Desolation of Smaug was directly influenced by Morris’ style and ideas (The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien). Another writer that left an impression on Tolkien was Samuel Rutherford Crockett. His historical novel The Black Douglas and its villain Gilles de Retz inspired The Hobbit‘s evil character Sauron. It is said the narrative style and even the events in both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were influenced by The Black Douglas (Lobdell, Jared C.). The goblins within The Hobbit are closely associated with the goblins in the novel The Princess and the Goblin by George MacDonald. In addition, MacDonald impressed upon Tolkien the role of fantasy in the context of Christianity (J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment). Another key influence on The Hobbit is Tolkien’s adoration of Norse mythology and Germanic philology. Not only are many myths from Norse mythology adapted into The Hobbit, the names of the characters have a distinct Old Norse feel to them (Rateliff, John D.). And speaking of characters, the dwarves were modeled after ancient Jewish people and their history (Rateliff, John D.). Last but not least, the epic Beowulf was the main inspiration behind the world Tolkien wanted to create. As Tolkien was a respected scholar of Beowulf, The Hobbit was in part a tribute to the epic and a reworking of it (Purtill, Richard L.).\n\nAfter The Hobbit was published in 1937 on the 21st of September, it quickly sold copies amidst highly favorable reviews (Hammond, Wayne G.). Already by December of 1937, the publisher was asking for a sequel. Tolkien had to rework some of The Hobbit to match the tone of the sequel that eventually became The Lord of the Rings. In fact, he was still making edits to The Hobbit until 1966, through many editions (The Annotated Hobbit).\n\nThe Hobbit, which jumpstarted Tolkien’s career as an author, became not only a success, but also a worldwide phenomenon of fantasy and mythology. The Hobbit and the ensuing trilogy of The Lord of the Rings is so ingrained in world culture, that it is now unimaginable to think of our planet without this treasured novel. Through Tolkien’s love of literature, he incorporated many tales into The Hobbit, and improved their plots, mythology, and sense of kinship with readers.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the four main organs of the United Nations?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The United Nations is currently made up of 193 Member States. It is a well-known intergovernmental organization that focuses on international cooperation and order. Though its headquarters is in Manhattan, New York City, its main offices are in Geneva, Nairobi and Vienna. In the following paragraphs, we will delve into its creation and historical timeline to gain a greater understanding of this key force for world peace.\n\nBefore the United Nations was founded, many other intergovernmental organizations were created to bring countries together for a common a goal of international peace. The International Committee of the Red Cross, the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, and most notably, the League of Nations (Kennedy, Paul). Though the League of Nations was created to maintain harmony between countries, it did not have the representation from colonial peoples, and Japan, the USSR, and Germany did not join. Through this lack of representation, it failed in its actions against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935, the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, and German domination under the reign of Adolf Hitler. Through its failings, the Second World War was able to happen (Kennedy, Paul).\n\nIn 1939, plans were being set for a new world organization under the supervision of the US State Department (Hoopes, Townsend; Brinkley, Douglas). However, it was not until 1941 that the draft of the “Declaration by United Nations” was written by President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins at the White House. In the draft, four allied countries were noted: the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the Republic of China (Urquhart, Brian). The “united nations” referred to allied countries of the Second World War. The next day after the Declaration was officially signed on New Year’s Day in 1942 by the four allied countries, 26 governments also signed the document (United Nations). During the Second World War, more governments signed the document and declared war on the Axis, which were the forces that fought against the allied countries: Germany, Italy, and Japan (Schlesinger, Stephen C.).\n\nHowever, the United Nations as a organization rather than a declaration was created in 1944 at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference by the four major allied forces: the US, the UK, the Soviet Union, and China (Bohlen, C.E). The first United Nations conference, the UN Conference on International Organization, was held in San Francisco on the 25th of April, 1945. 50 governments attended and several non-governmental organizational also were present. These governments and organizations were involved in drafting the UN Charter. The United Nations came into official existence as an organization on October 24, 1945, when the Charter was ratified by the Security Council and the most of the signatories. And finally, the first meetings of the General Assembly were held in London on January 10, 1946 with 51 nations being represented (www.un.org). In its current form, the United Nations comprises four organs: the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Secretariat, and the International Court of Justice.\n\nAs a response to the Second World War, the United Nations was first a treaty declaration between four major regions—the US, the UK, the Soviet Union, and China—and was later developed into an organization that incorporated most of the major countries in the world to maintain international peace and order. The United Nations has been sustained through decades of hardship and wars unlike organizations that had come before it that were similar in nature. We can only hope that this beneficial organization continues its peacekeeping and anti-corruption missions.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the history of feminism?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Though feminism is seen as a modern-day perspective and philosophy, its history extends far back. In fact, feminism does not have, like many movements, a linear history. Its beginnings are difficult to trace, but in the following paragraphs, I will do my best to unravel the earliest recorded works on feminism and works that added to the discourse of the advancement of women within societies.\n\nStrangely enough, the first person credited as advocating for the equality of women was a man: the philosopher Plato. During his lifetime, which was about 24 centuries ago, he “[argued] for the total political and sexual equality of women, advocating that they be members of his highest class, … those who rule and fight” (Baruch, Elaine Hoffman). The next important figure in history to challenge the status quo was French writer Christine de Pizan (1364 – c. 1430). She is said to be the first woman in history to denounce misogyny in writing. Her books The Book of the City of Ladies and Epistle to the God of Love were landmark volumes in her time, and were even presented to Queen Isabeau of Bavaria (de Beauvoir, Simone).\n\nAfter de Pizan, many other feminists worked to get out their message of the equality of the sexes. For instance, in the 16th century, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and Modesta di Pozzo di Forzi were prominent literary figures pushing a feminist agenda. And in the 17th century, Hannah Woolley, Inés de la Cruz, Marie Le Jars de Gournay, Anne Bradstreet, and François Poullain de la Barre were the key literary proponents of feminism (Schneir, Miram). However, one 17th-century writer outshone others during her time in terms of being an advocate for women’s rights: Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Many feminist scholars refer to her as a shining example of how education could shape a woman’s intellect and outdo men’s intelligence. She was said to be brighter than most of men she encountered, which was revolutionary in the 17th century (Makin, Bathsua). Most women in the 17th century were not afforded a proper and full education.\n\nThe more formal introduction of feminist ideals were made in the Age of Enlightenment. In this more secular and introspective time, many writers began to support the equality of women in society as a whole. Jeremy Bentham’s Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation published in 1781 proposed that we should not deny women’s rights based on preconceived notions of women’s lack of intelligence. He gave many examples of intelligent and able women in this volume (Williford, Miriam). Around the same time, Nicolas de Condorcet, a mathematician, politician, revolutionary, and defender of human rights published De l’admission des femmes au droit de cité (For the Admission to the Rights of Citizenship For Women). As a French revolutionary, he was an advocate for women’s suffrage in the fresh French government of 1790 (Williams, David). In 1791, a compatriot, Olympe de Gouges, saw de Condorcet’s failure to appeal to the French National Assembly to change women’s rights, and wrote and printed the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen. This document set a precedent in the way of writing about women’s rights, which was to satirize the style of existing legislation written by men (Hesse, Carla). However, the most essential feminist writer of the time was Mary Wollstonecraft. She is mentioned as the first feminist philosopher, and published the pivotal A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1792. In this work, she noted that the perception of women came almost exclusively from the male perspective, and that both genders contributed to inequality. She determined that both genders needed a proper education to understand and work towards equality. Wollstonecraft had set the stage for writing unabashedly about women’s standing, and what to work towards and how in relation to women’s rights (Foundation for Economic Education).\n\nThough feminism is thought of as a new trend, advocates of women’s rights have been active since Classical Greek times. Plato was the first to be famous for proposing equality among genders, though it was not until Mary Wollstonecraft published A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1792 that feminism claimed a respectable place in literature. Though early feminist literature had been criticized harshly, by the Age of Enlightenment and the Victorian Era, feminist literature had become more commonplace and even respected. In between Plato’s lectures and Wollstonecraft’s essays, there were many other key figures that established what we know of as feminism today. Without their advocacy, the natural born rights of women would not have been achieved on an almost global scale.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the most exotic mental illnesses?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hollywood movies often depict people with mental diseases as weird, scary, or dangerous to others around them. However, unless you are a specialist, in reality it is rarely possible to recognize a mental illness in a person—even a person you communicate with often. People tend to hide such health problems; moreover, sometimes they can even be unaware of having mental issues. So, the stereotype about psychotic weirdos that mass culture actively enforces is, mildly speaking, exaggerated. At the same time, it is true that some mental illnesses can severely distort one’s behaviors, perception of reality, cognitive functions, and emotional reactions, which may make them potentially dangerous to themselves (in the first turn), and to people around them. For example, some forms of schizophrenia can be accompanied by violent and\/or suicidal tendencies; or, Alzheimer disease can severely decrease the quality of a person’s life, and even lead to harm. And, although these diseases are certainly severe and can manifest themselves in a number of peculiar ways, there are mental illnesses that are stranger than fiction.\n\nAll of us are aware of the popularity of zombie movies. The walking dead have become an irreplaceable element of contemporary mass culture. What is more shocking is that there are people who fit the description “living dead.” People suffering from Cotard’s syndrome develop a delusion that they have died. Despite indisputable logic that dead people cannot walk, talk, or think, patients with Cotard’s syndrome cannot shake their delusions off. For example, in 2012, Japanese doctors reported a man who addressed a hospital with the complaint about being dead. He wanted to get a second opinion just in case, but for him it was a fact. After approximately a year of therapy, the man got rid of the symptoms, but he still believed his condition was real. The same happened in 2008 with a 53-year-old New York lady who suddenly developed a conviction that she was dead, and smelled of rotting flesh. She asked her relatives to deliver her to morgue, so that she could stay with other dead people, but instead she was directed to psychiatrists, who quickly returned her back to normal. Sometimes, people with Cotard’s syndrome believe they lack organs, intestines, or limbs. For instance, Jules Cotard, who was the first to describe the disease, once treated a young woman who had developed a firm belief that she was missing her brain, chest, nerves, intestines, and that she was, generally speaking, hollow inside. At the same time, she believed that she was an immortal being, and had no need for nutrition. She died of starvation awhile after meeting Cotard (Mental Floss).\n\nContinuing the grim topic of the living dead, there is an extremely odd disease called the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Although it is not entirely a mental disease, and has both physiological and neurological underlying conditions, it manifests itself in a rather extreme “psychotic” way. In particular, those who suffer from Lesch-Nyhan tend to mutilate themselves, and in some severe cases even eat parts of their own bodies (usually lips or fingers). It is said that in 60% of the cases, patients with this syndrome need to have their teeth removed in order to avoid dealing themselves severe trauma; fortunately, self-cannibalism is a less common manifestation of this syndrome. The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is in general connected to impulse control issues, and is found almost exclusively in boys (Alternet).\n\nPerhaps everyone knows about paranoia—a mental condition generally characterized with the sensation of being observed, followed, controlled, or manipulated. However, fewer people have heard of the Fregoli delusion—a condition that is characterized by a complex and peculiar system of beliefs a patient develops. In particular, the Fregoli delusion makes a person think that people he or she knows closely have been killed or kidnapped, and then substituted by impostors. People with the Fregoli delusion are afraid that these impostors impersonate people they love, and then follow them. Specialists are not sure about the origins of the disease, but assume it might develop because of organic brain damage (Stockton, Richard).\n\nMass culture continues to display mental illnesses as dangerous psychotic conditions. Although it is not necessarily true, and many people with mental diseases are harmless and mostly self-absorbed, there are some exotic psychological conditions Hollywood would gladly put on screen. One of them is Cotard’s syndrome: a disease during which a person develops a belief that he or she has died, or is missing one or multiple vital organs, or is immortal and does not require nutrition. An even more exotic sickness is the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is characterized, among other symptoms, by self-mutilation and self-cannibalistic tendencies. There is also the Fregoli delusion—people suffering from it believe they are surrounded by impostors impersonating people dear to them. These, as well as other similar conditions, are rare, but still dangerous and requiring medical treatment.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the moral aspects of transhumanism?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" During the course of hundreds of thousands of years since the first ancestor of modern homo sapiens stretched its back in a distant, gloomy jungle, humanity has changed a lot. This is true for both physical appearances and mental capabilities: it is a well-known fact that people nowadays are on average smarter than their counterparts two or three hundred years ago. Generally speaking, humanity has been evolving in the same way as other biological species on the planet. Moreover, based on the most significant contemporary tendencies, scientists and futurologists suggest which direction evolution will take, and what people will look and think like in the distant future. Others, though, believe that humanity has reached its evolutionary summit, and that no significant changes in physical appearances and\/or intellectual powers will occur to human beings within the next few centuries.\n\nThis does not necessarily mean there is no chance to evolve anymore. There are scientists, activists, dreamers, writers, and engineers who believe that if mother nature cannot do anything else for humanity in terms of evolution, it is time to take the baton from her. Such a direction of thought has gradually turned into a comprehensive and accomplished ideology shared by thousands of adepts all over the world. This ideology can be generally called transhumanism. The methods of evolution may differ, but one aspect is common for all transhumanist schools and directions of thought. This aspect is artificial evolution.\n\nSo, what exactly is transhumanism? First coined in 1957 by biologist Julian Huxley (whose brother, Aldous Huxley, was a renowned science-fiction novelist, the author of “Brave New World” and other remarkable works), the term “transhumanist” meant “man remaining man, but transcending himself by realizing new possibilities of and for his human nature.” Generally speaking, transhumanism in its modern meaning implies that human beings can be enhanced by the means of science to the extent when they surpass biological limitations and capabilities programmed by nature. The species into which humanity transforms this way will be called posthuman, or transhuman, as it would have be something new—based on human nature, but going beyond it at the same time (Owlcation).\n\nAs it was mentioned, there is no universal way in which adepts of transhumanism would agree to evolve humanity. On the contrary, there are numerous areas which, according to transhumanists, require enhancement, as well as there are countless propositions on the means of such enhancement. In particular, transhumanists work, in particular, on such problems as overcoming the physical boundaries of the human body. Starting with aging, which they believe to be rather a disease than a natural process, and ending up with replacing limbs and organs with their artificial analogs, transhumanists believe that the human body is imperfect, and that it should be improved. All kinds of nanotechnologies for repairing damaged organs; neurostimulants and drugs to alter mood and eliminate negative emotions; brain implants and embedded technologies to allow interconnectivity between multiple human beings and to boost intelligence—these and many more actions are just some of the means transhumanists plan to use to make humanity better (CARM).\n\nSome of the technologies transhumanists plan to employ to push the boundaries of humanity are available already. For example, gene therapy and genetic interference allowing to cure or stop certain diseases that were considered terminal; CRISPRi or SHARP-2 methods, which were discovered not so long ago, have already proved to be efficient in treating or remedying a number of complicated medical conditions, and in case further research is conducted, they might significantly improve the quality of medicine worldwide. Virtual reality, another technology from science-fiction movies of the late 1980s, has become not so virtual either, after all. VR gear can be easily purchased from online stores, and the prices are affordable—given that we are speaking of technology capable of substituting actual reality. So far, it has been mostly used for games and education, but in the future, the range of its useful applications will definitely broaden. Other technologies, which have not yet been invented but which definitely will, include megascale engineering, self-replicating robotics, artificial intelligence, mind uploading technologies, molecular manufacturing, space colonization, and other technological wonders (Lifeboat).\n\nAbout a hundred years ago, the idea of flying in the skies seemed absurd, until Wilbur and Orville Wright proved this assumption wrong. Who knows, perhaps in a couple of decades the concepts listed here, no matter how fantastic they look now, will become reality. Moral aspects and the price humanity will have to pay for such advancements are a different subject.\n\nTranshumanism is a philosophy or ideology that proclaims humanity to have reached the peak of biological evolution; still, considering it necessary to continue evolving, transhumanists suggest an alternative to biological evolution: enhancing humanity through artificial means. They believe technologies can make people smarter, healthier, more efficient and communicative. Cryonics, gene engineering, space colonizations, body implants, artificial intelligence—these are just some of the ways transhumanists plan to push humanity forward. However, “Forward to what?” remains a debated question, as the moral aspects of transhumanism are yet to be studied and pondered upon properly.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the risks of smoking marijuana?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Humanity has been acquainted with drugs for arguably thousands of years. Alcohol, hallucinogens and psychedelics, opioids, various chemical compounds invented not so long ago—these are just some of the substances that have been used and abused all over the world, in different cultures, and for different reasons. For instance, hallucinogenic mushrooms and plants were—and still are—used in shamanism, or for religious ceremonies. Alcohol was an almost indispensable attribute for the majority of social events, starting with feasts at kings’ palaces and ending up with village weddings. Cocaine was once a prescribed medicine that could be legally purchased in a drug store.\n\nThings have changed over the course of centuries. Today, there are perhaps little-to-no people who would not know about the negative effects drugs can have on physical and mental health; at the same time, there are many of those who experiment with drugs, especially in adolescence. One of the most common substances teenagers start (and fortunately, finish) their acquaintance with psychoactive substances is marijuana. Relatively cheap, relaxing, and tolerated in many countries all over the world, it alters a user’s consciousness to a greater extent than alcohol or nicotine. In fact, marijuana is so popular that medical institutions of different countries invest money in research, studying the positive and negative effects of cannabis. So far, we can witness the wave of justification: scientists, physicians, and politicians claim that marijuana is an almost-safe drug, the negative effects of which are so insignificant that they are not worth considering. All this information is widely published on the Internet and other media, causing larger amounts of people to get introduced to smoking pot.\n\nHowever, it is not that simple. As any psychoactive substance, marijuana contains chemicals that affect the brain; as these chemicals are not innate to the human body (no one is born with THC or CBD in their brains), they can—and sometimes do—disturb the subtle balance of biochemical reactions in a way that can be harmful to an individual. Although this perspective has not been too popular currently, let us take a closer look at what harm marijuana can do anyways.\n\nWhat are the short-term effects of smoking marijuana? What does a high look like? Users report that when being under the effect of the drug, they most often experience an altered sense of time: some feel like it passes slowly, whereas others can miss out large periods of time. Decreased reactions are often followed by slow speech and thinking. A marijuana smoker can forget what they were about to say in the middle of a sentence, or what happened to them a minute ago. Many people tend to feel drowsy and\/or sleepy—in fact, marijuana can act as a soporific. Marijuana often causes relaxed mood, and makes almost everything look funny. This is why people laugh so hard when they are under  marijuana high. Also, cannabis users report altered senses and perception: they tend to perceive colors and sounds more vividly, become more sensitive and moody (MedicalMarijuana, Inc).\n\nIt is said that the regular use of marijuana does not impair one’s health, and numerous research studies support this claim. However, there are also not-so-popular studies that prove the opposite: marijuana can be harmful. This is especially fair in the case of teenagers. When a young person, whose brain has not yet fully formed physiologically uses marijuana regularly, it can affect the ways in which the brain builds connections between its areas responsible for memory, concentration, and learning. Whereas people who started smoking pot as adults rarely feel negative mental health effects, for those who were introduced to cannabis as a teenager, the situation is different. For example, a recent study conducted in Duke University, New Zealand, has proved that those who started heavily smoking marijuana as teenagers and developed an addiction lost on average eight IQ points during the period between their 13 and 38 years. In other words, an early exposure to marijuana can make you less intelligent, in a long-term perspective. Moreover, lost mental capabilities do not seem to regenerate on a full scale even after test subjects quit smoking marijuana. Those who started smoking pot as adults had no such problems, but it may be the lack of detailed research (National Institute on Drug Abuse).\n\nEven though marijuana is often consumed as an antidepressant, it is known to worsen mental disorder symptoms—at least in a short-term perspective. In particular, the drug can make a person paranoid, suspicious, or depressed. It can also cause mental conditions such as schizophrenia to become worse. At the same time, it is true that marijuana can make depression symptoms lighter, so it is fair to say that its effects of mental health are complex, and cannot be unequivocally labelled as positive or negative. What is for sure, though, is that marijuana can damage one’s lungs: regularly consuming this drug can cause respiratory problems such as bronchitis, inflammations, and chronic cough—although these effects are still not as severe as when smoking tobacco (MedicalMarijuana, Inc).\n\nMoreover, the usage of marijuana is not recommended to pregnant women. This warning may look superfluous, as everyone is supposed to know that future mothers should avoid all kinds of substances in order to not cause harm to a child, but in fact, more and more women expecting a child are starting to smoke marijuana, as a 2016 JAMA study states. Exposing an unborn baby to marijuana can cause them severe health problems; in particular, it is known that babies whose mothers smoked marijuana during pregnancy had low birth weight, anemia, and impaired impulse control. They also had attention and memory problems (Health.com).\n\nAs it can be seen, marijuana is not as harmless as it is widely believed nowadays. Although its negative health effects can be subtle for those who started smoking it as an adult, for younger users, it can have a number of negative side effects—impaired cognitive capabilities, for example. Marijuana can also cause or worsen symptoms of several mental disorders, and is especially dangerous for unborn babies, in case if a women smoke it during pregnancy. Overall, it can be said that the risks of smoking marijuana outweigh its benefits.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the most common misconceptions about introverts?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Throughout recent decades, psychology has become extremely popular among people of all ages across continents. Having started (in its modern appearance) as a radical theory proposed by the Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud, it quickly became a remedy for a number of mental dysfunctions, neuroses, and inner conflicts. Freud’s ideas had been developed by his numerous followers founding new psychological theories, challenging and disputing Freud’s original conceptions.\n\nOne of such followers was Carl Jung, most famous for his theory of archetypes and the collective unconscious. Along with other important discoveries, Jung gave the world a classification of personality types, which is now perhaps the most popular and well-known among many others. He claimed that people tend to fall into two categories: introverts and extroverts.\n\nOf extroverts, we seem to know a lot. This is because they are more numerous, and also because western culture is oriented mostly on an extroverted type of communication and activity. Most people tend to think of extroverts as the “doers”; introverts are less noticeable, and thus less comprehended, compared to extroverts. The popular misconception about introverts is that they are cold, unemotional, and reluctant book worms. This cannot be any further from the truth. Let us take a closer look at what typical features and personality traits introverts possess.\n\nOne of the most widespread myths about introverts is that they are unsociable hermits escaping any contact with other people whenever possible. This is due to the basic difference in the mechanisms of accumulating and spending energy introverts and extroverts have: whereas extroverts gain energy in social contacts and interactions and spend it when they are alone, introverts, on the contrary, gain energy in solitude, and spend it when socializing and interacting with their environments. In other words, introverts lose energy during communication at roughly the same rate as extroverts lose it in solitude. This is why introverts prefer being alone: not all the time, as many people believe, but for as long as they need to recover for new social interactions. While for extroverts, the best way to have a rest is to hang out with friends or engage in a fun and exciting activity, introverts replenish their inner resources by reading, listening to music, engaging in hobbies, or thinking about whatever they find interesting. So, “fully charged” introverts are not too different from extroverted people: they love socializing, having fun, and spending time with friends, but they need to take breaks, and tolerate prolonged periods of solitude better (Verywell Mind).\n\nSpeaking of friends: introverts are usually more picky and peculiar about their surroundings. This is not because they are snobbish or contemptuous; rather, introverts tend to seek deeper, long-lasting, and more meaningful relationships than extroverts. Introverts can get along with new people just as good as extroverts, but they are more careful about letting people get close to them, and prefer bonding only with people whom they truly trust (Collective Evolution). It is fair to say that introverts prefer the quality of relationships over quantity, so they tend to seek people with diverse interests and a deep inner world.\n\nIntroverts tend to be more productive and creative when they work on their own. Although interacting with a team of coworkers is usually not a problem, it requires an introvert to spend additional energy to communicate, explaining their ideas to the public, and defending their point of view, if needed. Rather than doing all this (and thus robbing themselves of creative capabilities), introverts often prefer to work on ideas alone, sharing only the results of their work (Collective Evolution).\n\nIn addition, introverts are extremely self-aware. They tend to dig deep into their feelings, thoughts, dim and unclear sensations—unless they figure out what lies underneath. This can be both beneficial and destructive for them, especially if they do not know how to deal with the discoveries they make about themselves.\n\nOverall, it is important to say that introverts are not the egocentric and cold rationalists our society tends to portray them as. Their behavior is more about the ways they gain and expend energy: whereas extroverts (who make up the majority of the population) draw it from social interactions and communication, introverts recharge their batteries in solitude, spending their energy resources in social situations. Introverts also tend to be more self-sufficient, working and feeling better when left alone; on the other hand, they tend to have less friends and social contacts, and their tendency to dig deep into their inner world may sometimes cause them emotional stress.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of gambling addiction?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are many things people can get addicted to. Nowadays, it is not uncommon to run into news headlines such as, “More and more, teenagers fall victim to Internet addiction,” or “X has been proven to cause addiction,” where X can be almost anything. It is well-known that along with the “classical” addiction to certain substances (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, drugs, narcotics, and so on), there are addictions more of a psychological nature: sex addiction, emotional addiction, addiction to video games, adult movies addiction, and so on.\n\nOne of the most destructive—in terms of personal and social well-being—is a gambling addiction, or gambling disorder. Usually, it is associated with casinos, roulette, card games, and so on, although in a broader perspective a gambling addiction implies compulsive engagement in games of chance: the thrill comes from risking something valuable in order to get something of an even greater value.\n\nLet us take a closer look at what a gambling addiction is, what are its symptoms, and in which ways it can be dangerous to a person and people surrounding them.\n\nFirst of all, it is important to know that gambling works like substances: it stimulates the brain’s reward system, making a person crave more of the pleasant activity, and gradually raises his or her tolerance towards stimuli (Mayo Clinic). In other words, as time goes on, a person needs stronger stimuli to achieve the same intensity of sensations. Gambling is a widespread problem: only in the United States, up to 3% of population are compulsive gamblers; the severity and diversity of symptoms varies depending on a gambler’s gender and age, but overall it is clear that millions of Americans are addicted to games of chance (MedicineNet.com).\n\nIt might seem that a gambling addiction is not as awful and destructive as in the case with drugs of alcohol; however, this is not true. Gambling, when it turns from a leisure activity into a pathology, it can ruin one’s personal and social life, career, self-esteem, and lead to unpredictable but dire consequences. If we take a look at the symptoms in which addictive gambling manifests itself, we will see how dangerous it is. It is essential to mention that there is pathological gambling, and there is problem gambling; the only aspect they differ in is the quantity and the intensity of symptoms. Gambling is considered problematic when a person demonstrates more than one but less than five symptoms of addictive gambling, whereas a pathology starts from five and above (MedicineNet.com). In both cases, it is important to see a specialist in order to help a person get over the problem.\n\nOne of the most typical symptoms of compulsive gambling is the constant preoccupation with it: a person will always think about it, plan it, and seek money to be able to make a bet. However, the same amount of money is never enough: in order to obtain satisfaction, a gambler constantly needs to increase the sums of money—otherwise the high is not intense enough. If such a person loses multiple times, instead of stopping, he or she begins “chasing losses,” which means gambling more in order to win back the money that was lost. In order to garner more money, a gambling addict can resort to immoral actions (lying) and crime (theft, robbery, fraud), or asking others to bail him or her out. At the same time, the gambler will try to hide the scales of his or her gambling problem from his or her family members and friends, secretly trying to cut back or stop gambling (as a rule, they fail in these attempts). All this leads to decreased self-esteem, depression, problems with the law or with criminals, loss of a job and\/or family, and can result in even more intense gambling, since people addicted to it use it to escape their problems (Mayo Clinic).\n\nAs we can see, gambling is a vicious cycle that can rarely be broken by a person on his or her own; usually, in order to get rid of the problem, it is required that a gambler reaches out for professional psychological assistance. Gambling can cause serious financial problems, ruin relationships and careers, lead to depression and crime, and in general consume too much time and resources to be considered a regular leisure activity.###"}
{"prompt":"How did the development of writing systems affect the way history was recorded?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" To understand history is an immense task. There is prehistory, or the history before any recorded history; protohistory, which is the period of transition between prehistory and recorded history where written language was being formed; and then you have recorded history. Recorded history means written accounts of happenings in the past. Many cultures only had an oral tradition of history, and sometimes written history in some countries has only started recently. Let us look at the beginning of recorded history, and see how it unfolded.\n\nThough there is some argument has to what constitutes written history, as there were Jiahu symbols around 6600 B.C., Vinca signs around 5300 B.C., and more examples of very simple scripts (Smail, Daniel Lord), writing systems were being developed starting from the early dynastic periods of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Sumer. At this time, approximately 3500 B.C., these three regions were developing writing systems at roughly the same time and composing chronologies (Kott, Ruth E). However, the earliest written history was mostly concerning Pharaohs, though the reliability and quality of the accounts have been put into question. These accounts were found at archaeological dig sites (Greer, Thomas H.). The languages used for the earliest historical records were Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Sumerian archaic cuneiform script.\n\nTraveling to China, around 2000 B.C., history started being recorded in oracle bone script (Acta Archaeologica Sinica). Later, in 5th century China, the Zuo Zhuan was written by Zuo Qiuming. This document is the first written narrative historical record, and covers Chinese history from 722 to 468 B.C. (Boltz, William G.). Not long after, historical records were taken to a new level with The Book of Documents, or Shujing, which had recorded speeches of the Zhou Dynasty, and information about other dynasties. It has 58 chapters, each having a preface supposedly written by the great philosopher Confucius (Baxter, William H.; Sagart, Laurent).\n\nLastly, coming to Europe, we have The Histories written by Herodotus of Halicarnassus between the 450s to the 420s B.C. Though the record is partial in terms of perspective, it covers the history of wars and politics between Western Asia, Northern Africa, and Greece at the time (Herodotus). However, though written a bit later, History of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides (c. 460 B.C. – c. 400 B.C.) is said to be the first impartial record of history through a well-developed method, which presents information objectively (Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C. & Jeremy A. Sabloff).\n\nThrough the earlier accounts of history from Egypt and Sumer, to the scientific Greek historical narratives, written history has taken its time to develop it style, presentation, and craftsmanship. Beginning with the formation of symbols in protohistory, literacy blossomed as early as 3500 B.C., and people have been telling the story of what it is like to live on Earth and what happened before their time ever since. Though historical accounts are never exactly objective, they are windows into a time we can only imagine.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the negative health effects of drinking Coca-Cola and other sugary beverages?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The power of brands is something no one nowadays (at least no one sane) would deny. Several decades ago, brands would attract customers with established reputations, clever advertising, and the quality of what they produced; currently, brands declare and promote values, and those whom these values appeal to become loyal customers of one brand or another. And there are brands that have already been long enough on the market to be renowned and trusted, and which never disdain from new marketing and advertising trends; such brands possess a double power: the power of tradition and history, and the power of modern technologies.\n\nSuch brands are numerous, and people consume many goods produced by them without even critically evaluating the value, purpose, and reason of such consumption. For example, instead of seeing into a number of cell phone models present on the market and choosing the one most suitable for their needs, an average customer simply goes for an iPhone, just because he or she knows that “it’s a good phone.” But how do they know if they have supposedly never tried it out before? The answer is advertising and the power of branding: Apple markets its devices extremely cleverly, turning them into something similar to an apple (pun intended) from the Eden knowledge tree.\n\nOr, let us take Pepsi: people who want caffeinated soda just go and buy Pepsi; they do not need to think twice, because marketologists, advertising agencies, and the communications this brand constructs have already determined these people’s choices. But if you ask, “Why have you chosen Pepsi specifically? How is it different from other competitors such as Coca-Cola?” The answer will most likely be unintelligible, because there are no specific reasons to choose Pepsi over Coke, or vice versa.\n\nSpeaking of Coca-Cola and other soda drinks similar to it, the power of advertising is so great that its consumers rarely or never think about the effects these drinks have on one’s body. Further on in this paper, writing “Coca-Cola” will also mean any other caffeinated soda drink: Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, whatsoever. The truth is that Coca-Cola is able to negatively affect one’s health condition in a number of peculiar ways. Let us take a closer look at what people who drink soda a lot subject themselves to.\n\nObviously, these drinks contain a lot of caffeine and sugar—which, if consumed regularly and uncontrollable, can lead to a number of diseases such as diabetes. Besides, Coca-Cola and other similar drinks contain Aspartame: an artificial non-saccharide sweetener used instead of sugar. It is funny how people caring about their health buy Cola “without sugar,” thinking they are on the safer side; the irony is that Aspartame used in such drinks is more harmful than sugar: in several developed countries, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and other companies using Aspartame in their products have been sued for using it (Healthy Drinks). Aspartame is highly disparaged for the consumption of children, as it can cause several diseases, obesity and cancer in particular. It is important to mention though that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (as well as health organizations in 90 countries around the world) have found Aspartame safe for consumption.\n\nSpeaking of sugar in beverages: according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sugary drinks are being regularly consumed by approximately 50% of the United States population; by “regularly” statistics mean any given day. The highest rate of consumed sugary beverages is among teenagers. A regular can of soda is claimed to contain an equivalent of 10 teaspoons of sugar; at the same time, the amount recommended for daily consumption by the WHO (World Health Organization) equals just six teaspoons maximum, which means that drinking a single can of Pepsi or Coca-Cola means exceeding the advised rate by 1.5 times. Research conducted by Harvard School of Public Health suggests that those who drink up to two cans of soda per day have, on average, a 26% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This, as well as the fact that, according to some research, the overconsumption of sugar causes 184,000 global deaths annually (Medical News Today).\n\nOther negative health effects of drinking Cola include problems with teeth, in particular, dental erosion and dental demineralization, hypersensitivity of teeth, calcium washing out, and ruination of enamel. This, as well as the fact that Coca-Cola drinks contain phosphoric acid and some other dangerous chemical substances, should be enough for a regular consumer to rethink his or her position on drinking soda (Flipper).\n\nPeople rarely evaluate their consumption critically; most often, their consumption is guided by advertising and brand communication. Even when consumers are well aware of the negative effects of the products they consume, they rarely change their habits. In particular, this tendency applies to Coca-Cola and other sugary beverages: even though they can cause diabetes, heart diseases, problems with teeth, obesity, and even early death, the number of consumers preferring soda over regular water remains high all over the world.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the main reasons people get angry?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Anger seems simple when we are feeling it, but the causes of anger are multiple. Knowing these causes can make us introspect about our behavior, and amend bad habits. Anger is rarely looked upon as a beneficial character trait, and is usually advised to reduce it or eliminate it. The main reasons we get angry is due to triggering events, personality traits, and our appraisal of situations. Understanding these reasons will curb our own anger if we are willing to evaluate ourselves with a critical eye.\n\nTriggering events for anger are so numerous that to describe them all would take hundreds of pages. However, here are some examples: being cut off in traffic, someone using a patronizing tone with you, being hungry, being tired, a deadline is approaching, you failed at something, a machine is not working, you have financial issues, you witnessed an injustice, experiencing physical pain, and much more (TheHopeLine). Not everyone acts the same in response to events, and that is why what triggers one person may or may not trigger another person. The reason why someone is triggered by something and others are not is often due to one’s personal history, conditioning, and psychological traits (Martin, Ryan).\n\nEach person, no matter who they are, has psychological imbalances (mind.org). People who have personality traits that connect with narcissism, competitiveness, and low frustration tolerance are much more likely to get angry. Having these personality traits imply the pre-anger state, where anger is in the background of your consciousness (Martin, Ryan). Also, sometimes pre-anger does not have to do with a lasting condition, but rather a temporary state before a triggering event has occurred. Say you spilled a cup of coffee on yourself in your car right before someone cut you off while you were driving to work. These types of situations also allow pre-anger to appear.\n\nOur attitude and perspective on situations can create anger within us as well. Sometimes even routine or mandatory occurrences become sources of pre-anger, or anger itself. For example, a person of Arab descent goes through customs in the airport. One of the customs officers asks him or her if he or she is carrying any weapons. He or she gets upset and thinks the customs officer is asking him or her this specific question due to his or her genetic traits. However, what he or she does not know is this is a standard question that customs officers are instructed to ask every passenger through a checkpoint. Sometimes ignorance and negative outlooks on situations can create anger (Martin, Ryan).\n\nAnger is a particularly strong emotion and maybe people think that the feeling is justified. However, anger can easily turn violent and chaotic, and it is best to know the reasons for anger to appear in order to thwart its presence. The main reasons anger comes about are triggering events, personality traits, and our perspective on situations. With these in mind, we can evaluate our level of anger throughout the day and see if we can prevent instances of outbursts by comprehending the reasons for our emotions.###"}
{"prompt":"How does water affect life forms?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" We take water for granted. Though we drink it throughout the day, though we cannot function without it, and though it is present in all life forms on Earth, we rarely stop to think about what makes up water and how it operates. There is more to water than just H2O. In the following paragraphs, I will divulge the details of water in terms of its exact composition, its significance on Earth, and how it affects life forms.\n\nThough most people would say that water comprises H2O, or that its molecule has one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, there is more to that statement that meets the eye. Water is a polar inorganic compound (does not contain carbon) that is a tasteless and odorless liquid at room temperature. It is almost colorless as well, with a touch of blue. Water is the most studied chemical compound and the simplest hydrogen chalcogenide (Greenwood, Norman N.; Earnshaw, Alan). At normal terrestrial conditions, water takes the form of a liquid, solid, and gas. In fact, it is the only chemical substance on Earth that can exist as three states naturally. Water is so unique and precious to Earth that there are 40 anomalies that comprise water. For example, when water freezes, it expands about 9%, and that “warm water vibrates longer than cold water” (fathersergio.wordpress.com).\n\nWater might be Earth’s greatest resource. About 71% of Earth is covered with water, and all life forms on Earth require water to survive. Thus, without water, there would be no life on Earth. Humans use water in more ways than any other species on the planet: cooking, washing their bodies, washing clothes, washing cooking eating utensils, keeping residencies and communities clean, recreation such as swimming pools, maintaining gardens, spiritual practices, farming, drinking, fire extinguishing, and more (Department of Health). All this requires a massive amount of water, and on Earth, the total water supply is approximately a volume of 1,338,000,000 km3. Most of the water on Earth is sea water, but it is also in the atmosphere as a solid, liquid, and gas (Gleick, P.H., ed.). Even below the ground, there are aquifers. Basically, water is everywhere we can imagine on Earth, and flows through each life form, no matter what it is. Also, through the water cycle, with evaporation, precipitation, and runoff, water is constantly flowing through Earth.\n\nBut what happens when life forms consume water? Water allows organic organisms to replicate, it acts as a solvent, and it is key in metabolic processes. Specifically, water is taken from molecules to grow bigger molecules; in contrast, water is also used to create smaller molecules by breaking bonds. In addition, water is essential to photosynthesis and respiration. According to the Royal Society of Chemistry, “Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, some bacteria and some protistans use the energy from sunlight to produce glucose from carbon dioxide and water. This glucose can be converted into pyruvate which releases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by cellular respiration. Oxygen is also formed” (RSC). Furthermore, water is the basic component of acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. Shmoop describes water’s acid-base neutrality as such: “When water meets up with a base (like NH3), it acts as an acid by transferring a proton to the base. Alternatively, when water meets up with an acid (like HCl), it acts as a base by accepting a proton from the acid. What if, by some strange twist of fate, water meets itself? Suddenly, the curtain of water’s double-life deception is pulled and water-as-an-acid must face water-as-a-base” (Shmoop Editorial Team). In terms of enzyme function, “Enzymes require a certain level of water in their structures in order to maintain their natural conformation, allowing them to deliver their full functionality. In addition, depending on the type of the reaction, water can be a substrate (e.g., in hydrolysis) or a product (e.g., in esterolysis) of the enzymatic reaction, influencing the enzyme turnover in different ways. It is found that regardless of the type of reaction, the functionality of enzyme itself is maximum at an optimum level of water, beyond which the enzyme performance is declined due to the loss in enzyme stability” (Rezaei K., Jenab E, Temelli F.). As you can see, without water, our normal body functions would not exist and operate.\n\nWe use water throughout our days without much thought to its importance. It is the most essential chemical compound on Earth, as without it, no life would exist on this planet. Humans and animals alike use water daily for not only sustaining life, but for enjoyment as well. Each day, I believe we should give some thought or appreciation to the significance of water in our lives, and how it fuels our planet.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the unique characteristics of the ocean sunfish?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Every time scientists plunge into the darkest depths of the ocean, they come upon new, startling species. Sometimes only one deep dive can uncover thousands of new species. This adds to the perspective that there are a myriad of wonderful and strange species that lurk in the recesses of the ocean. One such amazing creature is the ocean sunfish, or common mola. Its massive body, weird shape, and peculiar way of movement has shocked onlookers for centuries. Let us learn more about its naming and taxonomy, physical characteristics, and behavior.\n\nIn a variety of languages, “sunfish” refers to its shape and sometimes its actions. In English, its name comes from the fact that it has a habit of sunbathing at the surface of the water. However, in many languages, such as Dutch, Portuguese, French, Catalan, and more, its name is “moonfish.” Its strange shape has inspired several unusual names over the course of history. In terms of classification, though it used to be identified as a pufferfish, it is now said to be in its own genus named Mola (Froese, Rainer, and Daniel Pauly).\n\nThe appearance of a sunfish continues to astonish people. It does not have back fins per se, but rather a rounded clauvas that acts as a rudder. It has relatively large dorsal fins that are sometimes mistaken for shark fins. Laterally, its body is flattened, and it only has small pectoral fins that resemble fans. The sunfish looks like some part of its body is missing. But what they are not missing is weight and overall size. The largest recorded sunfish was 3.2 meters (10.5 feet) in height. However, the average fin-to-fin height of a sunfish is 2.5 meters (8.2 feet). Probably the most impressive physical statistic of the sunfish is its weight: one specimen was found to be 2,300 kilograms (5,100 pounds) (Rowan, Juliet). Its bone structure is unique as well, with the shortest spinal column of any fish in relation to its body. Its skeleton is mostly made up of cartilaginous tissues. These tissues are lighter than bone, and thus provide an opportunity for the sunfish to grow to sizes much larger than most bony fish. For some more bony information, its teeth have a beak-like structure, and the sunfish even has pharyngeal teeth in its throat. Apparently, getting eaten by this fish is no joke.\n\nThis weird fish is in every temperate and tropical ocean in the world. They can get around well, despite having unusual fins, sometimes traveling up to 26 kilometers (16 miles) in a day at a speed of about 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) per hour. They keep relatively close to the surface, with them going no more than 600 meters (2000 feet) deep. Though they seem kind of slow, they can move rapidly when it comes to avoiding getting attacked and when they want to go on the offensive. Most of their time is spent, in fact, hunting below 200 meters (660 feet). When they do go to the surface, laying horizontally, they are thought to be raising their temperature for a long dive into colder waters (British Marine Life Study Society). And when these creatures hunt, they are looking for jellyfish. That is right: not usually our idea of a scrumptious meal. Though most of their diet consists of jellyfish, they like the taste of smaller fishes, fish larvae, squid, and crustaceans (Scientific Reports). Another unusual characteristic of this fish is how many babies the females produce: up to 300 million eggs (Kooijman, S. A. L. M., & Lika, K.). Even more fascinating is that they can grow 60 million times their size from birth. There are still some mysteries about this fish. Scientists are not aware of how long they can live in the wild, though they commonly live up to 10 years in captivity. Also, the mating practices of sunfish are not entirely understood. In addition, without it having a swim bladder, scientists only guess how it stays afloat.\n\nThe sunfish is a sight to behold as a giant, flattened fish without tail fins, and it is equally fascinating within with its rare bone structure, teeth, and capacity to reproduce at extraordinary rates. Though it is massive, it does not provide any harm towards divers and aids us in keeping the jellyfish population at bay, no pun intended. Sunfish (or “moonfish” if you are talking about them in Dutch, for example) is one of the wonders of the world, and its threatened status should be reversed, especially with its capacity to give birth to 300 millions babies.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some signs of psychological manipulation?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Being a part of a society implies communicating with a number of different people. And, of course, any interaction and act of communication with another person should be as transparent and honest as possible; the ideal model of communication usually assumes that all communicators are free to express themselves, and are free of tension and\/or manipulations. Unfortunately, the reality is not so rosy, and people often engage in manipulations, or become subjected to them.\n\nThe Internet nowadays is full or recommendations on how to recognize whether you are being manipulated; the authors of such articles often show manipulators almost as villains consciously and purposefully deceiving people around them. This is not necessarily true; a lot of manipulators are, in fact, people who did not manage to learn how to communicate directly, so for them, indulging into psychological trickery remains one of the few options to get what they need in everyday situations. There are, however, people for whom manipulations have turned into a profession: salesmen, advertisers, agitators, preachers, and so on. Regardless of the motives of the person you communicate with, it is always important and useful to be able to recognize manipulations in order to be able to withstand and oppose them. Let us take a look at some of the most typical signs of psychological manipulations.\n\nOne of the common strategies of psychological manipulations is to knock the ground from under the opponent’s feet; this is usually achieved through marginalizing the opponent and mocking him or her. This is commonly done indirectly, in a form of “friendly” pandering, joking, or “giving advice.” By regularly ridiculing you, a manipulator gradually knocks you off balance, undermining your self-confidence and makes you feel inferior compared to him or her. A manipulator rarely or never comments negatively about your actions, but rather about your personality; instead of telling you that you did something wrong, a manipulator will rather assume there is something wrong with you, with your personality and\/or psyche, so you would feel inadequate and not good enough. Considering that a manipulator never provides solutions to your real or imaginary flaws, or that all critiques come in form of “harmless” jokes which make it easy to avoid victim’s defensive aggression, defending oneself from a manipulator’s attacks can be difficult if you are not aware of what is going on (Psychology Today).\n\nOne of the most dangerous techniques intentionally or unintentionally used by manipulators is called “gaslighting.” The name comes from the classical British movie “Gaslight” filmed in 1940, which displays some of the typical methods gaslighters use to abuse their victims. In particular, gaslighting includes making a victim doubt his or her words and\/or perception (“You never told this to me,” or “I never said that,” when you are sure you said or heard something and even have proof), telling blatant lies straight to someone’s face to confuse a person and make them more susceptible to future manipulations, devaluing and depreciating victim’s emotions, feelings, experiences, and so on (Britannica.com).\n\nYet another typical way for a manipulator to make you feel worse is to blackmail you emotionally. Most often, it includes the evoking of such feelings as shame and guilt in the victim; however, even though this manipulation can be manifested directly (“…if you do X, I will tell your friends\/children\/relatives that you…”), it most often comes in a more subtle and sophisticated form. A manipulator can wrap his or her abuse in the form of a compliment (“Of all people, you should know that…” or “I cannot believe that you, with your intelligence and experience, fell for his\/her…”); although such phrases seemingly emphasize the victim’s positive traits, in fact they make a person feel stupid and inferior. More blatant approaches include the usage of intimidation (“If you do\/do not do X now, it will be too late”), casting doubts (“The grass might be not as green on the other side as it seems”), and even swapping roles, when the manipulator and the victim changes sides. The latter is one of the favorite techniques used in dysfunctional relationships: frequently, one person gets tired of his or her abusive partner, and attempts to leave; the partner then plays victim, saying something like, “I will not be able to live without you,” or even “If you leave, I’ll kill myself.” This is a strong sucker punch, but many responsible and honest people fall for this trap. If nothing works, a blackmailer can suddenly seize all the attempts to manipulate the victim; the victim then becomes confused and even grateful for this temporary truce, and is more prone to do what the manipulator wants from him or her on his or her own account or will (PsychCentral).\n\nManipulators may have different motives for playing with your feelings. Some do it on purpose, although the majority of people do not know a better way of communicating their needs to others. Regardless of the reasons, psychological manipulations can cause moral harm to a victim, so it is important to be able to recognize such manipulation techniques as shaming, gaslighting, moral confusion and ridiculing, making the victim feel inferior, and so on. The more educated and aware of such techniques you are, the easier and more “ecological” your communication with the manipulator becomes (if, for some reason, you need to continue this communication).###"}
{"prompt":"What are the origins of Google?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Google has become a premier technology company that now dominates the search engine market and is always on the cusp of technological innovation, such as with products like Google Glass. Though this giant of a company seems to have always been around, it has an intriguing history behind it. In the following paragraphs, let us explore Google’s climb to prominence.\n\nHaving its origins as a research project called “BackRub” under the supervision of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both PhD students at Stanford University, Google began as a search for a dissertation theme (Google). Page’s dissertation supervisor, Terry Winograd, suggested that he focus on what webpages link to certain pages based on backlinks (Wired). Page was joined by Brin under a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship, but Page had known Brin for some time already while they were working on the Stanford Digital Library Project (Computer Networks and ISDN Systems).\n\nAs a beginning point, the team used the Stanford homepage for their web crawler to explore in March of 1996 (Wired). In the process of exploring the homepage, the two developed the PageRank algorithm, which converted backlink data on webpages based on importance. They discovered that this method of sifting through data was more efficient than the current one, which measured how many times a term appeared on a page (Wired). With this concept, they tested their thesis that the most relevant webpages were those that had the most links to them.\n\nThe search engine’s domain was originally google.stanford.edu; however, by September 1997, they registered google.com. Another big step was in September of 1998, when Page and Brin incorporated the company “Google.” Though they initially were against employing advertising on a search engine, they eventually inserted plain text advertisements in order to make the search engine profitable (Planet Google). Already by 1998, 60 million pages were indexed by Google (Rosenberg, Scott). Though at this time the homepage of Google was still in “beta,” it was garnering praise from the technology community as the future of web development (Rosenberg, Scott).\n\nWith so much success, in March 1999, Google moved from its garage in Menlo Park, California, to Palo Alto, California alongside other popular startups in Silicon Valley (Fried, Ian). However, the company was a rising power, and soon needed to lease a complex of buildings in the same area in 2003.\n\nPart of Google’s fast growth was the search engine’s simple design and how its text advertising catered to search keywords (Google). The simple text advertisements worked well, as pages could load faster than if complex advertisements were used, and the advertisements were directed at consumers intuitively. With its sharp rise to dominance in the search engine market, Google declared that their code of conduct was “Don’t be evil” and stated that, “We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served—as shareholders and in all other ways—by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains” (Ovide, Shira).\n\nFast forward to 2014, and Google occupied over 70 offices in more than 41 countries (Google Company). However, by 2015, Google became a holding company called Alphabet Inc. with Google as only one of its products (Womack, Brian). Google has never looked back: it created Google + (a social media platform), its version of Wikipedia called Knol, smart glasses called Google Glass, comprehensive world maps, and much more. Google has had partnerships with NASA, AOL, Sun Microsystems, News Corporation, Sky UK, and other organizations. It understands it is still the future of the web, and its possibilities for growth seem unlimited.\n\nStarting off as a research project of two PhD students to study the backlinks between webpages on the University of Stanford website, Google has become an international phenomenon that powers most internet searches and is a front runner in numerous technological advancements, whether they be for phones, going to space, driverless cars, and much more. The amount of Google products seem endless and there are only more being developed at an ever-increasing rate.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the causes, symptoms, and diagnoses of whiplash?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Whiplash, though it sounds like a strange word, renders a victim excruciating pain. It is marked by an injury to the cervical spine by a jolting movement of the head. Neck injuries are notorious for being painful and serious, and whiplash is no exception. Let us look at some of the causes, symptoms, and diagnoses of whiplash.\n\nThe cause of whiplash is almost always associated with a car crash. According to MedicineNet, “The mechanics of a whiplash injury are thought to be as follows: the victim may be first pushed or accelerated forward, pushing the body forward, but the head remains behind momentarily, rocking up and back, and some muscles and ligaments in and around the spine may be stretched or torn. These muscles, in a reflex action, contract to bring the head forward again, to prevent excessive injury. There may be overcompensation when the head is traveling in a forward direction as the vehicle decelerates. This may rock the head violently forward, stretching and tearing more muscles and ligaments” (Definition of Whiplash Injury). Usually, this circumstance appears when someone is struck from behind by another car.\n\nWith such a severe physiological issue, many symptoms are bound to arise. The most common symptoms connected with whiplash are: neck pain and stiffness, headache, shoulder pain and stiffness, dizziness, fatigue, jaw pain, arm pain, arm weakness, visual disturbances, ringing in the ears, back pain, depression, anger, frustration, anxiety, stress, drug dependency, post-traumatic stress syndrome, and sleep disturbance (MS, Jason C. Eck DO.) Depending on the severity of the injury, the spectrum of which these symptoms occur will be different.\n\nAfter being in a car crash or accident, it is important to visit your doctor, especially in the case of whiplash. According to MedicineNet, “The doctor will examine the patient to determine if they have any injuries that require treatment. Based on the symptoms and examination findings the doctor may place a collar on the neck for additional support. The doctor may also obtain x-rays of the neck to check for more serious injuries. The most important first step is to make sure there is no major injury to the neck, head or the rest of the body requiring immediate treatment ” (What Is Whiplash?). In the case of the x-ray coming back as normal, yet there is still pain in the neck, the doctor might request the patient to keep the neck in place. This is usually done for a week, and if more pain continues, additional x-rays are taken in varying positions of the neck, or an MRI is completed. MRIs are done when x-rays seem to not pick up damage done by whiplash.\n\nWhiplash is a terrible injury done to the cervical spine that incurs many symptoms. It is commonly caused by a rear-end car accident, and requires immediate attention from doctors in the form of x-rays and MRIs. The best action to avoid getting whiplash is to always leave sufficient space between you and the person driving behind you. However, you cannot always avoid bad drivers.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of joining extracurricular activities in school?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" School can be a drab place. For those who are not interested in one’s own education, school can be bleak. However, if you are active in extracurricular activities at your school, you can enjoy your education much more. Why is this? Joining in on extracurricular activities have been shown to improve academic performance, give the opportunity to learn a variety of skills, provide a sense of commitment, and create a wider circle of friends.\n\nAccording to The Educator, “Studies have shown that students who participate in co-curricular activities have a marked improvement in the grades. This can be attributed to skills they learn such as better time management to accommodate their hobbies and class activities, better organizational skills and a boost in their self-esteem. Skills learnt in clubs such as debate can be applied in the classroom too, as the students learn how to express themselves better” (Jackson and Jackson, 2018). Though it may seem out of place to say such activities as being part of the Harry Potter Club, or something similar, would benefit one’s grades, it is scientifically proven to do so.\n\nExtracurricular activities have been linked to the gaining of various skills. The Mountain Heights Academy expresses this finding: “These activities can also work to build professional skills that a classroom alone cannot always foster. A leadership-oriented club, for example, will help students to learn essential skills in management and delegation, while a debate or speech club will provide additional public speaking practice for students. In short, extracurricular activities can arm students with many of the skills future employers will be looking for” (Mountainheightsacademy.org, 2018). So, these activities can be seen as a necessary side education that fills in the gaps of our primary education.\n\nCommitment is difficult to inculcate in the youth, but extracurricular activities seem to foster it. According to The Educator, “Students who participate in co-curricular activities have a sense of commitment to whatever they are involved in. This is because as they take part in whatever sports or club activity they are a member of, they have to commit to it and give their all, and this commitment extends to all other areas of their lives” (Jackson and Jackson, 2018). Students can be taught about commitment, but learning it firsthand through extracurricular activities is the best method of teaching commitment.\n\nSchools can be lonely places, and extracurricular activities provide a venue for more social interaction. The Mountain Heights Academy agrees with this notion: “Extracurriculars are not solely about imparting stronger professional skills and supplementing education. These programs are also fun and offer students the opportunity to spend time with others of similar interests. Students can meet friends from different social groups by joining a sports team, student government or debate” (Mountainheightsacademy.org, 2018). It may seem out of place, but by making more friends through extracurricular activities, students can improve their overall academic experience.\n\nExtracurricular activities are not only for enjoyment. They contribute significantly to the improvement of grades, to learning various skills, to garnering a sense of commitment, and to increasing one’s social circle. All of this makes one’s academic experience fulfilling and enriching.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the main reasons for Islam's exceptional growth?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Though Christianity is the largest religion currently, Islam may overtake this position in the next 50 years. Despite bad press, with Islam being associated with terrorism and ultra-conservationism, the most reliable studies have determined that Islam will continue to grow at breakneck speed. The main reasons for Islam’s exceptional growth is that Muslims in general give birth to more children than participants of other major religions do; Islam has more people at the age for giving birth than any other religious group; more than a third of Muslims live in areas of the world where the population expected to be the fastest growing; and religion switching is not expected to hinder Islam like it will for Christianity.\n\nMuslims seem to be not shy to have many children. On a global scale, Muslims have the highest fertility rate, with 3.1 children on average born to a Muslim woman (Pew Research Center). In comparison, Christians, who have the second-highest fertility rate, bear 2.7 children per woman. Why are Muslim women having so many children? There are various answers to this question. One answer is that Muslim women often live in areas where having many children is seen as a blessing, and sometimes the only respite from hardships (Filipovic, Jill). Another reason is that like most major religions, the idea of using birth control is frowned upon (Todd, Douglas). Also, in Islam, like most major religions, it is encouraged, based on scripture, to have many children (Islam Question and Answer). But overall, it seems to be more about demographics than scripture when it comes to why Muslims are having so many children.\n\nIslam also has the benefit of having more female adherents of prime age to give birth than other religions. According to the Pew Research Center’s associate director of research and senior demographer Conrad Hackett, “Muslims are the youngest major religious group in the world. They have a median age of 24” (Here & Now). This is seven years younger than the median age of non-Muslims (Lipka, Michael, and Conrad Hackett).\n\nAnother demographic consideration for Islam’s exponential growth is that a large percentage of Muslims live in areas that are set to grow the most in the coming future. According to the Pew Research Center:\nMore than a third of Muslims are concentrated in Africa and the Middle East, regions that are projected to have the biggest population increases. But even within these high-growth regions – as well as others – Muslims are projected to grow faster than members of other groups. For example, Muslims in sub-Saharan Africa, on average, are younger and have higher fertility than the overall population of the region. In fact, Muslims are expected to grow as a percentage of every region except Latin America and the Caribbean, where relatively few Muslims live. (Lipka, Michael, and Conrad Hackett)\nThus, with few exceptions, Muslims have more children in most areas of the world than other religious groups, and people in general–especially in areas of high population growth.\n\nAnother major factor deals with religion switching. While Christianity is projected to lose 72 million believers between 2015 and 2060, Islam is set to lose as about as many practitioners as they gain in terms of religion switching (Lipka, Michael, and Conrad Hackett). Maybe one of the main reasons why Muslims do not defect from Islam often is that the punishment of apostasty, or the conscious abandonment of Islam, is severe. The majority of Islamic jurists believe the death penalty is fit for those that leave Islam (Omar, Abdul Rashied). Given this is the case, one can see why Muslims leave their religion less than other adherents of other religions.\n\nFor the picture of religious growth, Islam still claims the gauntlet. By most predictions, Islam will become the largest religion within 50 years, though Christianity is still growing at present. This is due to Muslim fertility rates, Muslims being of age to give birth on average more than other believers, Muslims having significant populations in areas where the most population growth is expected to happen, and favorable conditions in terms of religious switching as compared to other major religions. What will Islam’s dominance in the future mean for culture, the economy, and war? We can only wait and see.###"}
{"prompt":"How did the cultural phenomenon of Star Wars begin?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Star Wars is a phenomenon that is hard to quantify. It has enraptured the hearts of millions of people around the world, and the reasons are not always clear. Maybe it is the charismatic and dramatic vision of the future with all of its costumes, battles, relationships, and technology. Or, maybe it is simply that Star Wars came at a time with nothing like it had been seen before, and the enthusiasm for continued films in the series have been milked from this passion. Whatever the case, Star Wars had a unique beginning, and I would like to tell you about it in depth in the following paragraphs.\n\nGeorge Lucas, the creator of Star Wars, was a director with some fame before he showed his galactic feast to the public. With American Graffiti in 1973, Lucas gained notoriety as a director. Yet, it was only until his production of Star Wars was shown in 1977 that he truly became a household name.\n\nThe idea for Star Wars derived from various influences. Lucas has credited the film Hidden Fortresses by Akira Kurosawa as a great inspiration. According to Wookieepedia, “Lucas has said that the movie influenced him to tell the story of Star Wars from the viewpoint of the humble droids, rather than a major player. It also played a role in the conception of Darth Vader, whose trademark black helmet intentionally resembles a samurai helmet” (Wookieepedia). Lucas has also said that Star Wars began as a project to remake the Flash Gordon movie serials of the 1930s. When Lucas heard the license was not available, he moved onto to create an inspired work. The research of Joseph Campbell, especially in the form of the book The Hero With a Thousand Faces, also profoundly inspired Lucas to work on Star Wars (Wookieepedia).\n\nSo, with all these influences, in his second direction of Star Wars, he vied to use Flash Gordon vocabulary within a universe of futuristic samurai. With the third direction, the book The Hero With a Thousand Faces came into play. After writing two drafts of Star Wars, a reading of The Hero With a Thousand Faces aided Lucas in making his story more cohesive and expansive. In addition, Lucas has mentioned the influence of J.R.R Tolkien’s books and how the author handled myth with delicacy (Wookieepedia).\n\nGetting the money to direct such a film was not easy at the time. Gary Kurtz presented the film to Universal Pictures, but the executives did not take to it well, and wanted Lucas to work on more films like American Graffiti (Clarke, Gerald). Besides, science-fiction films were not the rage then, and Universal Pictures was not interested in squandering money. After Walt Disney Productions rejected it, finally in June of 1973, 20th Century Fox agreed to give $150,000 in order for Lucas to write and direct the film (Clarke, Gerald). However, eventually over 8 million dollars were approved for the cost of producing the film (Kurtz, Gary).\n\nWith a secured deal, Lucas put together a special-effects team called Industrial Light and Magic. Much of what the team was trying to create had not been done before for science-fiction films. According to Wookieepedia, “Since most major motion-picture companies no longer had special-effects teams, or they thought the American public was no longer interested in non-realistic films, George Lucas had to create one from scratch” (Wookieepedia). Finding actors was not all the simple either. Lucas searched for relatively-unknown actors. The most trying part was finding actors for the droids and other more fantastical characters. But by mid-1976, production on Star Wars began (Wookieepedia).\n\nThe filming started in Tunisia, North Africa, with temperatures reaching up to 105 Fahrenheit. Wookieepedia states that, “Through it all Alec Guinness, the Academy Award-winning actor who was cast as the wise mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, kept up a positive attitude and inspired the cast” (Wookieepedia). After the filming was finished in Africa, all the cast and crew went to Elstree Studios in London to film the Death Star sequences. However, there were many issues with the Industrial Lights and Magic team’s work, and soon 20th Century Fox was calling for the termination of the project. They gave Lucas a few weeks to finish the filming, and he and his crew worked tirelessly to finish before the deadline (Wookieepedia).\n\nThe editing of the film was somewhat of a nightmare. Lucas was appalled at the first shoot of the film and fired his editor. He demanded that some segments should be re-shot, and this forced the premier to be made in the summer of 1977 instead of in the Christmas of 1976. With the first showing of the film to Steven Spielberg, who enjoyed it, and Fox executives, who praised it, Lucas felt more confident about his film. This was despite having no score yet for the film yet. Spielberg recommended John Williams, who had made a epic score for the film Jaws. Apparently, epic scores were risky at the time, but Lucas felt comfortable in Spielberg’s opinion (Wookieepedia).\n\nOn the release day, Wednesday, May 25, 1977, it showed in fewer than 32 theaters. However, it quickly beat box office records, and Fox decided to expand its release (Kurtz, Gary). Lucas was largely skeptical that Star Wars would be successful, and so was Fox. However, it quickly became a cultural phenomenon. In fact, Star Wars essentially revamped 20th Century Fox, with its stock price skyrocketing. The lines to the film were many blocks long for many months, and the magic of Star Wars was born (American Heritage).\n\nInitially being a concept with a confluence of influences, George Lucas created Star Wars based on his passions. This love and care for its subject matter translated well into a film, which eventually became a global cultural phenomenon. Now that Disney is making Star Wars films each year, most people say the magic of Star Wars continues to this day.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the physiological reason for goosebumps?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Most people look at goosebumps, and think, “oh, there they are,” or something else unscientific. Do you ever wonder how goosebumps appear and why? Well, there are definite physiological reasons for this phenomenon, and in the following paragraphs, I will provide details about this extraordinary evolutionary trait.\n\nJust to get one thing clear: goosebumps are not of much use to us humans. According to George A. Bubenik, a professor of zoology at the University of Guelph in Ontario, “Goosebumps are a physiological phenomenon inherited from our animal ancestors, which was useful to them but are not of much help to us. Goosebumps are tiny elevations of the skin that resemble the skin of poultry after the feathers have been plucked. These bumps are caused by a contraction of miniature muscles that are attached to each hair” (Scientific American). So, essentially, they are happenings that aided poultry that have somehow been transferred to our genes. Like so many genetic traits of humans, goosebumps are almost entirely disposable—besides being indicators of sensations.\n\nProfessor Bubenik goes on to explain more about this physiological response. “Each contracting muscle creates a shallow depression on the skin surface, which causes the surrounding area to protrude. The contraction also causes the hair to stand up whenever the body feels cold. In animals with a thick hair coat, this rising of hair expands the layer of air that serves as insulation” (Scientific American). But, since humans do not have such a thick coat of hair, this response is rendered obsolete.\n\nThe main drive behind the phenomenon of goosebumps is emotion. Yes, goosebumps can be caused by a sudden chill in terms of temperature, but they can also as easily be caused by being frightened, being nostalgic, being excited by sound, and so on. Why is this? Professor Bubenik explains this:\nThe reason for all these responses is the subconscious release of a stress hormone called adrenaline. Adrenaline, which in humans is produced in two small bean-like glands that sit atop the kidneys, not only causes the contraction of skin muscles but also influences many other body reactions. In animals, this hormone is released when the animal is cold or facing a stressful situation, preparing the animal for flight-or-fight reaction. In humans, adrenaline is often released when we feel cold or afraid, but also if we are under stress and feel strong emotions, such as anger or excitement. Other signs of adrenaline release include tears, sweaty palms, trembling hands, an increase in blood pressure, a racing heart or the feeling of ‘butterflies’ in the stomach. (Scientific American)\nSimply put, goosebumps is a sign that adrenaline has been released in our body due to an response to stimuli. However, there might be more to this story.\n\nShould we ignore goosebumps because it is an evolutionary trait that is not that relevant to our current existence? I think we should still take goosebumps into consideration. Though it is a reflex action, getting ourselves in a flight or fight mode, we should take it seriously. Goosebumps can sometimes alert us to danger and prepare us for extreme measures. On the other hand, they can tell us what truly strikes a chord with us emotionally—though it may seem inexplicable at times (Wonderopolis). In fact, some scientists have studied the response to music and goosebumps and have concluded that this response is fueled by dopamine. With the release of dopamine, there are changes in our heart rate, breathing, temperature, and our skin’s electrical conductance. The pleasurability of music can be judged in large part to the presence of goosebumps (Nature Neuroscience).\n\nGoosebumps, as we have seen, is a rather strange evolutionary trait we have inherited from poultry. How we have been transferred this genetic strain is a mystery at the moment, but how goosebumps are produced is not so much of a puzzle. In accordance with scary, cold, or intense moments, the body produces adrenaline, and one of the physiological responses to this release is the phenomenon of goosebumps. In addition, when we listen to sound that is emotionally stirring, dopamine is released in our body, and we can also experience goosebumps during these moments. Though scientists generally believe goosebumps are practically useless in humans, they could be seen as indicators of what inspires us and what makes us most insecure. In this sense, goosebumps can be sign posts in the discovery of ourselves.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some ways to cope with road rage?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Driving is never easy. Every time you enter your vehicle and start the engine, you take on a great responsibility: for your own life and safety, and for the life and safety of pedestrians and other drivers. Perhaps, this is why many drivers feel psychological tension and pressure—especially considering that in big cities, they have to spend countless hours in traffic jams, seek for parking spaces all the time, be assaulted by polluted air, and so on. Sometimes all this stress may manifest itself in the form of bursts of anger; when these occur when a person is driving a car, this is called road rage. Unfortunately, road rage can be harmful—for the driver and the drivers nearby.\n\nRoad rage was first paid attention to in the end of 1980s, when there was a series of shootings on California highways; the term itself was coined by the anchors of KTLA TV channel, highlighting the incidents. Since that time, there have been thousands of reports regarding road rage. Unfortunately, this condition is not uncommon: anger can reach its peak in seconds, but its consequences can be dire. Perhaps, every driver knows the situation when, during a traffic jam, someone driving in front starts to change lanes, breaking all the rules, or when a pedestrian suddenly jumps out of nowhere right in front of a car. It is normal to feel annoyed in such cases, although, according to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, road rage is different; in particular, it is defined as “any unsafe driving maneuver performed deliberately and with ill intention or disregard for safety”: which means that road rage is a condition not necessarily provoked by the situation on the road, but rather the continuation of a driver’s ill temper, stressful life situation, poor anger management skills, and so on. One of the notorious cases of road rage happened in 2011, in Concord, N.H. A young woman, Corrine Leclair-Holler, 29, pregnant with a child, was driving down the road while talking on her cellphone. Another driver, Carissa Williams, driving nearby with her baby in the car, for no obvious reason, yelled at Corrine, then pulled ahead, stopped Corrine’s car, and shot her with a stun gun. Corrine cried that she was pregnant, but it did not stop the attacker. As a result, both Corrine and her baby are fine, and Carissa was sentenced to 20 years in prison for assault and endangering the life of a child (Web MD).\n\nThe trick is that when a person sits down in the car and starts the engine, he or she tends to perceive driving as their personal experience, and assumes other drivers on the road possess the same skills and responsibilities. However, this is a misconception: driving is a communal activity; so, since there is a number of people engaged, we need to consider that there are other drivers on the road as well—that each of them has his or her own goals, temper, driving skills and experience, and so on. According to Dr. Leon James and Dr. Diane Nahl, if we separate ourselves from the communal activity which driving is, we tend to perceive the actions of other drivers as a personal offense, as something disrupting our personal experience of driving a car—instead of seeing them as simple manifestations of other people’s skills. For example, if we are being cut off, we may feel like that driver has the purpose of doing it to us—although it might just be inexperience or inattention. With such an outlook, reacting with anger is natural, because our safety is violated, and anger is a natural response to danger—which does not mean, however, that the outlook itself is correct. Reacting with anger to other drivers’ maneuvers only escalates the situation, and does not help solve it. Besides, Dr. James believes that there are more reasons of why road rage is so widespread in the United States. One of them could be cultural habits; since childhood, people drive with their parents and witness how they react to everyday situations on the road, or what they do. Traffic light racing, driving at high speeds, cutting other drivers off—children memorize such behaviors, and reproduce them when they grow up. Another reason is that, according to Dr. James, the American mentality does not tolerate backing away, seeing it as cowardice. So, even if you did not start a conflict situation with another driver, you might feel that backing away (and thus avoiding further confrontation and possible harm) is not an option, and have to react with anger in response, thus only fueling the conflict (HowStuffWorks).\n\nChanging your mindset will help you avoid bursts of anger in the future, but what if you need to cope with road rage when it grips you? Fortunately, there are ways to decrease anger to a controllable and tolerable level, and thus prevent yourself from causing harm or being harmed. The first thing you need to do is to feel your anger. When indulging in road rage, drivers rarely notice their furious condition: they are  overwhelmed by the situation on the road, and are driven by their emotions (pun unintended). Surprisingly, simply noticing you are getting angry may help you maintain control over yourself; the signs of anger rising are clenched fists and teeth (as well as overall muscle tension), vengeful thoughts, cursing and speaking out loudly to other drivers even when they cannot hear you, headaches, and so on. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, know that you might be close to a road rage burst; take a deep breath, and try to focus on just getting from point A to point B. Imagine what might happen to you—all the negative consequences, from injury to jail—if you succumb to your anger. This way you will distract yourself from anger, and even if it does not go away completely, you will be aware of its presence, and will be able to hold it back (WikiHow).\n\nRoad rage is a condition that is dangerous for both who is angry, and for those whom this anger is directed against. Thousands of road rage incidents are reported from all across the United States annually. Road rage is believed to be the reaction to the situation on the road, which a driver perceives as a violation of his\/her personal driving experience and safety; this reaction includes performing dangerous driving maneuvers, cutting other drivers off, injuring or shooting them, and so on. There are ways to cope with rising anger while driving: slow deep breathing, focusing on the driving process, and staying aware of your anger should help in the majority of cases.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the factors that may lead a person to commit suicide?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" All people have periods in their lives when everything seems to go wrong. Hardships pile up, one misfortune follows another, resentment and frustration become too harsh to bear, and at some point, a person may feel that he or she cannot take it anymore. Every individual has his or her own coping strategies for such periods: some find relief in alcohol, others indulge in compulsive behaviors such as excessive shopping or eating, while some try to stay in one place and wait until the streak of failures runs to its end. However, there are people whose psyche, due to various reasons, is too fragile, or worn out, to be able to withstand hardships. If life hits them too hard, they might find no other choice than to commit suicide, in a radical attempt to solve all their problems at once—or, rather, to escape from them. However, life complications are not the only reason why people choose to kill themselves; in this essay, we are going to take a look at some of the factors pushing a person towards this fatal decision.\n\nPerhaps the first and foremost cause of suicide is depression. Due to the nature of this disease, people suffering from it often find living, performing everyday routines, working, having relationships, and so on, totally unbearable. Even the simplest actions require immense psychological effort, because one of the questions undermining the psyche of a depressed person sounds like, “What is the point in all this?” The lack of sense may be devastating; usually, every person can name at least one reason to continue living: family, duty, career, self-realization, art, their loved ones, and so on. For a depressed person, none of this matters. Instead, they delve into devastating thoughts such as, “Everyone would only be relieved if I am gone.” This is completely irrational, but such is the nature of depression: it makes a person believe he or she does not matter anymore, that his or her situation is hopeless and is never going to get better. Tired of constant mental suffering and the seeming fatuity of life, depressed people may continue living alongside with their relatives or friends, and plan suicide without anyone knowing about it (Psychology Today). Sometimes, people close to a depressed person may not even suspect that he or she is suffering from depression. If you suspect you or someone you know has this disease, or has suicidal intentions, it is important to remember—and let the person know—that depression is always curable, that there is a way out. Almost always, sincere support, care, attention, and psychotherapy combined with medical treatment flushes out depression.\n\nAlong with depression, there are several other mental illnesses that can lead a person to suicide. For example, bipolar personality disorder turns the life of a person suffering from it into an emotional roller coaster, the ups of which are always full of joy and activity, and the downs often make an individual indulge into severe episodes of alcohol and drug abuse, sexual escapades, and even suicide. Schizophrenia—one of the most severe mental illnesses known today—may significantly impair an individual’s ability to live a normal life, since hallucinations, accompanying depression, and cognitive dysfunctions often make it almost impossible to deal with everyday life situations; as a result, up to 40% of people with schizophrenia might have attempted suicide. Finally, mental disorders related to anxiety may also lead an individual towards contemplating suicide as an option. Generalized anxiety disorder, different forms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, various social phobias, and panic attacks may exhaust a person to such an extent that it may seem easier to take his or her life away than to make it through yet another day full of suffering (Mental Health Daily).\n\nYet another reason for suicide is an emotional impulse. You have probably seen this in movies: one of the characters goes through all kinds of misfortunes and failures, but still tries to hold on; finally, there is that one little thing that breaks him or her—a child gets an F on a paper, or the boss criticizes work done—and this character goes, “I cannot take it anymore,” grabs a gun, presses it against their temple, and pushes the trigger. In real life, cases like this can occur as well, but most often impulsive suicide occurs under the influence of drugs and\/or alcohol. When sober, a person may have no suicidal thoughts; but, when under the influence of substances, an individual may get an impulsive thought of killing himself or herself, and actually do it. Substance abuse, along with underlying psychological processes and certain traits of character, may cause this kind of suicide; so, if there have been signs of a person behaving recklessly when under the influence of alcohol, these signs should be addressed with all the appropriate attention (Kevin MD).\n\nSuicide attempts can often be a masked cry for help. Due to the peculiarities of upbringing and education, for some people, it may be difficult to ask for help directly. Rather often, such people try to indirectly hint at others about their needs, indulging into psychological manipulations. In some cases, a person may run out of such hints; desperately trying to draw attention to their feelings and problems, such people may find no better option than attempting to kill oneself. A classic example is a teenager suffering from bullying or unrequited love, or trying to keep romantic relationships from falling apart. “If you leave, I will kill myself, because life is not worth living without you”—this is not just a popular motive in all kinds of romantic movies and books (even Shakespeare described this behavior in his “Romeo and Juliet”), but also the message teenagers attempting suicide try to deliver to their loved ones, parents, peers, and so on. Sadly, such attempts often succeed, and even when they fail, they are often followed by health-related consequences (Kevin MD).\n\nThere are many other reasons why people commit suicide. Bullying and cyberbullying at schools (and sometimes in grown-up surroundings) may provoke suicidal thoughts; terminally-diseased patients suffering from cancer or other incurable illnesses causing severe pain may opt for suicide in order to get rid of it; PTSD, psychological traumas from childhood, repeated episodes of physical, sexual, and\/or emotional abuse may provoke the desire to kill oneself; existential crises and loneliness, financial problems, and genetics—these, as well as other factors, cause thousands of people all over the world to commit suicide. The list can go on and on; sometimes, even prescription medications can evoke suicidal thoughts and intentions: for example, it is well known that drugs used to treat depression may, at some point, cause suicidal desires—this is why it is strongly recommended to take them only under the supervision of a psychiatrist (Mental Health Daily).\n\nIt is crucial to know that suicidal thoughts, intentions, and tendencies are not a death sentence. Modern medicine—specifically, psychiatry and psychology—has an effective means of treating such psychological conditions. There is always a way out from any situation, even though a desperate and broken person may not be able to see it. Attention and care from friends and relatives, trust and a kind attitude, psychotherapy, carefully-prescribed medications, and time, are effective cures against depression and other factors leading to suicide. Mental disorders can be treated or coped with: even patients with schizophrenia—perhaps the most severe mental illness known nowadays—are able to live normal lives. Great examples of this are Cecilia McGough, Eleanor Longden, and many other women and men who have managed to learn how to coexist with their condition. They give lectures, create organizations supporting people with the same diagnosis, pursue their goals, and are no different from “normal” individuals. The same applies to bullying, financial problems, substance abuse, and many other issues: suicide is not the only way to overcome them. Even terminally-ill people may find comfort and peace of mind; many stories about this can be found on the Internet, and sometimes it is enough to look around to find such a person in your surrounding. Life, with all of its complications, miseries, and unfairness, is also full of joy, beauty, strong emotions, and happiness. With a little help, all of this is available to anyone.###"}
{"prompt":"What does it mean to be famous?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Your first guess for the most famous person of all time is probably correct: Jesus Christ, though Prophet Muhammad, Buddha, and John Lennon are close behind (Conger, Cristen). But how do we come upon this conclusion? What does it really mean to be famous? Let us explore these questions in the following paragraphs.\n\nBeing “famous” is more subjective than we usually think. Being famous can relate to being popular at a certain time and\/or for a particular reason. We all know the phrase “15 minutes of fame.” So, being famous should be defined, especially when it relates to history, as to how long someone has been famous, and to what degree that person has been famous during that span of time. Also, is the fame this person has universal, or specialized. For example, I am an enthusiastic haiku poet, and Matsuo Basho is undoubtedly the most famous haiku poet of all time. But he is not even within the top 1,000 most famous people in the world. Thus, ideally, the most famous person of all time should be the most popular not only by duration and degree within that duration, but also by universal appeal (Conger, Cristen).\n\nAstronomer Eric Schulman did a calculation of fame through similar methods. He looked at Google search hit numbers for certain individuals and viewed those numbers through the prism of longevity. So, although Donald Trump is now more popular on Google on Jesus, it is only a temporary fact. Jesus is still the most famous person throughout the history of humankind, at present (Manning, Allee).\n\nAlso, according to an analysis of Wikipedia metrics, Jesus still comes on top. Steven Skiena, a professor of computer science at Stony Brook University, New York, explained his method of determining how someone is famous through Wikipedia:\nWe analyse the Wikipedia pages of over 800,000 people to measure quantities that should correspond to historical significance. We would expect that more significant people should have longer Wikipedia pages than less notable folk, because they have greater accomplishments to report. The Wikipedia pages of people of higher significance should attract greater readership than those of lower significance. The elite should have pages linked to by other highly significant figures, meaning they should have a high PageRank, the measure of importance used by Google to identify important web pages. (Saul, Heather)\nIn terms of longevity being a factor, Skiena added: “An important aspect of our method is that we systematically decay the score of contemporary figures to reflect the loss from living memory which inevitably occurs over three to four generations. The significance of Jesus is shown by his mindshare today fully 2,000 years after his death. We don’t see the same happening for Justin Beiber” (Saul, Heather). This gives us insight into what it truly means to be famous, and not a fad.\n\nWhether you look at it from the angle of Google search hits or the metrics from the online juggernaut Wikipedia, Jesus is demonstrated as the most famous person of all time. Why someone is famous is not a factor, but rather how many times he or she is mentioned across the internet and the prominence of those mentions across an extended period of time. Unlike most statistical data, our first guess is probably correct when it comes to hypothesizing who the most famous person in history is.###"}
{"prompt":"How did the Internet come to be?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The Internet is a global phenomenon that has changed the way we communicate, do business, shop, and live our lives in general. However, most people, if they were asked about how the Internet works and its history, will not be able to give an accurate answer. In order to inform the general public about the beginnings of the Internet, I will detail its timeline in the following paragraphs.\n\nTo comprehend the creation of the Internet, we have to go back to the 1950s when electronic computers were first being developed. The concept of wide area networking began to form in computer science laboratories in the U.S., France, and England (Kim, Byung-Keun). But the real push to develop wide area networking came from the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1960s, with its ARPANET project, or The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. In 1969, the first message was sent with the use of ARPANET from computer science Professor Leonard Kleinrock’s laboratory at the University of California to the second network node at the Stanford Research Institute (Kim, Byung-Keun).\n\nAlongside this innovation were packet switching networks like NPL, ARPANET, Tymnet, Merit Network, CYCLADES, and Telenet. These networks were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, employing different communication protocols (Internet Society). Another significant event happened when Donald Davies, a Welsh computer scientist, presented packet switching in 1967 at the National Physics Laboratory in the U.K. (Yates, David).\n\nEventually, the ARPANET project led to the development of internetworking, which is the practice of connecting a computer network to many networks through gateways (essentially, a network layer) that uses routing information packets. So, the invention of network messaging and packet switching networks were integral to creating internetworking. And speaking of invention, the creation of the Internet protocol suite was developed by ARPANET staff alongside the French project CYCLADES directed by Louis Pouzin in the 1970s (Economist). So, like many other key inventions of humankind, the Internet was born from international roots.\n\nEven though the Internet protocol suite was invented in the 1970s, it took until 1986 for interconnectivity to be achieved with it. The NSFNET (National Science Foundation Network) project provided interconnectivity between supercomputer sites across the U.S. and between several U.S. universities. At this time, the Internet was employed for research and organizational purposes only (Link Letter).\n\nThe Internet began to be commercialized in the late 1980s when Internet service providers started to pop up. By late 1989, limited access to the Internet was being provided on private connections by commercial entities in American cities. With the decommission of ARPANET in 1990 and the decommission of NSFNET in 1995, there were no longer hurdles for the commercial use of the Internet (Indra.com).\n\nPerhaps the biggest game changer happened to the Internet with the introduction of the World Wide Web. Research done by British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee in the 1980s resulted in the World Wide Web, which linked hypertext documents into an information system (Couldry, Nick). This led to an even greater impact on the public, with the Internet affecting culture, commerce, communication, and technology. From the mid-1990s, the Internet became an integral part of world society. To demonstrate how profound the Internet has been in connecting the world, in 1993, the Internet was only transmitting 1% of two-way network information, but by 2007, the it represented 97% of all telecommunications (Science).\n\nStarting as a project of computer science researchers from various countries, and then from the U.S. Department of Defense in collaboration with many international organizations, the Internet began as a concept for quick communication for governmental and scientific use. But with the main organizing bodies for the Internet being eventually decommissioned, the commercial use of the Internet thrived first in U.S. cities and then it leaped across the world. Now, it is difficult to imagine living without it: much of our business, commerce, shopping, creative work, entertainment, education, communication, and research takes place on the Internet. But what is most fascinating is its limitless potential, and what it might bring to our nearest future.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the issues immigrants face when moving to a new country?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are many countries in the world where living conditions can be challenging to bear, to put it mildly. Citizens of developed countries such as the United States, Germany, Sweden, Japan, and so on often have little-to-no idea how difficult it is for millions of people all over the world to get through another day. Not even mentioning the African continent known mostly for its catastrophically-low life standards, poverty, and epidemics, there are many other places on the planet that are not easy to live in: the Middle East, Latin American countries such as Colombia, South-Eastern Asia, India, some countries of the former Soviet Union, and so on. Hunger, unemployment, poor sanitary conditions, corruption, wars and ethnic conflicts, piracy (meaning the real piracy, with robbery and murder, and not just downloading movies from torrent trackers)—these are only some of the problems that inhabitants of the poorer regions of the world have to go through on a daily basis.\n\nNaturally, at some point in their lives, many of these people start considering moving to more developed countries to find new economic opportunities, and hopefully find a better place for themselves and their families to live at. Rather often, people choose neighboring countries for immigration: for example, citizens of Tajikistan often immigrate to Russia, Koreans who manage to escape North Korea go to China or Japan, Latin Americans often shift over to the United States,  people from the Middle East immigrate to Europe, and so on. Immigration is a natural process, which under certain circumstances can be beneficial for both sides: immigrants can find a new, safer home, a job, and better living conditions, while hosting countries gain new workforce and new talents, as there are many talented and educated people among immigrants.\n\nThe downside of these processes is that immigration is never easy. Not only does a person have to abandon the environment he or she grew up in (and this means abandoning habitual cultural norms, social connections, familiar surroundings, and even family members sometimes), but also he or she has to face bureaucracy, uncertainty, all kinds of legal trouble, and sometimes xenophobia or racism. Being far from home, working twice as hard to make a living and somehow reinforcing their positions in a new country, immigrants may suffer from anxiety and depression for years. If an immigrant is illegally within a country, this fact may cause additional stress due to the risks of arrest, deportation, fines, and in general, because of having little-to-no rights.\n\nRather often, hardships begin even before a potential immigrant sets his or her feet on the land of his or her new home. For example, when immigrating to the United States under legal conditions, a person may have to wait in queues, since there are thousands of other people trying to do the same. This waiting may last for years, sometimes decades, as there are many bureaucratic formalities, all kinds of checks, and so on. The process, however, may be facilitated if an immigrant has a relative living in the United States. According to Rachel Wilson, an immigration attorney in Tucson, the United States immigration process can be frustrating because of the way immigration laws are set up. “Out there, there is this perception that there is a process you can easily go through to become legal, but let’s say you’re Mexican as an example, since most of the immigrants in Tucson are from Mexico. You decide you want to move to the U.S. for economic opportunity, but if you don’t have any family members here that will sponsor a visa for you, there is no way for them to come legally to the U.S. […] If you have an immediate relative who lives in the United States that is your spouse or a child over 21, then you can apply for a visa relatively quickly. It has to be your immediate relative and that person has to be a citizen. So then let’s say you have a spouse who is a legal permanent resident; then you have to get in line and wait probably three or four years. Or you go all the way down to the farthest relative away who can invite a person in, who is a brother or sister who is a citizen, and that line for Mexican citizens is long. There are different lines based on what country you are from. There are some countries that have extra long lines because the United States has determined that there are too many people from that country already,” says Wilson (Alternet).\n\nBureaucratic problems are not the only obstacles immigrants run into when moving to a new country. One of the most common issues almost every immigrant has to face sooner or later is a language barrier. Even for those who speak the language of the country they are moving to well, it may not be easy to settle in the new environment. Every language has dialects, accents, slang, phraseology, and so on; rather often, these nuances are impossible to learn if one is not living in the language environment, and in the best case scenario, future immigrants learn the foreign language back at home. So, when arriving to a new country and facing the “real” language, not the one taught in textbooks, an immigrant may feel discomfort and anxiety. Sooner or later, he or she will absorb the new knowledge, and will be able to understand people around them well. However, for immigrants who do not speak the language of the country they are moving to, or speak it poorly, things may get much harder. Language barriers increase the social isolation of an immigrant, disrupt his or her professional integration, cause severe stress, and make a person feel inferior to the citizens of the country they move to (lorricraig.com). Starting with trivial miscommunication, when an immigrant is unable to understand the speech of other people around them, and ending up with numerous hardships in personal and professional life, living without the knowledge of the language can be compared to being deaf and numb. In particular, such an immigrant cannot count on finding a more-or-less perspective job—he or she will be unable to write and submit a CV, not to mention passing interviews, filling in numerous blanks, documents, and so on. Receiving medical treatment, communicating with immigration departments, contacting authorities, buying food or even traversing a city: all this can be challenging if you cannot speak the language.\n\nYet another issue immigrants can face is discrimination. This conundrum is rarely considered by people for whom immigration may be the only chance for a normal life, but the sad truth is that newcomers in a hosting country may experience all kinds of prejudice and negative attitudes. In almost every country, there are people who have strong biases against the representatives of other cultures; although laws in developed countries protect all people regardless of their racial, ethnic, cultural, religious, or other background, a lot of immigrants face discrimination and infringement upon their rights on a daily basis. In particular, immigrants may face such an attitude when trying to find a job (potential employers may deny an immigrant of a position simply because they come from a different country), when moving to a new neighborhood (for instance, when a black person settles in a neighborhood traditionally inhabited by white people or vice versa), when addressing service agencies or schools (American Psychological Association). The latter is especially disappointing, since no prejudice or superstition can be a reasonable justification of denying children of their right to education. It is true that every job requires a certain educational level and language skills; however, rather often being an immigrant is enough for an employer to reject a person’s candidacy. Such an attitude causes a number of negative consequences for immigrants, starting with the inability to blend into a new society and become its fully-functioning member, and ending up with humiliation, disappointments and frustration, and feeling like a second-class person.\n\nPeople immigrate because of a number of reasons, the most common of which is seeking a better life in a new country. There are many disadvantaged regions in the world, and not all people living in these areas agree with their living conditions. Believing they deserve better, they choose to immigrate to more developed countries, often facing a number of issues. One of these problems is numerous bureaucratic procedures that one has to endure: people have to spend years in lines, waiting for immigration bureaus to analyze their cases and give them permission to enter a country they want to move to, and seek a job there. The second problem is a language barrier; even if an immigrant has skill in the language of the country where he or she is moving to, it may be difficult to accommodate and adapt to the new language environment; as for those immigrants who cannot speak the language, they cannot establish and maintain communication, and thus their lives in the new country become much more difficult. Finally, many immigrants face discrimination; even though modern societies declare open-mindedness and tolerance, in practice, racism and xenophobia are still flourishing. Respectively, when arriving to a new country, immigrants may experience difficulties in finding a job or settling in simply because of their background. As we can see, immigrants all over the world are a vulnerable social stratum, and thus need more protection.###"}

We can find countless stories dedicated to this subject not only in literature and cinema, but in real life as well—a lot of hotel keepers all over the world use ghost stories as a bait for trusting tourists. There is indeed something spooky about living in a room in which, as a tourist booklet states, there was a murder, or it is contended that the hotel is as eerie to stay at as the hotel in the book “The Shining.”###"}
{"prompt":"How did William Brooke O'Shaughnessy's research on cannabis in India contribute to the history of medicine?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In 1833, a twenty-four-year-old Edinburgh graduate arrived in India, an assistant surgeon in the East India Company. He had failed to acquire a license under the London College of Physicians and Surgeons, but had already established himself as an exciting young medical researcher, authoring an important paper on cholera following an outbreak in Europe. This man was William Brooke O’Shaughnessy, an Irish physician who would—over the next few years working in India—make significant contributions to the history of research in electricity, telegraphy, pottery, and, his primary discipline, medicine.\n\nThe colonial peripheries had no shortage of impressive polymaths, but what sets O’Shaughnessy apart is the manner in which, while conducting research in his many areas of interest, he not only tapped into elaborate local knowledge networks and structures, but also rigorously documented them, thoroughly crediting his sources both bibliographic and human. O’Shaughnessy also stands out on account of what was, arguably, his most significant contribution to medicine: the claim that cannabis could be used as a medicinal drug. As an intoxicant, cannabis was fairly common in India, as O’Shaughnessy noted, but he demonstrated its potential use in a medical context, particularly as an anaesthetic. The papers on his experiments with the plant were published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in late 1839—and were also read in front of the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta in October of that year. In them, we find detailed records of his prescient experiments, and a fine example of his unique style of research.\n\nHis first series of cannabis experiments were conducted on an unfortunate menagerie of animals (amongst others, fish, vultures, and storks) and also, perhaps not without controversy today, a few children—all subjected to various preparations and extracts of Cannabis Indica. The first experiment, for instance, involved administering “ten grains of Nipalese [sic] Churrus, dissolved in spirit” to a “middling sized dog”. O’Shaughnessy’s breathless notes read: “In about half an hour he became stupid and sleepy, dozing at intervals, starting up, wagging his tail as if extremely contented, he ate some food greedily, on being called to he staggered to and fro, and his face assumed a look of utter and helpless drunkenness.” 1\n\nO’Shaughnessy then proceeds to try variants of these initial treatments on a number of maladies. He describes the effect on four cases of patients suffering from rheumatism, a case of hydrophobia, on cholera and tetanus, before issuing a warning about the delirium that may be occasioned by inappropriate dosage. Some of the reports would not be out of place as descriptions of a merry stoner’s night in. One rheumatism sufferer, to whom “half a grain of Hemp resin was given in a little spirit … became talkative and musical, told several stories, and sang songs to a circle of highly delighted auditors, ate the dinner of two persons …, sought also for other luxuries I can scarcely venture to allude to, and finally fell soundly asleep, and so continued till the following morning”. Perhaps not unsurprisingly, the next day the patient, “begged hard for a repetition of the medicine”.2\n\nElsewhere, O’Shaughnessy describes a somewhat surreal episode in which a rheumatism patient administered with cannabis enters a state of “catalepsy”, whereupon his rigid limbs could be moved only with the help of medical staff, who could place them in “every imaginable attitude” where they would remain “no matter how contrary to the natural influence of gravity”—all the while the patient remaining completely “insensible”. The commotion of events ended up rousing a second patient, similarly dosed, who became “vastly amused at the statuelike attitudes” he witnessed, and then proceeded, after a sudden “loud peal of laughter” to exclaim that “four spirits were springing with his bed into the air”. After a subsequent “uncontrollable” fit of the giggles, this second patient then took up the strange condition of the first, his arms and legs “remain[ing] in any desired position”. Despite the slightly chaotic scenes, within a day or so, both patients were much relieved of their rheumatism, and in three days, completely cured.3\n\nInterestingly, it is while recording a failed treatment of hydrophobia that O’Shaughnessy notes one of the fundamental arguments for this medicine: even if it failed at curing the actual root of the illness, “at least one advantage was gained from the use of the remedy—the awful malady was stripped of its horrors”. If the illness was terminal, at least cannabis could enable the physician to “strew the path to the tomb with flowers”.4\n\nThe argument is not unfamiliar today, and indeed, in a prescient echo of more recent advocates of cannabis’ legalisation, O’Shaughnessy also downplays the drug’s supposed negative effects compared to other certain popular legal narcotics.\n\nAs to the evil sequelae so unanimously dwelt on by all writers, these did not appear to me so numerous, so immediate, or so formidable, as many that may be clearly traced to over-indulgence in other powerful stimulants or narcotics, viz. alcohol, opium, or tobacco.5\n\nThe interest of O’Shaughnessy’s medical students was also clearly piqued. He reports that several ended up experimenting on themselves and describes in detail one particular auto-experiment by a “retiring lad of excellent habits” which, twenty minutes after ingestion, led to the “most amusing effects I ever witnessed”:\n\nI found him enacting the part of a Raja giving orders to his courtiers; he could recognize none of his fellow students or acquaintances; all to his mind seemed as altered as his own condition; he spoke of many years having passed since his student’s days; described his teachers and friends with a piquancy which a dramatist would envy; detailed the adventures of an imaginary series of years, his travels, his attainment of wealth and power. He entered on discussions on religious, scientific, and political topics, with astonishing eloquence, and disclosed an extent of knowledge, reading, and a ready apposite wit, which those who knew him best were altogether unprepared for. For three hours and upwards he maintained the character he at first assumed, and with a degree of ease and dignity perfectly becoming his high situation. A scene more interesting it would be difficult to imagine. It terminated nearly as rapidly as it commenced, and no headache, sickness, or other unpleasant symptom followed the innocent excess.6###"}
{"prompt":"How did Facebook come to be the social media juggernaut that it is today?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Most internet users have a Facebook account, though most of these users do not know much about the exact origins and the development of their favorite social media platform. By understanding how Facebook came about and how it became as successful as it is now can enrich our experience as users. Thus, I will explain the details of Facebook’s beginnings and growth.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, a student at Harvard University, was in his second year of undergraduate studies. In that year, he opened Facesmash: a website that allowed users to compare college students’ attractiveness. Based on information from the newspaper Crimson (Kaplan, Katharine), Facemash employed “photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the “hotter” person.” Though the website fared well, it was shut down by the Harvard administration. Despite being taken down, Zuckerberg continued development on similar projects. One of these comparative projects was a face book for Harvard (Kincaid, Jason).\n\nIn 2004, noticing that Harvard had no online face book, or a student directory showing photos and information, and that Harvard was stalling on this project, Zuckerberg began writing code for “TheFacebook” in January of 2004. By February 4th, “thefacebook.com” was launched (Rothman, Lily). The intention behind the website was not only about showcasing data about students, but also to create a way for Harvard students to connect. According to Zuckerberg’s roommate, Dustin Moskovitz, “When Mark finished the site, he told a couple of friends … then one of them suggested putting it on the Kirkland House online mailing list, which was … three hundred people. By the end of the night, we were … actively watching the registration process. Within twenty-four hours, we had somewhere between twelve hundred and fifteen hundred registrants.” As one can you see, the demand for such a service was quite high.\n\nThough “TheFacebook” was an overnight success, only six days after the launching of the site, three Harvard students—Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra—sent out accusations that Zuckerberg created a rival to a site they were developing called “HarvardConnection” based on their accumulated data (Carlson, Nicolas). These students brought their complaint to the newspaper Crimson, and the newspaper launched an investigation. The end result was a lawsuit, which was eventually settled.\n\nThrough this tribulation and possible corruption of Zuckerberg, many users joined. In its first month of service, “TheFacebook” garnered more than half of the undergraduates at Harvard as users (Phillips, Sarah). With these numbers, Zuckerberg found associates to work with him, such as Eduardo Saverin (business aspects), Dustin Moskovitz (programmer), Andrew McCollum (graphic artist), and Chris Hughes (spokesmen). With the expanded team came an expanded audience: “TheFacebook” opened up to all Ivy League universities and Boston-area schools. From this initial push, it captured the attention of most of the schools in the U.S. and Canada (Rosmarin, Rachel).\n\nBy the end of the summer of 2004, it was incorporated, and Sean Parker, an adviser of Zuckerberg, became the company’s president. Not only did it move in terms of control, but also location. Palo Alto, California, became its new home. Another big event following this move was “TheFacebook” becoming “Facebook” after the team purchased the domain name “facebook.com” in 2005 for $200,000 (Williams, Chris). This domain change made a huge difference, as by December 2005, Facebook had 6 million users—and the rest is internet history.\n\nStarting from a Harvard dorm, Facebook began as an idea to integrate students and to make a universal tool for connection between internet users. From the brain of 23-year-old Zuckerberg (and others, evidently), Facebook has grown to encompass a culture that reaches far beyond its collegiate beginnings. Somehow, Facebook has weathered the storm of competition from other social media platforms, and who knows how it will affect our future as bright and bleak as ours.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the causes and effects of insomnia?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" How often in your life have you been in a condition when you are deadly tired and dream only about getting in your warm bed—to find yourself completely unable to fall asleep? An hour, two hours, three hours in a row you lie, tossing from side to side. Your bed has suddenly become too hot or uncomfortable, and the feverish thought train rushes through your mind; you are tired and angry, because you have got less and less time before you will need to get up and go to work again, and you start to suspect that this night, all your effort to fall asleep will be in vain. Finally, after five hours of useless torture, desperate, you get up and go to the kitchen to make yourself a strong cup of coffee, hoping that it will help you hold on for another day.\n\nThis is what an episode of insomnia looks like. All people get moments like this at least once in their lives due to excessive stress—fatigue (extreme tiredness, although it might seem paradoxical, can lead to insomnia episodes), anxiety, excitement, or other factors—it may be difficult or impossible to fall asleep every once in awhile. However, imagine a life when every night resembles the situation described above; imagine how an exhausted, nervous, haggard man or woman approaches his or her bed hoping that this time, he or she will finally be able to have some rest—only to spend yet another night awake, occasionally grabbing an hour or two of shallow, restless sleep. As morbid as it sounds, this condition has become a major problem for millions of people all over the world. Insomnia, along with chronic depression, has become one of the most common psychological disorders of modernity.\n\nSo, what is insomnia exactly? To start with, specialists distinguish between chronic and acute insomnia. Acute insomnia does not necessarily mean some kind of a psychological problem; it mostly occurs due to life circumstances, or stress caused by them: exams, moving to a new place, the first week at work, divorce, marriage, jet lag, singular episodes of fatigue, and so on. Acute insomnia is usually short-term, and can last from one or two days, to a couple of weeks. Chronic insomnia, in its turn, is a repetitive condition of disrupted sleep, which occurs at least three times in a week within a duration of several months. This type of insomnia is more “heavy-weight,” and may be caused by such factors as unhealthy sleep habits, working in shifts for prolonged periods of time (for instance, factory workers or medical staff working at night and having to sleep during the daytime are in the group of risk), the side effects of medications, or chronic disorders, both physical and psychological (National Sleep Foundation). Some specialists also speak of transient insomnia: rare episodes of disrupted sleep that last less than three nights in a week, and do not tend to repeat (Medical News Today). Along with this classification, sleep specialists also talk about primary and secondary insomnia: the former implying that insomnia is a standalone condition not caused by other factors, and the latter meaning that disrupted sleep is caused by an external factor of some kind (WebMD). In particular, these factors can include nasal allergies, gastrointestinal and endocrine problems, arthritis, and other health conditions causing chronic pain, Parkinson’s disease, asthma, and a number of neurological conditions (National Sleep Foundation).\n\nSo, how does insomnia manifest itself? Most people tend to believe that insomnia is the complete inability to sleep (as in the famous movie “The Machinist” with Christian Bale). However, it is a proven fact that anyone who is deprived of sleep for the duration of 11 days maximum has strong chances to lose his or her mind or even die of exhaustion. Sleep is an important function of our bodies, allowing us to replenish energy, structuring our perception and cognitive processes, and restoring our health. Insomnia is a deprivation of sleep, not its complete absence.  Although there may be nights when a person with insomnia is unable to fall asleep, symptoms of insomnia, in general, include intense bouts of sleepiness during the daytime, irritability, the inability to focus on daily tasks or memorize information, and an overall fatigue that does not go away even after sleep (WebMD). And, of course, one should mention sleep disruptions such as the inability to fall asleep, waking up in the middle of the night or much earlier than planned, headaches, and (the cherry on the cake) the fear of sleep (Mayo Clinic). The latter can be explained in different ways, but most likely, this fear is caused not by the sleep itself, but by a person’s expectations about not being able to have a good sleep again. Or, in case a person suffers from the hypnagogic hallucinations (a common phenomena, typical even for healthy people; during hypnagogic hallucinations, a person may hear voices right before falling asleep or after waking up, or experience similar symptoms), he or she may feel afraid of them, and thus avoid falling asleep as long as possible.\n\nAnyways, insomnia is a difficult condition that requires treatment. Nowadays, it is popular among doctors to prescribe pills, helping people with insomnia to fall asleep. However, as usual in cases of psychological and neurological conditions, pills alone cannot be considered a fully adequate treatment. If a person suffers from acute insomnia, relaxation techniques, meditation, walking, hiking, sports, and well-adjusted daily rhythms can help immensely; however, if insomnia is chronic, the aid of a psychotherapist or a psychiatrist might be required, since it is important to figure out whether insomnia has or has not been caused by depression, anxiety disorder, or other dangerous conditions.\n\nInsomnia is a condition during which a person experiences the inability to maintain long, restful sleep. It is not only about sleeping for a short period of time, or waking up often, but also about experiencing fatigue and exhaustion during the daytime, being unable to concentrate and function normally, and feeling irritated and depressed. Repeated episodes of insomnia should be discussed with your local sleep therapist, psychotherapist, or psychiatrist, because relying on sleep pills do not prove to be fully effective in the matter of treating this unpleasant and dangerous condition.###"}
{"prompt":"What was the Black Death, and how did it affect Europe?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Our age is the age of health. Though humanity still battles such terminal diseases as AIDS, cancer, and ever-mutating strains of exotic types of flu, in general, people live longer and healthier than even a hundred years ago. And perhaps it is even fair to say that throughout the recent centuries, humanity has never been taken to the brink of extinction by any kind of sickness—smallpox, cholera, typhus, or any other. Even though the body count of some of the diseases that ravaged the world not so long ago was terrifying (for instance, cholera pandemic in Russia, in the 19th century, killed more than one million people; or, the infamous Spanish flu virus, which took the lives of about 75 million people all over the world in the beginning of the 20th century), humanity always managed to find a way to withstand and survive. However, once upon a time, there was a disease that could be called God’s wrath; a disease that could have erased (and almost did) entire nations once and for all. Its name is still well-known, and even though nowadays the danger of its repeated outbreak are null—at least in developed countries—its ghost is still able to scare historians, medics, and all the enthusiasts digging up facts about it. The name of this disaster is the Black Death.\n\nTo start with, it is not exactly the plague, as many people tend to believe. The name of this disease in Latin is Yersinia Pestis, and it can manifest itself in a number of symptoms when infecting humans. The three main forms Yersinia Pestis takes are pneumonia, bubonic plague, and septicemic plague. It is a coccobacillus commonly carried by fleas living in rat fur, and is typically transmitted to humans through flea bites. Usually, an infected person develops pneumonia, and thus transmits the disease further; urban environments can be especially vulnerable to this way of contamination. As scary as it may sound, the World Health Organization registers thousands of cases of Yersinia Pestis infection worldwide, so this disease is not something left far behind. However, considering the modern ways of treatment and the overall level of hygiene, nowadays being infected with this bacillus does not automatically mean a death sentence, and the prognosis for patients are generally optimistic (Wikipedia).\n\nThe Black Death terrorized Eurasia long ago; if we take a look at the modern European Union, we will expectedly discover high standards of living, developed medicine, an educated population, and advanced hygiene and sanitary conditions almost everywhere. However, in the 14th century, Europe was almost completely opposite to what it is today. Due to poverty, a lack of education, and all kinds of superstitions, many people washed their hands and bodies so seldom that it was a hothouse, so to say, for not just the Black Death, but for other serious diseases as well.\n\nEven kings and rich people were unaware of the importance of keeping their bodies and environments clean. Perhaps, everyone knows how and why perfumes were invented: to mask the unpleasant smell of King Louis XIV; even though he lived long after the Black Death took its death toll, he still shared the superstitions of Medieval people about bathing (The Perfume Society).\n\nThere are objective reasons explaining why ancient Europeans avoided water, but it is not relevant to the subject at hand; what is important now is that sanitary conditions in Europe of the 14th century were morbid. Besides, European cities and villages swarmed with pests—rats, in particular. Supposedly, rats were so common that no one paid attention to them. As we can see, considering the ways Yersinia Pestis infects its hosts, Medieval Europe provided all the commodities for it to flourish. And it did.\n\nIt all started in 1334, in China; through major trade routes, the Black Death traveled to Constantinople (most likely on merchant ships), from which it quickly spread across Europe. Historians claim that the European “part” of its death harvest started in 1346 and lasted until 1350—four years of the pandemic took the lives of more than 200 million people in Europe, Asia, and even North Africa. It is often stated that the Black Death eradicated up to one-third of the European population, although the truth is that it is difficult to estimate this number correctly. Indeed, in some areas, rural and urban, the disease eliminated approximately 70 percent of population—for example, in Cambridgeshire, or supposedly in Florence. However, there were places which the plague omitted completely, such as the northern German-speaking lands. Considering the unsatisfactory preservation of a number of historical records drawn up at that time, it is difficult to state how many European died exactly (History Extra).\n\nStill, regardless of this, the pandemic was no doubt horrible. A Florentine chronicler wrote that,\n“All the citizens did little else except to carry dead bodies to be buried […] At every church they dug deep pits down to the water-table; and thus those who were poor who died during the night were bundled up quickly and thrown into the pit. In the morning when a large number of bodies were found in the pit, they took some earth and shovelled it down on top of them; and later others were placed on top of them and then another layer of earth, just as one makes lasagne with layers of pasta and cheese.” Another chronicler, Agnolo di Tura ‘the Fat,’ who lived in Tuscany, described how the dead were buried: “… in many places in Siena great pits were dug and piled deep with the multitude of dead […] And there were also those who were so sparsely covered with earth that the dogs dragged them forth and devoured many bodies throughout the city” (History Today). There was no cure for the plague in the 14th century, and medicinal research could not be conducted, since the Church did not approve of it; so, all people could do was to bury and burn the bodies of the dead.\n\nOmitting all the grim details, the plague came to its end in approximately 1350-1352. It is possible for a contagious disease to kill all of its hosts quicker than it manages to find new ones, and in this case, the sickness “burns out,” metaphorically speaking. Perhaps, this is what happened to the Black Death, because there was no cure for it at that time. It would be tempting to say that never again did it raise its ugly head, but this would not be true: history shows several other outbreaks of Yersinia Pestis—not so severe and wide-scale, but deadly nonetheless. For now, humanity has other enemies to fight, and hopefully the Black Death will never enter their lists once again.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some methods that can help to replenish creativity?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One of the most valued traits that a modern employee should possess is creativity. A huge number of companies describing their perfect candidate in job vacancies point out creativity as a necessary quality, even if the job itself is not directly related to “creative professions.” For example, creativity may be required from all kinds of managers, SEO specialists, marketers, or even salesmen. Such a high demand for this quality can be explained with the broadness of the term: creativity does not necessarily mean the ability to create unique content; in a more general interpretation, it can be understood as the ability to solve problems and approach challenges in a non-standard way—and, from this perspective, it is indeed something any specialist should possess if he or she wants to be able to withstand competition.\n\nIt is also fair to speak of creativity as a kind of depletable psychological resource, somewhat similar to emotional or mental resources. When it is sufficient, it is perceived as something constant; when being in a resourceful condition, designers, for example, can come up with memorable and unique brand identities; copywriters can write persuasive and engaging sales write-ups and advertisements; painters and sculptors can create masterpieces, and managers can efficiently perform their daily tasks, looking out for new and fruitful ways of fulfilling their duties. However, as in the case of any other resource, creativity may exhaust; in this regard, we speak of the dreaded “burning out,” when even the simplest and the most routine tasks appear to be extremely difficult or even impossible to do. The good news is that creativity can be replenished, and even in a burnt out condition, a person can remain efficient and productive, using certain creative techniques.\n\nEveryone has heard of brainstorming. It is a great method, but it works well only when there is a number of people thinking over the same issue; however, a more common situation implies working on a problem alone. In this case, one might want to use the mind-mapping technique. It is rather simple, and its main goal is to push one’s tired mind over the limits of mundane thinking. All you need to break through your creative block is a sheet of paper and a pen. Let us suppose you are a designer working on a logo for a start-up, feeling completely stuck on the most basic versions. First of all, you need to write down the keywords related to the subject you are working on. For example, if you must draw a logo for a company producing orange-soda, write down the most obvious words describing this product; let these words be, “orange,” “soda,” “drink,” “cold,” “summer,” “refreshing,” and “sweet.” Now, for each of these words, you must find several associations: more is better, but at least three or four will suffice. For instance, “orange” may be associated with “color,” “sun,” “evening,” “tropics,” and “sphere.” “Soda,” in its turn, may be associated with “bubbles,” “gurgling,” “sizzle,” “tin can,” and “holiday.” These are the associations of the first level, and your task is to move deeper, to the second and third levels at least. To do this, for each association you wrote down, you must create several more associations: “color” may be connected to such words as “bright,” “pigment,” “painting,” “Mark Rothko,” and “sketch”; “sun,” in its turn, can be expanded to “stars,” “solar system,” “hot,” “orbit,” and “meadow.” These associations do not need to be nouns; you can write down adjectives, actions, emotions, song names—whatever comes to your head. If you keep doing this, rather soon your sheet of paper will be covered with a huge number of words, each of which is related to “orange soda” in some way. What you need to do now is to explore the possible combinations of these associations—phrases you make up this way may sound weird (“sizzling tropics” or “orange universe,” for example), but they will give you new ideas. And this is what a creativity technique is meant for, right? Mind-mapping works for any problem you are working on—so, you can be a lawyer or a plumber, and still use it to your advantage (Lifehacker).\n\nThe next method you can use is called “Six Thinking Hats.” Its main purpose is to allow you to look at a problem from different angles, and it is a blessing for those who feel like bashing one’s head against a wall, trying to find new approaches to routine issues. It works well for both collectives of people and hardworking singletons, and its main idea is that you must “try on” six different “hats,” each of which represents a separate style of thinking. The hats are white, black, red, green, yellow, and blue. Wearing the white hat implies addressing the data you currently possess. Revise the information you have on the problem, analyze it, and figure out what else there could be that you do not know yet; fill the gaps in with your knowledge about the problem. The yellow hat means a positive outlook—your task when wearing it is to find all possible ways to solve a problem. Even if it is naive or not too realistic, it still counts. The main goal of this hat is to show you the strongest points of your solution. Then there is the black hat, which is the direct opposite of the yellow one: while wearing it, you must seek all the reasons why the solution in question will not work, thus spotting your plan’s weaknesses. The red hat implies emotional analysis: pay attention to your gut feelings, intuition, or emotional reactions to the problem and its solutions; it is irrational, but sometimes positions like “I have a bad feeling about this” can be the most solid pro or contra arguments. The green hat thinking process somewhat resembles the brainstorming technique; it implies that you express any idea on the subject that comes to your mind: irrational, strange, obviously ineffective, and so on. While wearing the green hat, you must turn off your critical thinking, and allow yourself to be as creative as possible. Free-flowing associations work well for this hat. Finally, the blue hat means process control, and is especially useful when applying the “Six Thinking Hats” methods in groups. The blue hat wearer observes the process of generating ideas, and directs it. For example, when the blue hat sees that the green hat is running out of new ideas, he or she may give it a break, and address the red hat. “Six thinking hats” can be viewed as a structured and moderated version of brainstorming, with the participants having a right to criticize or advocate ideas (MindTools).\n\nThe methods described above are powerful and effective ways of getting out of creative dead-ends. Mind-mapping allows you to push yourself through the block caused by the lack of new ideas by piling up associations; these associations serve as “food” for our brains, and our minds work in such a way that even when we cannot consciously come up with a new idea, they will automatically “digest” the food you feed to them, and produce new combinations, thoughts, and images. “Six Thinking Hats,” in their turn, are effective when you need to evaluate the results of your work, make a decision, come up with a strategy, or generate ideas. This method structures the thinking process by dividing it into such categories as critical thinking, positive thinking, emotional reactions, free-flowing creative processes, and data analysis, thus helping a person think more purposefully and effectively. There are many other creative methods out there as well; use them to your advantage, and you will be able to get through any obstacle that gets in the path of your creativity.###"}
{"prompt":"How did George Mallory and Andrew Irvine disappear on their attempt to climb Mount Everest in 1924?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There is a popular phrase used by alpinists when asked about why they have chosen to climb mountains: “Because they exist.” If you think this phrase over, you will discover an underlying layer of meanings and motives which perhaps cannot be explained better than in these three words; there is challenge, danger, pushing oneself to the limit, a desire of fame, an adrenaline rush, the testing and the exploring of an alpinist’s capabilities, the feeling of standing on the world’s rooftop…. The reasons are many, and there is probably no other mountain that would give alpinists all of them—and much more—than Everest. Since the day it was discovered, Everest (or Chomolungma, as it is called in the language of sherpas—people living in the Nepalese highlands) stimulated the minds of thousands of climbers all over the world. Being the highest mountain on the planet, Everest has been explored and climbed dozens of times, but history will always remember those who did it first: Andrew Irvine, George Mallory, Edmund Hillary, and Tenzing Norgay.\n\nIn fact, speaking of Irvine and Mallory, it is not entirely clear whether they managed to reach the top of Everest. The history of their climb remains a mystery even today, although many researchers believe, based on numerous interviews, archival materials, and meticulous data analysis, that Irvine and Mallory did climb to Everest’s summit. But, let us get things in order. George Mallory and Andrew Irvine were members of the British expedition to mount Everest that started in 1924. The goal of the expedition was to ascend the mountain, and it was the second expedition pursuing such a goal. During the expedition, there were two attempts to get to the top, but both of them failed. During the third attempt, both Irvine and Mallory disappeared. There were witnesses claiming to have had seen them ascending, not too far from the summit (the testimonies, provided by the geologist Noel O’dell, were confusing and controversial, and the mountaineer himself could not unequivocally explain what exactly he had seen), but neither Mallory, nor Irvine returned to the alpinists’ camp. And since 1924, there have been a lot of assumptions, versions, and debates about whether Mallory and Irvine managed to reach the top or not. If yes, it would have been the first successful ascendance on Everest, 30 years before Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgey did so.\n\nIn 1999, a specially-commissioned expedition found George Mallory’s body. It was extremely well preserved, and was lying on the mountain’s northern slope at the height of 8,160 meters; Andrew Irvine’s body has not been found yet. The doubts surrounding the mountaineers success are fueled by the fact that the weather on the day when they set out to the summit was extremely bad—they were last seen vanishing into the clouds on Everest’s Northeast Ridge. According to Professor Kent Moore of the physics department at the University of Toronto, “The disappearance of Mallory and Irvine is one of the most enduring mysteries of the 20th century, yet throughout the debates surrounding their disappearance, the issue of the weather has never really been addressed […] We analysed the barometric pressure measurements and found out that during the Mallory and Irvine summit attempt, there was a drop in barometric pressure at base camp of approximately 18mbar. This is quite a large drop, in comparison the deadly 1996 ‘Into Thin Air’ storm had a pressure drop at the summit of approximately 8 mbar.” Moore and his team believe that this means Mallory and Irvine must have had to fight a terrible storm on their way to the summit (Telegraph.co.uk), which casts doubt on whether they—unlike many people believe—climbed to the top of Everest.\n\nAfter numerous attempts made throughout the following years, a team of two brave mountaineers—Edmund Hillary (New Zealand) and Tenzing Norgay (Nepal) did ascend the top of Chomolungma. It happened on May 29, 1953, just a couple of days before Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation. The expedition they participated in was huge: with tons of supplies and 370 sherpas (sherpas always escort the mountaineers from other countries and do the most dangerous work all the way up to the summit of Everest), it was gathered with just one goal: to climb to the top, although the vanguard (pairs of mountaineers who would attempt to reach the top of the mountain) was just 10 people. According to George Band, 73, who was a member of the expedition, “The basic plan was for two summit attempts, each by a pair of climbers, with a possible third assault if necessary. On such expeditions, the leader tends to designate the summit pairs quite late during the expedition, when he sees how everybody is performing.” One of such pairs were Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay—a beekeeper, first time in the Himalayan mountains, and a 38-year-old lead sherpa, a veteran of Everest expeditions, who managed to do what seemed to be impossible. After reaching the South Summit—which is almost the top of the mountain—by 9 a.m. on May 29th, Hillary and Tenzing had to face one final obstacle: a rocky 12-meter spur, now known as the Hillary Step. These 12 meters were perhaps the longest distance in the mountaineers’ lives: it took them almost two and a half hours to bypass it; the pair reached the top at 11:30 a.m. They spent little time at the summit—approximately 15 minutes, and then descended back to the last camp. Later, Hillary wrote: “Inevitably my thoughts turned to Mallory and Irvine. With little hope I looked around for some sign that they had reached the summit, but could see nothing” (National Geographic).\n\nRegardless of who was the first to reach the top of Everest and how many people did it afterwards, each ascendance to the world’s rooftop is a heroic deed. Such height is a death zone for people due to the lack of oxygen in the air, sudden storms, extreme subzero temperatures, and winds. People reaching such heights may experience hallucinations, severe fatigue, they may feel unbearable heat and take off their clothes (although it sounds odd, this is one of the common illusions mountaineers suffer on Everest), oxygen starvation, and other symptoms, many of which lead to death. Even nowadays, when expeditions have advanced alpinistic equipment and safety measures, there are years when Everest encounters many deaths—as it happened in 1996 during one of the most tragic expeditions in the history of alpinism; thinking of the conditions in which Mallory and Irvine, as well as Hillary and Tenzing, attempted their ascendance, it is difficult to not admire their courage and persistence.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some interesting facts about John Adams?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" John Adams (1735-1826) was the second president of the United States. But how much does an average person know about him? In the following paragraphs, we will explore his early years, his involvement in the American Revolution, his diplomatic missions to Europe, his presidency, and his writings.\n\nThe second president was born in Massachusetts in the city of Braintree (now Quincey) on October 30th, 1735 to John and Susanna Boylston Adams. He was the eldest of three sons, and his father was a shoemaker and farmer who was also a congregational deacon and a part of the local government (History).\n\nYoung Adams was an excellent student and graduated from Harvard College in 1755. After graduating, he was a teacher for numerous years, while also studying law with an attorney in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1758, Adams started his law career, and rose through the ranks to become a well-known attorney (History).\n\nEvery successful man has got to marry, as they say. Adams got married to Abigail Smith (1744-1818) in 1764. She was a minister’s daughter, and they eventually had six children together. Through letters sent back and forth between the couple while Adams was travelling in Europe, it is known that Abigail was a prudent adviser of Adams and that she shaped his career (History).\n\nAdams was an early challenger of British rule over colonial America. He saw how the British imposed taxes and tariffs as oppression, and concluded that America should stand on its own. He was an outspoken critic of the Stamp Act in 1765, which forced a tax on legal documents, newspapers, and playing cards. In addition, Adams was against the Townshend Acts of 1767, which imposed tariffs on various goods that were imported to America (History).\n\nFast forward to 1774, and Adams was a delegate in the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. In the following year, Adams was also a delegate for the Continental Congress, and he nominated George Washington to be the commander of the colonial forces in the American Revolutionary War (1775-83). Also important, as a delegate, he nominated Thomas Jefferson to draft the Declaration of Independence (History).\n\nStarting from 1778, Adams was sent to Paris to retrieve aid for the colonists. In the next year, he came back to America to work on the Massachusetts Constitution, which some say is the oldest surviving constitution that is written down. Another highlight of his diplomatic career was in 1783, when he helped to negotiate the Treaty of Paris, which put in paper the end of the attacks between U.S. and British forces. Backtracking a bit, Adams also served as the American minister to France in 1776 (History). Another key note in his resume is that he was the first ambassador to Britain, from 1785 to 1788.\n\nAfter coming back to America after his role as ambassador to Britain had ended, he nominated George Washington to be the first U.S. president. Furthermore, he lobbied to be the first vice president, as in those times, the race for president and vice president was done separately. However, Adams did little from 1789 to 1797, and noted that the role of vice president was mostly ceremonial. Yet, when Washington retired in 1796, Adams vied for the presidency and won against Thomas Jefferson, who in turn became the vice president (History).\n\nUnlike Washington, who was not concerned about foreign affairs, Adams’ presidency began in March of 1797 with issues with foreign powers. In particular, American trade was getting affected by the war between France and Britain. Though Adams sent a delegation to France in 1797, France refused to see them and instead asked for a huge bribe. Adams declined to pay the bribe, and from this act, Adams’ popularity as president grew. However, tensions between France and the U.S. expanded, and a naval war between the two countries went on for two years starting from 1798. A peace treaty was signed on 1800, though (History).\n\nIn the last portion of his presidency, he passed controversial acts called the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798. They were laws that demanded enemy aliens to be deported and that allowed people who showed signs of vehemently disagreeing with the government to be arrested. Thomas Jefferson, and people tied to him, strongly attacked the law, and so did the general population. They feared they were going to be put under the grip of another oppressive government. This cost Adams his reelection in 1800 (History).\n\nFollowing Adams’ presidency, he wrote many books, articles, and letters for the next 25 years. Though his wife died in 1818, he saw his son, John Quincy Adams, rise to the presidency in 1824.  John Adams passed away on July 4th, 1826, with these last words, “Thomas Jefferson still survives,” not knowing that Jefferson passed away earlier that morning (History).\n\nNow that you know his basic timeline, here are some interesting facts about his life that is not well-known. During the Boston Massacre in March of 1770, Adams represented the British soldiers who murdered five colonists as an attorney to ensure that they would receive a fair trial. Another interesting point is that Adams had written over 1,000 letters, which are preserved to this day. Many of them are written to his wife, however many are also written to Thomas Jefferson, who was his rival, but they later started to communicating regularly in their senior years. Of further interest, Adams was the first president to live in the White House, as it was not built yet in George Washington’s time (History Stories).\n\nI hope this has been an intriguing and informative look into America’s second president. His political career was controversial, but with his principled actions and no-nonsense approach to foreign policy, he paved great roads into the American way as we know it today.###"}
{"prompt":"How did George Washington's childhood shape him into the man he became?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" We know him as the first president of the United States, and as an honored general, but what else should we know about him? I think it is important to discuss his early life, what led up to his appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, and his life as the first U.S. president.\n\nGeorge Washington (no middle name, as they were not used until the early 19th century) was born in Virginia on February 22, 1732 into a middle-class family, being the eldest of six children of Augustine and Mary Washington. His father built the plantation house George lived in in the 1720s. However, his father died when George was 11 years old, and he inherited the plantation, along with ten slaves (Mount Vernon). Not much is known factually about the first president’s childhood, but what is known for sure is that between the ages of seven and fifteen, he was home schooled and studied with a church sexton and then a schoolmaster for math, geography, Latin, and English classics. He was said to have learned much from backwoodsmen and a plantation foreman. In his teens, he became an expert in growing tobacco, stock raising, and surveying (Biography).\n\nThough George was proud of his farming abilities, and eventually took over all of the Washington estate when his brother, Lawrence, died of tuberculosis in 1752, he was appointed as a major in the Virginia militia after having experience as an official surveyor (Biography). Being given the position of major without previous military experience attests to his leadership skills and natural physical ability. He fought in the French and Indian War, and was so successful as a major that he was eventually given the position to lead the entire militia of Virginia. But it almost seemed like his military exploits were at an end when he resigned, and returned his hometown, being elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses until 1774 (History).\n\nHis life seemed to be settling down. He married a wealthy widow with two children, Martha Dandridge Custis (1731-1802), and extended his land from 2,000 acres to an 8,000 acres plot with five farms. He had corn, wheat, and fruit grown on his plantation; in addition, he bred mules and had a lucrative fishery. But by the late 1760s, with the rising taxes set on Americans by the British, he was engrossed in the effort to declare independence from England. He became a delegate to the First Continental Congress in 1774 in Philadelphia, and by the time the second Continental Congress convened, he was appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army (History).\n\nIt is said that despite his troops having a lack of supplies and being poorly trained, his main quality was inspiring optimism in the face of defeat. He is credited to holding together the Continental Army through the grueling eight years of the Revolutionary War. Having a stalemate for many years, by October of 1781, with the aid of French allied troops, the Continental Army captured many troops under British general Charles Cornwallis (1738-1805). This victory ensured the end of the Revolutionary War. Subsequently, George was heralded as a national hero (History).\n\nWith a peace treaty between Great Britain and the U.S. signed in 1783, Washington went back to Mount Vernon to do his duty as a farmer. But when, in 1787, he was sent to attend a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and be the leader of the committee to create a new constitution, his leadership was noted once again. The delegates believed he was the most suitable man for the job of America’s first president (History).\n\nHe was rather reluctant about being appointed to this demanding post, as he wanted to resume a quiet life as a farmer. However, public demand for him being the first president was so overwhelming that he eventually gave into the opinion of the masses. The first U.S. presidential election was in 1789, and he won in a landslide, his closest rival being John Adams. A 57-year-old Washington was inaugurated as president on April 30, 1789 in New York City, as the capitol was not built at the point. During his presidency, he lived in New York and Philadelphia (History).\n\nMost people take this for granted, but at the time of Washington’s presidency, the U.S. had only 11 states and only four million people occupying it. Also, there was no concept of what the president should do in his position. Washington knew that his tenure would be an example for future presidents, so he did his best to govern in a fair and prudent manner. In terms of foreign policy, he tried to create positive relations with other countries, but remained neutral in international conflicts. In regard to domestic governance, he is noted for appointing the first chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, signing a bill to establish the first national bank, and setting up a presidential cabinet. He vied for diverging views within his cabinet, but was alarmed with the signs of partisanship, starting from Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton (History).\n\nAfter two terms as president, he resigned (there was no law at that time about the limit of terms). He retired to his family farm, leaving with a farewell address, stating that the U.S. should build upon its success domestically and not to be too concerned with foreign involvement. After successfully managing his farmlands for three years, he got a throat infection and Washington passed away on December 14, 1799 (History).\n\nNamed “Father of the Nation,” George Washington began life as a middle-class son of a plantation owner, became an accomplished farmer and surveyor, developed into an honored military and political genius, and was elected as the first U.S president with little opposition. His presidency is an example more modern presidents should follow, with his fairness, integrity, and prudence, especially in dealing with foreign powers, sans the holding of slaves.###"}

{"prompt":"What are some intriguing facts about Melania Trump?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Melania Trump is the current First Lady of the United States, but how much do we know about her? Besides being the first non-native First Lady since the presidency of Quincy Adams and the first First Lady ever to pose nude in a magazine, what other substantial things can we say about her? In the following paragraphs, let us delve into her life a bit more.\n\nShe was born on April 26th, 1970, in Novo Mesto, Slovenia, which was then part of communist Yugoslavia. Her father was a car dealer and her mother designed clothing for children. She did not grow up in extravagance, but a rather humble home, with a younger sister (Biography). Melania seems to have a knack for modeling, as she was already doing catwalks at the age of five, encouraged by her mother (Picard, C).\n\nAt the age of 16, she was professionally modeling in Milan with an agency, and Germanized her name to Melania Knauss (Picard, C). She was attending the University of Ljubljana for studying architecture, but dropped out after one year of attendance due to becoming a professional model. Though she modeled in Milan and Paris most of the time, she eventually moved to New York in 1996. It was in New York that she got steady work, and where she got her stardom. She began to appear in Vanity Fair, GQ, and Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, among other publications (Biography).\n\nAt a New York fashion party in 1998, she met her future husband, and now President of the United States, Donald Trump. Despite her rejecting his advances at first, Melania started to date the President eventually and announced their engagement in 2004. In 2005, she married Donald Trump, with many celebrities in attendance, including Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton (Biography). Within one year of their marriage, Melania gave birth to Barron William Trump, and in 2006, she became a full-fledged U.S. citizen (White House).\n\nBetween this time and her ascendance to being the First Lady, she launched her own jewelry line, and also a skincare line (Biography). Though busy with parenting and her business, she also appeared in an Aflac commercial, hosted The View, and was on the reality show Celebrity Apprentice.\n\nAfter a contentious and controversial bid for the presidency by her husband in 2016, she became the First Lady on November 8, 2017. As First Lady, in her first 100 days, she has acted as a hostess to the spouses of foreign leaders six times, hosted many social events, attended small meetings with social cause organizations, and went to impromptu meetings with children in hospitals and care centers. She is not a person who seeks out attention, and is not actively trying to be in the public eye as a First Lady (USA Today).\n\nTo add to more knowledge of the First Lady, the following is intriguing facts about her. She can speak in five languages, which includes Slovenian, English, French, Serbian, and German. Melania has also been appointed to “Honorary Chairwoman for Martha Graham Dance Company in April 2005, is an active member of the Police Athletic League which honored her with Woman of The Year 2006, has been an Honorary Chairwoman for The Boy’s Club of New York for five consecutive years, and in 2005 The American Red Cross awarded her with Goodwill Ambassador which she has proudly served for four years.  In April of 2008, she was asked by Love Our Children USA and NASDAQ to participate in the Fifth Annual National Love Our Children Day and the beginning of National Child Abuse Prevention month by ringing the closing bell at NASDAQ.  In 2010, Melania was the Chairwoman for The American Heart Association which raised $1.7 Million for research.  Melania’s philanthropic interests represent her humanitarian side, and she remains an indefatigable and dedicated New Yorker” (White House). Though citizens usually think she does not have leadership experience, the above information clearly shows that she does.\n\nMelania Trump is an anomaly as a First Lady. Besides being the significant other of one of the most controversial presidents in U.S. history, she is quite unusual herself. Being the second non-native born First Lady, the only First Lady to pose nude, and being a First Lady that does not vie for attention, has brought much focus on her, whether she likes it or not.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some scientifically-proven ways to become happy?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Happiness is often framed as an elusive condition. People may seek true happiness for their whole lives, and believe it is impossible to achieve. However, there are some scientifically-proven ways to become happy.\n\nExercise is one of the easiest ways to become happier. In fact, you may only need seven minutes a day to be happier (Inc). Not only is exercise a natural protection against depression, it aids you in your intellectual powers, in relaxing, and in improving your body image.\n\nAnother natural deterrent of unhappiness is sleep. Sleep makes you less susceptible to negative emotions and thoughts (Inc). Your mood will also be much improved with eight hours of sleep each night.\n\nIf you are feeling sad, it is common to want to spend more time with friends and family. Though it sounds everyday, it is scientifically proven that having close relationships with friends and family will convert into more happiness (Sparring Minds). In fact, it is recommended to have at least five people whom you feel close to in order to feel sufficiently happy.\n\nStaying home too often can be a downer for your mood, as you might have noticed. Getting out more, doing activities with others, and seeing nature in its splendor will aid you in becoming happy. Spending 20 minutes outside in nature not only boosts one’s mood, but also one’s working memory and thinking capabilities (Inc).\n\nSurprisingly, helping others increases our happiness as well. In fact, 100 hours of giving help per year (or two hours a week) can be the magic number to feeling better (Inc). In many studies, helping others has been found to boost happiness for reasons such as feeling more accomplished and feeling more self worth.\n\nThis might sound weird, but smiling, can help improve our mood. However, fake smiles, if not accompanied by positive thoughts, can make you more unhappy (Inc). Facial feedback is important, as when you genuinely smile, you are telling your brain you are not in distress.\n\nPlanning a trip away from your current vicinity can help in becoming more happy, even if you do not go on the trip (Inc). That sense of hope bleeds positive emotions into your consciousness. In fact, planning a trip can boost your happiness for eight solid weeks.\n\nMeditation is one of the best ways to feel better. If the meditation focuses on the state of awareness without thought, you will get many benefits, including reduced stress, better focus, less restlessness, and more joy in one’s life (Researching Meditation). It is a highly recommended daily practice, with only five to ten minutes needed in the morning and at night for a happy day and happy sleep.\n\nThere are many ways to become happy, or at least to become happier. However, these are the main ways, and the cheapest. It may be startling that the quickest ways to feel happier are also the most natural. This is because money, drugs, alcohol, and other external items cannot reproduce what happens within us in the most innate of ways.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the three main speculations about what came before the Big Bang?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Physicists usually point to the Big Bang or Big Expansion as the beginning of the universe, and from cosmic microwave background radiation, physicists predict that the universe is approximately 14 billion years old (Discover Magazine). What is the mysterious thing about the Big Bang is what came before it, and how it set off to create the universe as we know it. There are no solid theories of what happened before the Big Bang, however there are many speculations. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss the three main speculations about this elusive subject.\n\nOne concept is that the universe came out of another universe before it, sometimes called the Big Bounce. Essentially, the idea is that a previous universe collapsed inwardly into a point of infinite gravity, which is called a singularity. From this point, it bounced back, creating our universe (Gizmodo). Bouncing back refers to the cycle of expansion and contraction of the universe. This would make the universe as we know it timeless.\n\nAnother speculation is that the universe was hibernating before the Big Bang. Physicists like Kurt Hinterbichler, Austin Joyce, and Justin Khoury believe that the universe could have resided in a small fixed space, and was slowly evolving. The universe could have been in a metastate, meaning that its condition would be stable until it could find a state more stable than its original one (Gizmodo).\n\nProbably the most popular speculation among physicists now is that there is a multiverse. To use a metaphor, there is a cosmic soup where universes bubble out from. The bubbling out can be seen as inflation, which explains how our particular universe came into being. At the time of the Big Bang, a bubbling out happened at an unimaginable speed. During this expansion, quantum mechanics predicts that fluctuations were happening within space at that time, and that the energy from these fluctuations could have created galaxies and voids (Gizmodo). This concept avoids issues with decreasing entropy that is present in other ideas, and could explain the low-entropy universe we have now (entropy is a term of physics that describes a “thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system’s thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system” (Google Dictionary)).\n\nThough physicists have evidence that before the Big Bang, the universe was highly compressed in a state where our laws of physics do not perform (Discover Magazine), they do not have appropriate evidence yet to form a proper theory of how our universe came into being. However, there are three speculations that seem viable to explain how our universe was formed: the Big Bounce concept, a hibernation of our universe, and the multiverse concept. All three ideas, and more, are plausible. Only time will tell if any of these speculations will match up with mounting evidence.###"}
{"prompt":"How has the American flag changed over time?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The American flag has gone through quite an evolution, and might undergo even more change with the addition of Puerto Rico as an official state soon. Even though we think we have seen the same flag for countless years, it was quite different just a few decades ago. For instance, between 1777 and 1960, Congress passed many acts to change the design of the flag to account for the admission of states (PBS). Let us delve into its history a bit more in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe official American flag came into being on June 14th, 1777, when the Continental Congress passed an act to establish an official flag for the American people (PBS). The act stated: “Resolved, that the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.” However, the first unofficial American flag was shown in 1775, when American ships in New England had a “Liberty Tree” flag. The flag consisted of a green pine tree with a white background, with the words, “An Appeal to Heaven” inscribed on it (US History).\n\nThroughout the history of the U.S., there has been over 30 variations of the American flag (US History). However, the origin of the official American flag is unknown. A few historians believe it was designed by New Jersey Congressman Francis Hopkinson and sewn by Philadelphia seamstress Betsy Ross (PBS). But with so many variations, it is difficult to exactly trace the official flag’s origins.\n\nIn terms of symbolism, the official American flag, with 13 horizontal stripes—seven red alternating with six white—represents the 13 original colonies. The stars symbolize the 50 states that comprise the U.S. The colors of the American flag also contain symbolism. Red is employed to demonstrate valor and persistence, while the white stands for purity and innocence—finally, the blue represents vigilance, perseverance, and justice (PBS).\n\nThe American flag, with its mysterious history and strange variations, is a fascinating historical item.

{"prompt":"What are the dangers of loneliness and how can it be treated?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Everyone probably knows the feeling of isolation, when the entire world seems to be behind a glass wall: one can see people on the other side, interact and talk to them, live a more or less normal life—but feel alone and forgotten somewhere deep inside. In a world where communication is the new god, where extroverted behaviors are deemed healthy and normal, and where everything calls a person to belong to a certain group, being and feeling alone often seems wrong. There is nothing bad in needing solitude; from time to time, all of us need to spend some time on our own. However, solitude is rather a voluntary choice; when this condition becomes chronic and undesired, when a person feels the impossibility of establishing contact with others, this is already something many people around the world fear strongly: this is loneliness.\n\nWhat exactly is loneliness? A more narrow definition suggests that loneliness is the condition when a person is not surrounded by other people, spends most of his or her time alone, and maintains little-to-no social contact. However, anyone who had at least once experienced the condition of loneliness knows that it is possible to be surrounded by friends or family, stay in the thick of things, and still feel isolated. In fact, the statistics shows about 60% of people who feel lonely are married, which is a good illustration of the thesis that loneliness does not depend on the environment, that the amount and variety of social connections and\\or relationships do not necessarily save us from it. (Psychology Today).\n\nA better understanding of loneliness can be achieved from the analysis of the needs and desires standing behind it—or, to be precise, the impossibility to satisfy these needs. According to Baumeister and Leary, every person has a basic need to belong to a certain group; this need is as significant and natural as the need to eat, to sleep, or to feel safe. However, simply belonging on its own does not satisfy the need: it is important that a person can form strong, close, and stable interpersonal relationships, and maintain them: only in this case the sense of belonging will be full. This makes sense even from the evolutionary point of view: staying together with other people was a guarantee of physical survival in ancient times. Continuing the parallel between emotional and physical (or basic) needs, our bodies are often wiser than our minds: when there is a lack or a surplus of something, our bodies react appropriately. Sensations (such as hunger, heat, and so on) and emotions are the signals our bodies send to our minds in order to alert them about these shortages and surpluses. Respectively, loneliness is an emotion which signals that the need of belonging is not satisfied, or that we are not getting the relationships (or the quality of already existing relationships) that we want (Web of Loneliness). This often seems irrational: for example, a person can have a lot of friends and see them often, he or she can be married and have children, have no problems with colleagues at work—everything is seemingly fine, but the sense of loneliness is still there, and it is important to understand why it is present, what is lacking.\n\nBeing in strong and close relationships affects our mental health beneficially; being alone for a long period of time can lead to a number of negative consequences, both on mental and physiological levels. In particular, loneliness can lead to depression (which is a dangerous mental condition on its own), a feeling of hopelessness, low self-esteem, an impaired ability for social interactions and work, suicidal tendencies, poor sleep, the sense of defeat, and helplessness. These sensations form a vicious circle—nurturing each other, they aggravate the situation of a lonely person, preventing him or her from getting out of this span on his or her own. Not only the emotional sphere, but also bodily functions are affected by loneliness. Studies show that lonely people face cardiovascular diseases more frequently than those enjoying strong and stable relationships with other people; other effects include the loss of weight, hormonal imbalances, the inhibition of the immune system, low resistance to infections and inflammations, dementia (in old age), and the degradation of bones and muscle tissue (The Doctor’s Tablet). All this does not mean that a person starts experiencing all these negative effects every time he or she feels lonely; however, these effects accumulate during prolonged isolation, “chronic” loneliness; therefore, it is important to not try to deal with this condition on one’s own, and seek professional help.\n\nIn fact, there are many effective ways to treat loneliness. Many people think that it is enough to increase the amount of social contacts, go out more often, and loneliness will be dealt with. However, loneliness is more about a person’s ability to form close relationships and bond with others, rather than about how often one is exposed to other people. Similar to other negative mental conditions, the first important step is to let yourself feel loneliness, and admit that you would like to live differently than you do. People often try to overpower their loneliness; they either tend to not treat it as something significant, considering it to be a weakness, or even deny that they are feeling lonely. When the problem is accepted and defined, it is recommended to start attending local psychotherapy sessions; cognitive-behavioral therapy usually provides solid results in treating loneliness, although other psychology schools, such as gestalt therapy can also be efficient, try finding what suits you the best. If you cannot afford attending a psychotherapist, consider utilizing a variety of relaxation and stress-relief techniques such as meditation, muscle relaxation training, guided mental imagery, or comforting self-talk. Pet therapy can be helpful as well; in fact, many people intuitively feel the need to have a living being nearby, whom they would be able to take care of, so owning a dog, cat, bird, or even a lizard can be a nice way to cope with loneliness (Psychologist Anywhere, Anytime). In many western countries, especially in the United States, it is extremely popular to prescribe medicine in order to deal with mental conditions; however, it is important to remember that loneliness is rather an emotional condition, not a biochemical one, so if you decide to take pills, it might help you inhibit unpleasant and painful feelings, but it will not solve your problem. Pills might be helpful if you are already suffering from depression as a result of loneliness—and even in this case, you should consider going to psychotherapy sessions.\n\nLoneliness is not the same as solitude. The latter is a voluntary act of isolation from a society in order to refresh oneself, sort out one’s thoughts, and take a break from intense social interactions. Loneliness, in its turn, is a chronic and undesired condition when a person is unable (due to a number of reasons) to establish and maintain contact and close, stable relationships with surrounding people. Prolonged loneliness can be dangerous, since it can cause a variety of emotional and physiological problems. However, the good news is that loneliness can be treated effectively, mostly with the help of a professional psychotherapist.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the creepiest burial rituals from around the world?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One of the criteria of a civilized society is how its members treat their dead. Technological advancements such as the invention of the wheel, pottery and masonry, engineering, gunpowder, and so on, are important, but it is culture and spiritual conceptions that distinguish civilization from barbarism. Why? Mostly because death—as a phenomenon that scared and mystified humanity throughout its entire history—is something unknown, uncharted territory, and in order to make this territory less hostile and mysterious, ancient people inhabited it with spirits, gods, and demons, and imbued it with certain rules; in other words, ancients paved the road that starts beyond the borders of death with the bricks of their ideas about how things are on the other side of life. Where there are gods and rules, there are commandments and rituals; ancient people believed that individuals who left the world of the living should be prepared for the afterlife properly and thoroughly—otherwise there could be terrible consequences. With these concepts, a number of burial traditions gradually developed.\n\nEvery nation has their own burial rituals, and each of them has a significant background—reasons why people bury their dead one way or another. Christians put them into the soil; Buddhists burn them; Hindus let the dead bodies float in the sacred waters of the Ganges river. Educated people of the West have become accustomed to these rituals; cremations or burials do not scare people in general, so these rituals are seen as normal and acceptable. However, there are other ways to treat the dead—and many of them may seem shocking or even disgusting to a westerner. When facing such rituals, it is important to remember that every nation and culture has its own reasons to bury the dead in a certain way, so instead of claiming a tradition to be barbaric or inhumane, it is better to tolerate it as something natural for this particular culture; or, even better would be to learn the reasons causing the representatives of a culture to treat their dead in the ways they do, and try to not judge them based on more “acceptable” ideas of burial. This would be true tolerance and open-mindedness.\n\nNow, after such a long but necessary introduction, let us take a look at some of the creepiest (for a western person) burial rituals different nations from around the world.\n\nOne of them is the Buddhist sky burial. If you are unfamiliar with this tradition, you might picture something romantic, almost celestial—for example, the burial is on the top of a mountain, or immersing a dead body into the water of a placid lake in which the night sky reflects its stars. However, in terms of aesthetics, the sky burial is the opposite. It is called this because dead bodies are given to predatory birds, who peck all the flesh from the carcass incredibly fast. This ritual is mostly practiced in Tibet and the kingdom of Mustang, and comes from the idea that a human being must be useful to the world at every stage of his or her existence—even in death. Buddhists treat physical bodies as mere vessels for the soul; after a person dies, his or her soul “flies away,” and awaits reincarnation; as for the body, its most obvious use for the world is to become food for other living beings—birds, in the case of the sky burial. Besides, there is little to no timber in the region, so the regular Buddhist cremation is unavailable for poor people living in Tibet and Mustang. Now starts the creepiest part of the ritual. When a person dies, they must be prepared for the burial; since birds cannot eat the chunks of flesh that are too big, a special worker must dismember the body, cutting it into tiny pieces using a sharp knife. The bodies are usually dissected nearby a river: a monk reads prayers for the deceased, while the dissector cuts off limbs, scalps the body, and does all other work necessary to grind the body in the way most comfortable for the birds. After the work is done, a flock of predatory birds finishes the body off in no time, leaving just plain white bones. However, this is not all; the bones are usually ground down to dust with a maul. Then, this dust is mixed with grain, and fed to smaller birds. This way, there is nothing left from a body after the sky burial is finished. This tradition is extremely old—according to the Tibetan Book of the Dead, people of the region started practicing it since the 12th century, or perhaps even earlier (Cracked). Even though the tradition looks extremely morbid, for Tibetans, it is rather mundane, and the procedure with the body is made with all due respect—it is a ritual, and rituals are sacred.\n\nThe next burial ritual comes from India—the country which, as we know, is the birthplace of everything exotic, alien, mysterious, spiritual, and at the same time shocking. The ritual is called Sati, and to put a long story short, it is a tradition of self-immolation. Why would anyone even want to burn themselves, might you ask? Sati is a ritual practiced mostly by grieving widows; the Hindu religion prescribes to burn bodies after death (or at least put them in Ganges), and in some cases, a wife of a deceased man, instead of having to live in grief, prefers to lie with her dead husband on the burial pyre. Sati is not something a widow is obliged to do, but the ritual is so popular and widespread that it had to be banned multiple times (io9). It was first banned by the British occupational forces in 1829, then in 1956, and later in 1981. However, there are reasons to believe that Sati is still being practiced somewhere in the distant corners of India. Even though the ritual is mostly voluntary, there are cases when women were thrown into pyres against their will; also, since burning alive is agonizing, not all widows can stand the pain and try to jump off the pyre. This, however, is considered to be highly dishonorable, so it is the duty of the witnesses of the ritual to push a woman back into the fire if she tries to escape (Cracked).\n\nProbably less peculiar, but still creepy, is the tradition that is still occasionally practiced by the tribes in the jungles of Brazil and Papua New Guinea: endocannibalism. Among primitive tribes, cannibalism was a way to consume the strength of an enemy killed during war; endocannibalism, in its turn, is consuming the flesh of a person belonging to the same group, not to the group of enemies. When a member of a tribe dies, his or her body is not buried or burned, but eaten by the family members of the deceased. In order to make the body eatable, tribes use fire and other regular methods of cooking food; although this does not make the ritual less horrible. It is believed that the ritual emerged as a way for malnourished tribes to sustain themselves during the most difficult times of hunger, and although there are few cases of endocannibalism nowadays, one cannot be sure that it has gone into oblivion (Wonderslist.com).\n\nThese are just some of the bizarre death rituals practiced around the world; considering how many cultures exist on our planet, it is likely that the amount of such morbid rituals exceeds all possible estimates. It is important to remember that these rituals do not come from cruelty or inhumanity; each nation has reasons to bury its dead one way or another. For such nations, our “regular” traditions might seem terrifying as well; for example, a Tibetan villager could be shocked with the idea to put a dead body six feet under damp ground in a narrow box, and to be left decaying and eaten by maggots for years after death. Death is a delicate matter, and the rituals surrounding death are a matter of perspective: acceptable and normal for one culture, a certain ritual may seem wild and barbaric to another culture. Therefore, it is better to treat such rituals with respect—or at least tolerate them, recognizing each nation’s right to bury dead in its own way.###"}
{"prompt":"How do video games that contain sexualized female characters promote sexist attitudes?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is difficult to disagree that video games have nowadays become one of the largest entertainment industries. Annually, a large number of video games are released—starting from independent projects or self-made games with basic graphics, and ending up with expensive AAA titles, operating budgets equal or bigger to those in Hollywood, with astonishing graphics and visual effects. One of the best examples is Grand Theft Auto V—the product that has brought video gaming standards to a whole new level, introducing a vast interactive copy of Los Angeles with tons of activities, missions, a deep story, and graphics which looks great even several years after its release.\n\nUnfortunately, along with rapid development and stunning innovations, the video gaming industry also brings up a number of issues not every society knows how to properly deal with. The widely-discussed controversy of violence in video games, for example, causes governments to sometimes ban certain video games; this is strange, to put it mildly, because movies and other forms of art addressing delicate issues remain easily accessible to everyone, including children. Another controversy about video games is the gender stereotypes and sexism they often promote. Indeed, if one takes a look at almost any major game present on the market nowadays, he or she will notice how much exploitation, sexualization, and stereotypization some of these games contain. Female characters are often portrayed in perfect physical shape, sexually appealing, and unrealistically good-looking. Male characters, in their turn, are aggressive, overly self-confident or showing off, and prone to violence when solving difficult situations.\n\nThe examples are many. A popular fighting game “Dead or Alive: Last Round” heavily exploits the subject of feminine sexuality, portraying all the female fighters half-dressed, and allowing players to dress them in more-than-explicit outfits. “Bayonetta,” a console third-person action game, named after the main heroine, sexualizes the main protagonist in an over-the-top manner. “Fallout 2,” a role-playing game, which is considered to be one of the best video games in history (and also one of the most politically incorrect ones), allows female characters to achieve certain goals through sex. “Soul Calibur,” Mortal Kombat” IX and X, “Bloodrayne,” or almost any of the modern MMORPG games do the same: stressing on feminine sexuality and partial nudity, they set unrealistic images of beauty and of behavioral standards, mostly because the majority of their target audiences are young men.\n\nBesides, women in video games are often displayed as passive personalities. The image of a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued is used in a number of old and modern video games. In the best case scenario, such an approach turns female characters into “plot triggers,” when the main protagonist must go through hardships to save the maiden; there are games in which female characters act not only as passive objects, but also behave in sexually suggestive ways. Thus, they transmit additionally-reinforced sexist messages, which can be interpreted as “a woman passively waiting for a player to perform actions, motivating him or her with potential sex as reward” (IFR).\n\nAt first glance, it might seem not like a big deal. However, there are certain problems connected to such an approach in character development. One of them is that even if a game does not intend to promote sexist attitudes (the aforementioned Mortal Kombat series, for instance, as it emphasizes fighting rather than sexuality), it still does it. According to Douglas Gentile, a professor of psychology at Iowa State University, such attitudes can be inspired subconsciously, through a gamer’s prolonged and repetitive exposure to certain content. This thesis is supported by an extensive study conducted by Gentile and his colleagues, and involving more than 13,000 teenagers. Gentile says that, “Many different aspects of life can influence sexist attitudes. It was surprising to find a small but significant link between game play and sexism. Video games are not intended to teach sexist views, but most people don’t realize how attitudes can shift with practice,” Gentile said. “Nonetheless, much of our learning is not conscious and we pick up on subtle cues without realizing it” (ScienceDaily).\n\nBandura’s Social Cognitive Theory suggests that learning different ways of interacting with the world around us is possible through the representations of this world in models, and our exposure to them. People tend to use knowledge they acquired (for example, perceiving other people or building relationships with them) through interacting with these models in the real world. Contemporary media psychology suggests that being regularly exposed to digital representations of the female body and behaviors can affect the ways in which gamers perceive and interact with women in real life—not only forming attitudes, but also changing already formed ones. Teenagers playing video games may build up expectations about women, or develop cognitive and behavioral patterns regarding women, based on distorted realities depicted in these games. Supposedly, the more time a teenager spends playing video games that depict women in sexist or even misogynistic ways, the higher chances sexist attitudes may develop. Since video games are interactive (and thus often let gamers not only develop attitudes, but also apply them “in practice,” despite it being in the virtual world), they may effectively help gamers learn and anchor wrong ideas about gender roles (Frontiers).\n\nAlthough many modern games try to break gender stereotypes and depict women in more respective ways, the fact that the majority of gamers are men still influences game development, so female characters continue being displayed in ways appealing to men. Scantily clad, overly-sexualized or sexually suggesting, passive and waiting-to-be-taken-actions-upon female characters in video games still promote sexist attitudes. Regarding the fact that video games can be seen as highly effective interactive learning tools, this fact needs to be heavily considered and fixed by game developers.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of climbing Mount Everest?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Alpinism has always been the occupation of the bravest. It is difficult to find more difficult conditions on Earth; of course, there are deserts, arctic wastelands, and jungles, but still, extreme heights can only fairly be compared to ocean depths. Why? Even the not-so-high mountains are difficult to climb: rocks, abysses, and extreme weather conditions are just some of the dangers alpinists overcome in order to climb yet another summit. In case of mountains higher than 6000 meters, the human body undergoes severe stress, such as the lack of oxygen, sub-zero temperatures up to -50 C or even lower, and lung and brain edema. Moreover, at such heights, the human body completely loses its regenerative abilities, so the survival of alpinists depends on their inner resources, thorough preparations, and sheer luck. All this, along with other dangers, awaits brave (or reckless) people who aim at climbing the summit of the highest mountain in the world: Everest.\n\nSince it was first climbed by Edmund Hillary and sherpa Tenzing Norgey (sherpa are the people inhabiting Nepal’s highlands, and often work as guides and hired workers for alpinists and tourists arriving to this country) in 1953, Everest, or Chomolungma as the Nepalese people call it (the name means “The mountain that no bird can fly over”), has become the dream destination of all alpinists worldwide. There were numerous attempts to climb the summit before Hillary and Tenzing, but only after these two heroes climbed it did Everest become open to other alpinists. Although, it is probably incorrect to say “open:” climbing the mountain is not a Sunday walk in a park, and hundreds of people (more than 220, in fact) died on its hills, desperately trying to reach the roof of the Earth—even nowadays, with all the modern equipment and security measures. The bodies of those who died there remain lying in the snow for decades—because of the extreme conditions, no one attempts to bury or take them off the mountain. The bodies of the fallen now serve as height marks for those who are still alive. Sometimes, whole groups of alpinists die on Everest, as it happened in 1996 with the commercial expedition led by experienced instructors. The tragedy of Rob Hall’s and Scott Fischer’s groups of alpinists became one of the biggest disasters in the history of 20th century alpinism, and inspired numerous documentaries, movies, books, and investigations.\n\nIn 1996, Rob Hall (“Adventure Consultants”) and Scott Fischer (“Mountain Madness”) organized an alpinistic tour for rich people wishing to climb the summit of Everest. They hired sherpas, delivered all the necessary equipment to the base camp, from which all the expeditions started, and promised to take the tourists to the top and back. The “Adventure Consultants” group included Rob Hall (leader and instructor), Mike Groom (guide), Andy Harris (guide), Frank Fischbeck, Doug Hansen, Stuart Hutchison, Lou Kasischke, Jon Krakauer (a journalist, whose diary about the expedition later became a bestseller in the U.S.), Yasuko Namba, John Taske, and Beck Weathers (an extremely lucky alpinist who stood on the brink of death three times and survived). Besides tourists, “Adventure Consultants” used the services of sherpas: Sardar Ang Dorje, Arita, Chuldum, Kami, Lhakpa Chhiri, Ngawang Norbu, Tenzing, Lopsang. “Mountain Madness” included Scott Fischer (leader and instructor), Neal Beidleman (guide), Anatoli Bukreev (guide), Martin Adams, Charlotte Fox, Lene Gammelgaard, Dale Kruse, Tim Madsen, Sandy Hill Pittman, Pitt Schoening, and Klev Schoening. The sherpas whose services “Mountain Madness” used were Sardar Lopsang Jangbu Sherpa, Pemba, Ngawang Dorje, Ngawang Sya Kya, Ngawang Tendi, Ngawang Topche, Tashi Tshering, and Tendi (Wikipedia). All of the members of both teams were experienced alpinists, who had climbed numerous summits before. Still, for many of them, Everest was the most extreme and the highest mountain in their careers, so—as some researchers argue—they might have lacked appropriate experience and skills needed to ascend Chomolungma.\n\nThe two expeditions started the acclimatization process in the middle of April; acclimatization is needed to adjust the human body to the hellish conditions of higher altitudes, and usually includes increasingly longer expeditions to higher altitudes, with subsequent returns to base camp. This way, the body can gradually increase resistance to HAPE and HACE symptoms, frost, low pressure, and other risks. The whole way since the beginning of the expedition and up to the tragic days took about four weeks: the teams passed the Khumbu Icefall, arriving at Camp 1 (around 6000 meters), then made their way to Camp 2 approximately 700 meters higher (and at higher altitudes, it is more intense to go the distance; sometimes alpinists climbing the altitudes above 8000 meters may need hours to pass 200-300 meters). The expedition successfully passed Camp 3 at the altitude of 8000 meters, and on May 9th, scheduled the ascent to Camp 4, at the enormous height of around 8600 meters. Beyond 8000 meters above sea level, the “death zone” begins—the area in which oxygen levels are three times lower than normal, and weather conditions are harsher than any other place on Earth (ThoughtCo). In addition, other dangers alpinists face at such altitudes are HAPE (high-altitude pulmonary edema, or lung edema) and HACE (high-altitude cerebral edema, or brain edema)—not to mention slippery slopes ending with deadly abysses several kilometers deep.\n\nIt is also important to mention that besides the groups “Adventure Consultants” and “Mountain Madness,” there were two other expeditions trying to reach the summit at that time, and this became, as it is believed, one of the reasons that led to further tragedy. The path to the top of Everest is not broad, so if there are too many people trying to climb the mountain at once, there may be “bottlenecks” in the narrow zones. In its turn, the reason why there were four expeditions rushing to the summit on the same day is that the weather on Everest is extremely unstable, and usually there are only a few days in spring (mostly in May) when climate conditions are more or less normal, allowing climbing attempts.\n\nOn the 10th of May, all four teams attempted to ascend to the summit. Anatoli Bukreev, one of the guides, managed to take his team to the top earlier than Rob Hall and Scott Fischer, and descended earlier, alone. The latter two, however—as well as their teams—did not manage to keep up with the schedule, and spent too much time reaching the top (which can be explained by severe fatigue and the aforementioned “bottlenecks” earlier on the way). The Himalayan Mountains, and Everest in particular, are infamous for their sudden weather changes; no one noticed or paid enough attention to the slight signs of the upcoming disaster. A horrible blizzard struck out of the blue, leaving expedition members, exhausted with the ascendance, disorganized and disoriented. Even such experienced climbers as Hall and Fischer, who already climbed Everest before, could not make it back to the camp. Bukreev, who descended earlier that day, single-handedly attempted to rescue those of the alpinists who got lost in the blizzard, and managed to save three of them. Jon Krakauer, a journalist and one of the expedition members, heavily criticized Bukreev later—not for his actions during the storm, but rather for his guiding decisions prior to the disaster, assuming that the lack of oxygen might have had affected Bukreev’s ability to make better choices. Bukreev countered Krakauer’s accusations in the book “The Climb,” published in 1997. One way or another, eight members of the expedition, including both Hall and Fischer, died that day. Hall managed to contact his wife in New Zealand via satellite phone, moments before he froze to death (History.com). This episode, as well as the whole story of the tragic climb, are well-depicted in numerous documentaries and movies that followed the tragedy.\n\nEverest is the highest mountain on our planet, and one of the mountains garnering annual death tolls for more than half a century. Sherpas believe there are gods inhabiting the summit of Chomolungma; for many alpinists who died there, it turned out to be a realm of demons. In the case of the groups “Adventure Consultants” and “Mountain Madness,” the reasons were the lack of organization, an unexpected blizzard, and a dire set of unfortunate circumstances. But, whatever the reasons, 1996 became one of the most tragic years in the history of Chomolungma climbings.###"}
{"prompt":"What was Voltaire's opinion of the Buddha?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This article [Voltaire and the Buddha] was originally published in The Public Domain Review [https:\/\/publicdomainreview.org\/2017\/03\/08\/voltaire-and-the-buddha\/] under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0. If you wish to reuse it please see: http:\/\/publicdomainreview.org\/legal\/\n\nBy Donald S. Lopez, Jr.\n\nAfter Ignatius Loyola formed the Society of Jesus in 1539, he required that his missionaries send back detailed letters describing their activities and the peoples and places they encountered. In France, over the course of the eighteenth century, these were gathered together and published as Lettres édifiantes et curieuses, thirty-four volumes of which appeared between 1702 and 1776. The Jesuit accounts of far-flung lands were widely read during the Enlightenment, serving, for example, as important sources for Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d’Alembert’s seminal Encyclopédie. The contents of the letters were various, but the Jesuits’ mission being what it was, it is perhaps not surprising that religion figured prominently, with many accounts of what would one day be called Buddhism.\n\nWell into the nineteenth century, Europeans divided the population of the world into four nations, based on their religion: Christians, Jews, Muslims (often called Mahometans), and Idolaters. For centuries, Buddhists fell into this last category. The process of their elevation to having an “ism” of their own is too long to tell here. However, one chapter in that story would be about those Jesuits, the intrepid travelers who set out from Europe to spread the Gospel across Asia. St Francis Xavier arrived in Japan in 1549, first imagining a kinship with Buddhists; later he would condemn them. In China, Matteo Ricci first dressed as a Buddhist monk before adopting the guise of a Confucian scholar, writing works in Chinese condemning the “religion of Fo” (fo is the Chinese word for Buddha). Early reports on the Buddhism of Thailand came from delegations sent to the court of Siam by Louis XIV, delegations that included Jesuit priests.\n\nThe term “Buddhism” would not appear in English until the early nineteenth century. The Jesuits who wrote the reports and the scholars who read them did not recognize that the religions they encountered in China, Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand were somehow the same. Each had its own indigenous term for “Buddha” and each had its own artistic conventions for representing him. His portrayal as an idol and as a purveyor of idolatry did not change substantially over the course of the eighteenth century, but much more information about him and his teachings began to accumulate.\n\nThe Encyclopédie of Diderot and d’Alembert was certainly the most famous of the compendia of knowledge of the Enlightenment, but it was not the only one. Inspired by it, in 1764, Voltaire published his own, which he called Dictionnaire philosophique. Like so many of his works, it was hailed by some and condemned by others. In it, he criticized the Roman Catholic Church and offered negative portrayals of Judaism and Islam. He also criticized Buddhism (although he did not use the term), but he praised the Buddha, seeking, as others would do in the centuries that followed, to separate the teacher from what would be represented as his teachings. Indeed, he devoted an entry in his dictionary to the Buddha, referring to him by the French rendering of one of his Thai epithets, Sammonocodom, that is, the śramaṇa (mendicant) Gautama.\n\nHe begins, “I recall that Sammonocodom, the god of the Siamese, was born from a young virgin and was raised on a flower.” He goes on to list, not without irony, other famous cases of miraculous birth from other cultures. Immediately seeking to separate the man from the myth, he observes that, “The religion of the Siamese proves to us that never did a lawmaker teach bad morals,” noting that the rules that the Buddha made for his monks are just as severe as those of St. Benedict. Voltaire goes on to provide a somewhat idiosyncratic but not inaccurate list of these rules. It includes, “Avoid songs, dances, assemblies, everything that might soften the soul,” “Do not have gold or silver,” “Speak only of justice and work only for justice,” “Sleep little, eat little, keep only one robe,” Never mock,” and “Meditate in private, and reflect often on the fragility of human affairs.”\n\nThis leads him to lament that in all religions “such a holy and necessary morality” has been sullied by all manner of ridiculous and risible stories. “Why is there not a single religion whose precepts do not come from a sage and whose dogmas are not of a madman?” He lays the blame for this at the feet of the disciples, who fear that their founder will not be respected if he is not somehow divine. The consequences of this deception, however, are dire. Reasonable people are attracted to the precepts of the founder, but are repelled by the doctrines invented by the disciples. As a result, they inevitably come to reject the original precepts. “So they shake the yoke, since it had been put on badly; they no longer believe in God, because they see well that Sammonocodom is not god.”\n\nIn the latter half of the entry on the Buddha, Voltaire demonstrates that he has read the reports of the French Jesuits closely. He enters into a discussion of a relatively arcane story in the life of the Buddha, reported by several members of the French delegation to Thailand, including the Jesuit Guy Tachard (1651-1712).\n\nIn traditional accounts of the life of the Buddha, he has an evil cousin named Devadatta. When the Buddha grows old, Devadatta, himself a monk, urges the Buddha to retire and turn leadership of the order of monks over to him. When the Buddha refuses, Devadatta tries to assassinate him on three different occasions. The weight of these sins is so great that he is swallowed by the earth, descending to the most horrific of the several Buddhist hells, where he is impaled on three iron spikes, one from his head to his feet, one through his chest, and one through his shoulders. When Buddhist monks at the Siamese court saw the crucifixes around the necks of the French Jesuits, they assumed that it was Devadatta, that the foreign priests worshipped the Buddha’s nemesis. Several members of the French delegation reported that this dashed any hopes of conversion. When they tried to explain that this was not Devadatta but God, the Buddhist monks doubted that someone as powerful as God could succumb to such a punishment.\n\nVoltaire reports all of this, describing Devadatta (whom he calls Thevatat) as “a badly behaved rascal,” although he mistakes the sequence of events, imagining the Devadatta was crucified on earth and then went to hell. What is noteworthy, however, is that rather than seeing the great irony in the Jesuits’ despair, as this famous apparent atheist might be expected to do, he comes to their defense, noting that Jesus, the true God, had given Pontius Pilate the power to crucify him. Thus, if God can be crucified, his brother certainly can; Voltaire notes that St. Jacques, the brother of Jesus, was stoned. In the case of Devadatta, he could have been hanged rather than crucified, and his punishment may have been unjust. If he was executed for a crime he did not commit, he might have gone to heaven rather than hell. Voltaire concludes, “All of this is extremely delicate.”\n\nVoltaire’s assent here to the theology of the crucifixion would seem at odds with his often rude remarks about Christianity. However, what is perhaps of greater interest is Voltaire’s prescience in his comments about the Buddha. It would not be until well into the nineteenth century that European scholars, all sons of the Enlightenment, sought to turn the founders of religions from gods into men, to separate their precepts from church doctrine. For Jesus and the Buddha, this transformation entailed not debasement but exaltation. One thinks immediately of David Strauss’ Das Leben Jesu (1835), Eugène Burnouf’s Introduction à l’histoire du Buddhisme indien (1844), and Hermann Oldenberg’s Buddha: Sein Leben, seine Lehre, seine Gemeinde (1881). Over the course of the nineteenth century, the European portrayal of Buddhism underwent a profound metamorphosis: from a form of idolatry practiced by pagans, to a religion, and a world religion, finally to something beyond the category of religion. Today, scholars of Buddhism are often asked: Is Buddhism a religion, a philosophy, or a way of life? Such a question is impossible without the work of disciples of a different Enlightenment, who believed that the founder could somehow be separated from the faith.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDonald S.

{"prompt":"How do you think parents should handle their children dating?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Some parents are liberal when it comes to their children dating, while other parents are conservative when allowing their “babies” into the dating world. For preteens and teens, hormones are flying high, and that means that these individuals begin to look for dates at this age. What might shock some people is that girls on average start to date around 12 and half years old, and boys begin dating around 13 and a half years old. This fact will strike fear into many parents’ hearts, as when the parents were their children’s ages, they started dating much later on average (Healthline). What are some of the things that parents can do when their children express a desire to date? You can talk about dating guidelines with them, not allow non-solo dating before the age of 16, or help them cope with their feelings while telling them no.\n\nAs a parent, it is your duty to set limits for your child. If you remove limits for your children, they will understand that they can get away with anything. When it comes to your children dating, you should be especially keen on limits. Let them know about curfews, restrictions on drugs and alcohol, a restriction on sexual intercourse, and other restrictions based on your personal beliefs and what you think is best for your child. Each parent knows their children best, so one needs to know which restrictions should be kept in place (Psychology Today).\n\nAnother restriction that is essential to the process of easing children into dating is allowing only non-solo dating, which means parents would accompany their children on dates. A good rule is to accompany your child on dates if he or she is younger than 16 years old (healthychildren.org). This is because before the age of 16, children are a lot less mature. Also, an unwanted pregnancy at 14 is much worse than an unwanted pregnancy at 16. Your children will likely dislike the idea of you tagging along on their dates, but let them know that you are doing the best you can do for them.\n\nIf you are more on the conservative end, and do not want to allow your children to date for a while, allow them to express their feelings openly with you. In turn, you should express your feelings with them, and tell why exactly you are making this choice for them. You can help them cope with their feelings by encouraging them to draw, paint, write poetry, write songs, or anything else creative to let out their emotions. Try to make it so that you are not the “bad parent” but a supporter of their well-being.\n\nAs parents, when children grow up to be of dating age, they have a hard choice to make. Yet, one has many options: to set limits for their children while dating, to accompany children while on dates, or to restrict children from dating, but in a way that shows understanding and support. Parents have the responsibility to choose which option they will adopt, but should have their children’s future at heart.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the 10 main causes of divorce?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Divorce rates point to a world that does not see much success in marriage. For instance, in Maldives, the divorce rate is so high that the UN calculated that the typical Maldivian woman, by the age of 30, has been divorced three times (Marriage Advice). What are the causes of these high divorce rates? There are 10 main causes we can discuss.\n\nExtramarital affairs is the main reason for divorces (Oliver). Infidelity causes anger and resentment among those who are married, and often tears apart the emotional connection couples have. Though one event of infidelity can be tackled through counseling, multiple accounts of extramarital affairs usually result in divorce.\n\nAnother main reason why people get divorced is money. Different spending habits, opposite financial goals, and a lack of money can produce great strain on a marriage (Oliver). If the couple has children, money becomes even more vital to the sustainability of the relationship.\n\nThough it may seem minor, a lack of communication is another key reason for divorce. If one or both partners in the marriage feel they cannot express themselves properly, or feel they are not being listened to, resentment can easily settle in (Oliver). Yelling and interrupting are common signs that a couple is not communicating well.\n\nSome people cannot stand the amount of arguments they have with their partners. If couples are bickering constantly, the joy of marriage cannot show through (Oliver). Arguments commonly stem from not being able to understand another person’s view, which is essential in a healthy relationship.\n\nUnfortunately, weight gain leads to many divorces. Say if a couple started out as both skinny, and one partner became overweight, the attraction to that partner might be lost. That loss of attraction causes many to turn in divorce papers, as they cannot fathom staying in a relationship with someone they do not feel comfortable with in a romantic way (Oliver).\n\nAnother prominent cause of divorce is unreasonable expectations (Oliver). It is good for the partners in marriage to discuss each other’s expectations before signing the matrimony papers, as partners often have varying expectations of what the marriage entails, and the positions the partners will hold in it. Sometimes one partner will have lofty expectations for the marriage without his or her partner realizing it.\n\nThough love should be the overriding reason to get married, it seems, a lack of intimacy causes many couples to get divorced. The romantic, maybe even infatuated love that married couples feel in the beginning of their marriages eventually subsides. It is natural, but how the partners deal with this decrease in sexual contact often decides how the future marriage will pan out (Oliver).\n\nThough common sense, equality in marriages is not often achieved. Each partner should feel equal in the marriage, and not dominated. Though it is delicate balance, it can be accomplished. Those who cannot achieve this often ask for a divorce, as they feel they are being shackled by his or her marriage instead of feeling a sense of joy and happiness from the relationship (Oliver).\n\nAlas, some people are not prepared for marriage. Many people rush to get married in a romantic frenzy without taking in the consequences of such an action (Oliver). They could be unprepared in terms of financial stability, emotional stability, and mental stability. Surprisingly, the age group with the highest rate of divorce are people in their 20s (Oliver). So, when getting married, be sure that you feel that everything is set for the occasion.\n\nA sad fact about marriages is that with emotional, physical, and mental strain, abuse can follow. This abuse does not have to refer to only physical abuse, but also emotional and psychological abuse (Oliver). Abuse can come from both men and women, and should not be thought of only as an attack against women, however women are subject to most of the physical abuse that occurs.\n\nAs you can see, the cause of divorce is multifaceted. Though one issue might put enough pressure on a marriage for the couple to go for a divorce, commonly a combination of problems arise that lend to the couple pondering the end of their relationship. Through infidelity, money issues, a lack of communication, constant arguing, weight gain, unrealistic expectations, a lack of intimacy, a lack of equality, a lack of preparedness, and abuse, marriages are broken. It is important for couples, therefore, to get counseling when any of these issues arise.###"}
{"prompt":"How common are police killings of citizens in the U.S.?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In the U.S., police killings of citizens is a common occurrence. In fact, U.S. police kill more people in days than some countries do in years (Lartey 2015). The extent of the issue is not restricted to this fact, however. Let us look at this conundrum in depth.\n\nBy the account of statistics, the U.S. in an outlier when it comes to police killings. To look at the scale of the problem properly, one can compare the city of Baltimore and the whole of country of England, including Wales. Baltimore has a population of 622,000, whereas England and Wales has a combined population of 56 million. The staggering point in all this is that between 2010-2014, there were only 62 people that died in police custody in England and Wales, whereas in Baltimore, 31 people died in the same time period. This makes it 50 times more likely to be killed by police in Baltimore than in England and Wales combined (News 2017). Another startling fact is that “In the first 24 days of 2015, police in the US fatally shot more people than police did in England and Wales, combined, over the past 24 years” (Lartey 2015).\n\nNow let us move onto more detailed information. According to the Washington Post, which keeps a count of every police killing in the U.S., “More than half of the people shot and killed by police were armed with a gun, while 1 in 20 were unarmed” (Washington Post). This shows that weapons were involved in the majority of cases, however 1 in 20 people being killed by police when they are unarmed in still unnerving, especially when 963 people were killed in 2016 by police. That comes out to about 48 people killed last year who were unarmed and caused no immediate threat to the police. That is more people killed by the police in some countries for years (Washington Post).\n\nWhat is perhaps even more disturbing is that the U.S. police force hardly ever get convicted for their fatal crimes. For example, in South Carolina, officers have shot at civilians 210 times in the last five years without a single officer being convicted (Howard, Greg). This trend appears in most states in the U.S., where no or hardly any police officers get tried for their crimes. This means that police have the leverage to outweigh the law that regular citizens abide by.\n\nThough the amount of police killings in the U.S. are atrocious, the rate at which people are being slaughtered by the police is only rising. According to the FBI, the rate of justifiable homicides by law enforcement using a firearm has risen steadily since the year 2000, and that is only the justifiable cases (Contorno, Steve). In the last two years, as a measure of overall killings by the police, 995 people were fatally shot by the police in 2015 and 963 people were fatally shot in 2016 (Washington Post).\n\nThere seems to be no end in sight when it comes to slowing down the rate of law enforcement homicide in the U.S. Though the U.S. has more police killings than any other country in the world, President Donald Trump wants to further militarize the police (Jarrett, Laura). Maybe it is time for the U.S. government to consider the widespread retraining of officers, and the demilitarization of police. Either this, or the law enforcement of the U.S. will continue its terror upon the citizens they have sworn to protect.###"}
{"prompt":"How does the act of writing fiction based on one's own life experiences affect the way in which the writer is perceived by others?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" William Gaddis’ attack on the institution and on the entertainment industry, in his posthumous novel, Agapē Agape, claims that there is a ‘whole supified mob [that is] turning the creative artist into a performer (…) the man in place of its work’. Aside from the fact that a performer can be a creative artist as well, what William Gaddis was trying to warn us about was how too much importance was being given to the living subject, the person and its actions, and less to his work. No one cares how Marcel Proust was as long as we have A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu. Likewise, it is of no importance at all that William Faulkner was a drunkard, or that William Burroughs was a lifelong heroin addict. What stands, what remains, is their work, not their fascinating personalities. Nevertheless, none of these writers, with the exception of William Gaddis, who thoroughly wrote about it, lived in the post-Microsoft age: until recently, information travelled neither quite as widely nor quite as quickly as it does now. These days, we are confronted with endless biographical titles, albeit some of them more fictionalised than fiction, since writers’ lives are seen as being as important as the work itself, if not more important.\n\nStill, the notions of biography and fiction are close to each other, so much that one could easily state that all fiction is biographical and all biography is fictional. It is not surprising, then, when writers use their own lives as the subject material for their fiction. They recreate their own predicaments in their characters, weaving together fact and fiction.\n\nLooking at Philip Roth’s novel, My Life as a Man (1970), the reader is told by the narrator, who, conveniently, is also a writer, about his relationship with a woman he hates, but because of his upbringing is unable to break up with. At one point, he is telling how she lured him into thinking she was pregnant ‘[she] took a specimen of her urine to the drugstore for the pregnancy test—only it wasn’t her urine (…) She approached a pregnant Negro woman pushing a baby carriage and told her she represented a scientific organization willing to pay the woman for a sample of her urine’. In the follow up of this sequence, he continues, ‘I want you to marry me regardless of how the test comes out tomorrow (…) I would do my best to make it appear that in marrying her I had acted out of choice rather than necessity’. This, naturally, was and is sold as fiction—nicely concocted fiction.\n\nEighteen years later, in Philip Roth’s autobiography, The Facts, the reader is confronted with the following sequences, ‘the urine specimen that she submitted to the drugstore for the rabbit test was purchased for a couple of dollars from a pregnant black woman she’d inveigled one morning into a tenement across from Tompkins Square Park’; and, ‘without doubt she was my worst enemy ever, but, alas, she was also nothing less than the greatest creative-writing teacher of them all, specialist par excellence in the aesthetics of extremist fiction (…) Reader, I married her’.\n\nThese examples taken from Philip Roth’s repertoire illustrate thoroughly the relation between fact and fiction, and the act of writing both. Here, there are three temporal moments to be considered when looking at the relations between biography and fiction, a) the time when it happened, b) the time when it was fictionalised and c) the time when it was written as an autobiography.\n\nMany other examples could be summoned, both from other writers and from Philip Roth’s own oeuvre. And the question arises, is it necessary, in order to have creative vigour, to lead a troubled life? Well, not necessarily. Many writers, and examples could easily come from the science-fiction genre, did not have to endure the predicaments present in their characters and their plots in order to write. Furthermore, normalcy, or middle-class bourgeois normalcy, is, these days, predicament enough. Still, each individual’s account, in fiction or real life, is full of drama because it is one’s own.\n\nNotwithstanding, the act of using one’s own experience to write fiction is not to transform oneself into a celebrity or to transform one’s fiction into mere entertainment; it is not, by and large, to put the man in the place of the work. The transitional movement from fact to fiction, from personal to universal, when successful, is a subjective emanation to the artistic.###"}
{"prompt":"What technologies that we use today will be gone within the next five years?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" All of us have witnessed technologies go into oblivion. Every five-ten years, a technological device becomes obsolete and vanishes, substituted by a more advanced and efficient analogue. CD players are an example of this process: in the beginning of the 2000s, every teenager owned one; nowadays, it is difficult to find at least one person who would prefer a CD player over an iPod. CDs, floppy disks, push-button cell phones, pagers, paper organizers—hardly anyone uses them anymore. These technologies have become vintage items that only collectors are interested in. Logically, even though we may consider certain technology to be top-notch and hi-tech, within the next five years, it might disappear in the same way the aforementioned cassette players did.\n\nOne of such devices is ATMs, as well as credit cards and check books. Unexpected? Not really. According to a report from First Data, about 94% of consumers under 35 years prefer using online banking systems; one fifth of this number of people have never signed a paper check for payment. Just in the United States, the frequency of using paychecks has dropped by 57% percent in the years between 2000 and 2012; as for European countries, paychecks are not used there. With mobile payments having become extremely easy to make and with financial operations gradually migrating online, within the following five years, checks could become obsolete. Perhaps the only sphere where paychecks are still being used is with real estate and property renting, although property companies incline towards using electronic payments as well. Considering how popular electronic finance is becoming, it is logical to expect cash operations to become obsolete—and when it happens, ATMs, credit cards, and other similar technologies will become useless (TechCrunch).\n\nPasswords and the principle of building electronic security around them is expected to disappear as well. It may be difficult to believe that within five years there will be no need to memorize dozens of complicated passwords for work and personal accounts, Facebook, banking systems, smartphones, laptops, and other technologies—the access to which we nowadays protect with security codes. However, it is enough to simply take a look at what security measures Apple, Meizu, and other vendors offer in order to understand what kind of future awaits security systems. Biometric data—this is what is going to protect our work and personal information soon enough. Today, almost any high-quality smartphone has a fingerprint scanner (so do laptops, even older models): you only have to press a button, and the system will recognize you as the legitimate owner of the device you are using. Moreover, every laptop or computer has a camera, so it can be expected that there will be software allowing our devices to read our retina, facial features, and other biometric information confirming identity. Even vehicles and banking systems might use this technology within the next five years, so the times when the password was the most dependable protection are probably ending (TopYaps).\n\nDigital cameras—those handy devices everyone used to take with them when going camping or when people went on a family trip—are already becoming obsolete, even though manufacturers still try to impress customers with novelties, such as even more image resolution, or the possibility to change a focus point on an image after taking a photo. However, since Apple released iPhone 4 in 2010, it has become clear that digital cameras are going to gradually lose popularity. Indeed, with such cameras as those installed on the recent iPhone models, or even with those used in flagman Android devices, who would want to pay extra money for a stand-alone digital camera (Time)? However, this does not relate to DSLR-cameras (digital single-lens reflex cameras) produced by such giants as Nikon, Canon, Leica, and so on. DSLR-cameras are highly advanced tools used for professional photoshooting; with their help, a huge number of creative challenges can be accomplished, and no phone camera provides the same flexibility, versatility, quality, and reliability as even the cheapest cropped DSLR camera.\n\nThe USB flashdrive is yet another piece of technology that we will probably see vanish in the closest future. Although they are extremely handy (especially when we need to transfer vast amounts of data), research conducted by Ericsson Mobile shows that their popularity will go down; by 2020, more than 70% of Earth’s population is expected to be using smartphones—and there are no USB ports in them. Instead, companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google actively develop cloud information databases, allowing billions of users to store data on remote servers instead of having to keep them on devices. Possessing an account on one of such cloud databases lets a user access his or her information anywhere, anytime, and from any device. A user must pay the rental price for using cloud storages, but the costs are affordable. Therefore, USB flash-drives will become unneeded rather soon (Tech Crunch).\n\nThroughout the recent decade, many technologies have emerged and disappeared almost without a trace. CDs, tape recorders, pagers, and other gadgets that seemed to be indispensable have been forgotten. But how about the technologies we rely on today? According to research, it can be expected that devices we got used to—USB flashdrives, digital cameras, security passwords, and even ATMs and credit cards—will be gone within the next five years. There is no need to worry though: with the current pace of technological development, there will be better, more efficient analogues for these technologies.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the key features of entrepreneurial resilience?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are many ways of earning money and gaining self-realization in the modern western world. Rather often, these two needs are connected: people actualize themselves through choosing occupations which fit them, or which they like, and which can bring them income. In these terms, it does not matter how a person makes a living exactly—be it a regular office job, freelancing, or business, the main criteria for choosing a profession and staying in it are whether it brings in money, and whether an individual likes what he or she is doing. And though there is nothing bad about office jobs, many people nowadays prefer freelancing or starting their own businesses. The latter is probably the most adventurous, and, in the case of failure, an entrepreneur may find himself or herself at a crossroad, choosing between giving up or trying again—and even though failure in business may be a painful and disappointing experience, many entrepreneurs incline towards the second option. Why? Due to the phenomena, or quality, known as entrepreneurial resilience.\n\nThe first step towards understanding entrepreneurial resilience would be to define the concept of resilience itself. This word (or the word phonetically similar to it) exists in a number of European languages—English, French, Spanish, and German, in particular—although its meaning remains approximately the same. In its narrow meaning, resilience is related to the ability of physical objects to regain its original shape after deformations. In a more “social” and broad context, resilience can be defined as the ability of an individual to withstand hardships, and life and career setbacks without delving into despair and\/or giving up. What is important here is that a resilient person not only withstands difficulties courageously (otherwise it would be closer to martyrdom), but also is able to recover from pressure and start all over again, considering the experience gained during the previous enterprise (Annals of Innovation & Entrepreneurship). In this regard, we can see that resilience is a crucial psychological trait for any entrepreneur, since, as we know, starting one’s own business is not always about achieving success, but mostly about the ability to face and overcome obstacles—many of which can be stressful and potentially ruining.\n\nSo, based on the definition above, entrepreneurial resilience can be understood as the ability to overcome and recover from stress caused by hardships and\/or failure in business, and to build a new venture, having learned from the mistakes made previously. Undoubtedly being a great trait, entrepreneurial resilience is something one can develop, which is good news for those who want to start their own businesses, but worry about being able to bear obstacles: there are several key features successful (and resilient) entrepreneurs possess—and each of them can be worked on.\n\nGenerally, they can be divided into three groups: the way a person perceives the world around them; activities one takes; and the way of communication with other people. Entrepreneurial perception is based on the sense of personal responsibility, personal beliefs, and optimism. The sense of responsibility implies that it is the entrepreneur himself or herself who causes something to happen or not happen in his or her life. A person with the sense of personal responsibility sees his or her achievements and failures not as a result of extraneous circumstances, but rather as a result of the application of one’s skills and talents, and as a product of inner motivation. Instead of relying on luck, beneficial environments, or the goodwill of other people, an entrepreneur applies his or her skills and talents in the area he or she wants to succeed in, gaining control over difficult situations and admitting that outcomes directly correspond with the amount of effort and motivation spent. Personal beliefs may differ depending on a person, but in general, they serve as additional support and motivation; for example, a person may believe that what he or she is doing is for the greater good, and gain additional confidence through this. Optimism, in its turn, is crucial for being able to interact with the world openly, in a positive manner, without expecting it to be mean and hostile; it is important that such optimism remains realistic, which means that an entrepreneur is still aware of challenges and difficulties awaiting him or her (Business 2 Community).\n\nThe way an entrepreneur acts is the second component of entrepreneurial resilience, and includes a goal-oriented approach to life, problem-solving skills, and the capability of self-support. The goal-oriented approach means that having decided what an entrepreneur wants to achieve, he or she develops a vision of how to do it, and is able to analyze resources, tendencies, and actions which are related to accomplishing this goal. Also, a goal-oriented entrepreneur is flexible enough to adjust his or her behavior in accordance to unexpected changes occurring on the path towards the goal. Problem-solving generally implies the ability to approach problems in a systematic way, without panicking or blatantly rushing through. An entrepreneur with great problem-solving skills can analyze a problem, define its key aspects, develop a plan addressing each of these aspects, and act accordingly, thus minimizing the problem or solving it completely. Finally, self-support includes self-assurance (the belief one has all the necessary qualities, talents, and resources needed to succeed) and self-composure—the ability to withstand and manage stress, approaching difficulties rationally, and restraining from acting under the influence of emotions (Business 2 Community).\n\nThe communication skills necessary for any entrepreneur include developing a diverse and supportive social network, and the ability to initiate contact with other people and keep doing so. The former is crucial during hard times; when there are many people whom an entrepreneur has established close personal and\/or business relationships with, overcoming harsh times can be much easier; the latter implies that an entrepreneur is able to communicate with others in a courageous and open way, freely expressing his or her ideas, expectations, and opinions. Such direct communication is necessary for resolving personal and business conflicts, and is a key element in developing the aforementioned supportive network (Business 2 Community).\n\nAs we can see, entrepreneurial resilience is a valuable quality everyone starting their own business should possess or develop. Being, in general, the ability to withstand difficulties and rise after failures, entrepreneurial resilience comprises various skills related to how a person communicates with others, solves problems, and perceives the world. These skills can be developed, so those who would like to start their own business might want to work on some of these traits.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the role of beauty in art?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The question of beauty in art has, over the past few years, come more and more into question. Both critics and philosophers alike have been reassessing the modern trends of seeing beauty in art as archaic and démodé, with Professor Roger Scruton being the most vocal. In his recent essay, Why Beauty Matters, Professor Scruton argued that our ability to truly appreciate beauty has been lost in the midst of self-aggrandising conceptual art and trumped up desires for utility over aesthetics, pointing to Marcel Duchamp, who sought to devalue art as an object, as the catalyst for this steady slip into a swamp of feculent imagery and lubricious ideologies. For something which has been the basis of Western civilisation since the time of ancient Greece, Scruton says, we have now created a world where ‘beauty and good taste have no place in our lives’.\n\nBefore Duchamp and the dramatic shift which Western art was to take, it was the civilised smile of the Enlightenment, taking the place of the sacred, which inspired artists, writers and poets, drawing on the beauty that emanated from the nature that surrounded them. With every artistic movement, the core aim was always the same: to project the beauty of human life and the world around in different ways—not, as the artists of the modern age have sought to do, to debase the human being and his world as ugly and ultimately pointless.\n\nIf we look at the 20th century, the demise of appreciation for artistic beauty and civility is nowhere so clear as in the all-around dismissal of the Parisian artist and founding member of Les Nabis, Pierre Bonnard, who throughout the 1920s and 1930s created some of the most astonishingly beautiful paintings of the century, his seminal work being ‘Nu dans le bain’ (‘Nude in the bath’) now on show at the Musee d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. It is one of the most undervalued artistic masterpieces of the 20th century. Completed by Bonnard in 1937, its sense of visionary purity is overwhelming. His intricate compositions, layers, and use of vivid colours inspired by Paul Gauguin make the mundane scene come to life with an almost blinding beam of sensuality. Bonnard, unlike the majority of his contemporaries, did not see the classical artistic canon as in any way moribund, but as inspirational, and this attitude is most clear in ‘Nu dans le Bain’ which is not just a beautiful piece of art work, but a love letter to both his wife and muse Marthe Boursin (who though in her sixties at the time, still radiates with ethereal youthfulness) and to the history of art itself.\n\nIn 1909, a prominent member of the Futurist movement, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, proclaimed ‘a roaring motor car, which runs like a machine-gun, is more beautiful than ‘The Victory of Samothrace’ a statement which carried weight for a number of years. In 2009, however, a hundred years on, the Turner Prize, Britain’s most esteemed art prize, was given to the Scottish installation artist Richard Wright, for what was an immense blast of much needed beauty in an otherwise stale world of unmade beds and blood-stained dolls. Upon seeing Wright’s work, a dazzling explosion of serpentine twists and swirls in gold leaf covering a wall inside the Tate gallery, which exuded an almost dream like air of intense emotion, the Poet-laureate Carol Ann-Duffy said ‘it is pure poetry, a link between image and imagination’. Wright’s expertise in creating such a masterpiece is in its self worthy of the old masters, using the techniques of Renaissance fresco-making.\n\nIn 2010, it is safe to say that a shift is occurring once again, this time, away from the vacuous and the obscene; an ever-increasing sense of ‘de nouveau’ is now surging through the citadel of contemporary art. As the art critic Alastair Sooke pointed out, ‘Art can be many things, but one of its most important functions is surely its capacity to console in times of crisis, to lift the spirit, and inspire people to carry on. This, I believe, is what we are experiencing today’.\n\nEarlier this year, the Paris-based artist Baptiste Debomberg exhibited a mesmerising creation titled ‘Aggravure’ displayed in a small back street warehouse. Created with 35,000 staples fired with a nail gun onto white plasterboard, it was his interpretation of Icarus, the Protagonist and mythical son of Daedalus, taking inspiration from the Dutch artists of the early Baroque, Hendrik Goltzius and Cornelisz Van Haarlem, fusing together the themes of artistic fragility with sublime power, exuding sensual beauty and artistic supremacy. The exhibition drew much attention from the contemporary art hierarchy, who hailed it a modern masterpiece. Debomberg is an artist on the cusp of his career; he is part of a new breed, who, like Wright, is laying the ghost of Duchamp and all he stood for to rest, finally respecting the classical artistic traditions, without fear of ridicule from a dismissive clerisy.\n\nBoth Wright and Debomberg have shown us that a need for beauty as a spirit soaring remedy to our cruel and capricious world is an essential component for human survival.\n\n————\n\nWritten under a Creative Commons License, with edits: https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/1.0\/###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of bionic eye implants?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Prosthetics have existed for hundreds of years. All of us are familiar with the stereotypical image of a pirate: a one-eyed bandit with a wooden leg, a hook instead of a hand, and a black patch across one eye. Nowadays, hooks and wooden legs may seem primitive, since much more advanced prostheses have appeared on the market: artificial limbs that can be connected directly to a person’s neural system are gradually becoming mundane reality; such prostheses allow users to directly control artificial limb movements, as if they were their own “original” arms or legs. This is not to mention artificial hearts, kidneys, and even bones. Simultaneously, for a long time, there was an organ the functions of which could not be recreated with the help of even the most advanced technologies: the human eye. The human eye is an incredibly complex biological lens, a window through which our brain perceives the world and gathers up to 90% of the information about it—so there is no surprise that scientists all over the world have tried to create fully functional eye prostheses—and recently their efforts finally started to bear fruit.\n\nIn 2016, the British National Health Service (NHS) announced that it was ready to pay for 10 people to become pioneers in the matter of testing the brand new technology of the “bionic eye”; these people (who had lost sight due to various circumstances) needed to undergo retina surgeries in order to be implanted with special devices—Argus II retinal implants, manufactured by Second Sight Medical Products in California, USA—enabling patients to distinguish light from dark, and recognize movement. Perhaps not as awe-inspiring as many would have probably expected, this technology is still a huge step towards creating an artificial analogue of an eye. So far, Argus II technology consists of retina implants, eye-gear, and a portable computer. Eyeglasses record the scenes around a user, sending imagery to a computer worn on a belt; the computer then processes these images, and wirelessly sends them to the electrode array implanted into a patient’s eye. This array then starts emitting short electric impulses, which bypass damaged retina fragments and reach the remaining cells capable of transmitting signals further to the brain. The brain then interprets received electric impulses, allowing a patient to “see” the world around them (The Guardian).\n\nWe are not talking about high-resolution color vision here; being far from emulating a real eye’s vision capabilities, Argus II still gives hope to many people who have lost their sight, allowing them to return to a normal life. Not being a panacea for all eye diseases (Argus II was developed to help people suffering from retinitis pigmentosa—a crippling disease causing people to completely lose sight in a matter of several years), the technology allows its users to see low-resolution flickering black and white dots; these dots let people see walls, lights, and even facial outlines. One of the happy implant users, Fran Fulton, who was implanted with the technology in 2014 after 15 years of blindness, says: “When I turned on the glasses, it was an “Oh my God’ moment. I was able to spot things on the wall and see people come in the room. I was able to walk right through the doorframe. It’s hard to tell a garbage can from someone sitting on the sidewalk, but I can go around it. I can now make decisions and maintain my independence” (The Optical Society of America). The technology is prospective and will probably develop, so that in a decade or so, it would be capable of reproducing imagery of a much higher quality than today. Besides, so far it is the only bionic eye technology approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, which means that it is available for purchase in this country (MIT Technology Review).\n\nIn fact, research in this direction has already been conducted for several years. In 2013, a German company, Retina Implant AG, was granted with a CE mark for its bionic eye technology called Alpha IMS. Having been developed for retinitis pigmentosa sufferers as well, Alpha IMS seems to be a more advanced and mobile alternative for Argus II. Unlike the latter, Alpha IMS is a tiny microchip (only 3 square millimeters in diameter) implanted under damaged retina. The results of the implant’s clinical tests have been announced in 2017; they show that people using the implant have became more autonomous, and the quality of their daily life has improved. Alpha IMS allows users to track objects around them due to normal eye movements, without having to mount special eye gear, as in the case of Argus II. The implant also provides clearer vision, due to operating with the resolution capability of 1,500 microphotodiode-amplifier pixels. Retina IMplant AG currently develops an even more advanced version of the implant—it is called Alpha AMS, and its resolution capability reaches 1600 pixels. Tests will be conducted until the end of 2017 (The Optical Society of America).\n\nModern eye prosthetics is far from the level demonstrated by various science-fiction films, such as the recent “Ghost in the Shell.” The first commercial eye implant, Argus II, provides its users with only low-resolution black-and-white images constructed from dots; however, this is already enough to greatly increase the quality of life of these people, who had spent decades without seeing at all. Another prospective eye implant—Alpha IMS—provides higher resolution, but its tests still continue, and it is not yet available for purchase. Anyways, it seems that scientists have finally found the way to successfully emulate functions of one of the most complex organs in the human body—and hopefully, they will succeed with introducing even more capabilities.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the risks and rewards of contrarian investing?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Be it public opinion, fashion trends, or expressing one’s own opinion, when a person chooses to not follow the stream but rather forge his or her own path, he or she will almost invariably face resistance, and sometimes even significant losses. The latter is especially true in business; a capitalistic economy comprises a vast number of market trends emerging and vanishing every couple of months. Since capitalism is based on the balance of supply and demand, rather often, when a new consumer trend appears, many business professionals choose to invest in it while it is popular—such an approach guarantees income, and when the trend dissipates, there is always something new to invest in. However, there are also business professionals who do not like jumping into a hot stock, preferring a stable and coherent manner of managing business instead of chasing gains. Such people do not usually invest in novelties; on the contrary, they prefer investing in areas that are not trendy, but which can, if adequate effort is made, bring in income as well. Such an approach is called contrarian investing.\n\nTo be more precise, contrarian investing implies searching for market areas that are currently underdeveloped or have fallen out of public favor, and opting to invest in them and develop them, rather than chase profits possible to gain from in more “popular” or trendy market segments. Why? Because when a market “wakes up,” and attention is being paid to such unfavored segments, a contrarian investor will already be there. He or she would have already invested in it, consolidated his or her positions, and would be ready to satisfy the demand (MoneyWeek.com). For example, nowadays, almost everyone is using smartphones, having forgotten about push-button cell phones. Why would anyone want to use them when smartphones provide more possibilities? However, at the same time, there are many people who prefer old-fashioned buttons over trendy touchscreens. For example, elderly people may find it difficult to use hi-tech gadgets, and would appreciate a device capable of only making phone calls; or, people with dull sight (including, once again, elderly people) might need push-button gadgets with huge digits, symbols, and letters, so that they would never get confused by a tiny, unreadable font. Besides, smartphones are too fragile; an iPhone will not work in temperatures under -20C, for example, and if you drop it, it will break easily. At the same time, there are many people who need strong and reliable communication devices: alpinists, rescuers, builders, engineers, and so on. They often need waterproof and unbreakable phones capable of working in extreme conditions—and in these terms, even an ancient Nokia 3310 is better than a smartphone. So, considering all this (as well as a variety of other factors) a contrarian investor would invest in developing push-button phones and advertising them appropriately.\n\nContrarian investing can be seen as the aerobatics of business, as it requires an entrepreneur to possess specific skills, intuition, and analytical abilities, as well as the willingness to take risks—and the risks are many. For example, if you are buying a company that has reached its bottom, it does not mean that it will eventually grow; rather often, there is a depth to fall into even further. Besides, the time and resources you will need to make your investment profitable can be extensive. A contrarian investor must be able to both analyze the market properly, and to adequately evaluate his or her resources and capabilities (Barclays).\n\nA person planning to invest on a contrarian basis should consider certain principles. It is not enough to simply choose an unpopular segment of the market and pour money and resources into it. There are multiple factors an investor should be aware of; the following are the most basic ones. First of all, for a contrarian investor, it is important to remember that mass media cannot be a source of actual news: in the financial world, by the moment something hits newspaper headlines, the prices have already reacted and adjusted accordingly. Therefore, it is crucial that a contrarian investor does not rely on news sources, but is able to analyze and foresee market fluctuations in order to be one step ahead of the headlines and react to these fluctuations in time. It also matters to act oppositely to market trends; simply put, you need to buy when everyone is selling, and sell when everyone is buying. This way, you can gain prospectively-valuable assets for low prices, and when the market turns upside down and your purchase becomes demanded—this is when contrarian investing strategy pays off. It is also important to be able to see through economic bubbles: a trend that is quickly gaining momentum, and which many people build their incomes on. The thing is that bubbles tend to burst—unless it brings in money, almost no one thinks about this. As a contrarian investor, it is important for you to not rely on such bubbles, being able to notice and avoid them. Do not trust popular research published in newspapers—become a researcher, dig up all the information yourself, and have your own opinion. And finally, be prepared that even if your investment is prospective and potentially beneficial for everyone, it will take a much longer time for the market to notice it than if you were doing business in a more “mainstream” way.\n\nContrarian investing is a rather risky way of doing business, suitable mostly for experienced and skilled business professionals who have patience, self-assurance, and analytical wit. Betting on currently not-so-popular segments of the market, contrarian investors know that their time and effort will eventually pay off much more than if they were doing business in the regular way. Mostly depending on research and resources, contrarian investing implies going against trends and hype—but the outcomes of this are usually much more rewarding than following the direction everyone else does.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the main ways to protect data on mobile devices?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Living in the age of the Internet and mobile technologies gradually changes people’s mentalities. The simplicity with which you can search for any information you need is sometimes shocking: rather often, it is enough to insert a name of a person, and a search engine will show all the information about a user (sometimes including rather personal data, such as private photographs). Moreover, the fact that mobile applications almost always request access to personal data, such as a contacts list or a credit card number, raises numerous questions regarding security: “Where does the information about me go?” and “Who else can see my details?” So, it is logical that many people get more and more concerned about the protection of their personal data, and their privacy in general—especially when using mobile devices.\n\nIllustrating this statement is a study conducted by the Pew Research Center. According to this study, around 54% of mobile application users choose to not install an application (both on Android and iOS platforms) if they have concerns about the security of their data or privacy. 30% of users choose to uninstall an application that was already on their devices after discovering how much information the application accesses and possibly shares (Pew Research Center).\n\nThis research only shows how important it is for people to keep their data on mobile devices safe. Data security is protected by the law—at least in the United States. In particular, the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) requires organizations to maintain the confidentiality of data operations, and grants individuals the right to delegate their data to organizations regarding the protection of personal information. In other words, if a Google application accesses a person’s contacts list and credit card credentials, for example, the DPA obliges Google to keep this information safe from third parties, and guarantees a person the protection of their right to privacy. The Act operates with such terms as “personal data” and “sensitive personal data,” making a clear distinction between them. “Personal data” is a broader term, regarding any information about an individual, whereas “sensitive personal data” includes details about an individual’s political and\/or religious outlook, ethnicity, membership in governmental or non-governmental organizations, sex life, state of health (both physical and mental), family, and so on (Jisc). The DPA cannot cover all aspects of information use, but still, the legislative protection of individual rights for privacy is a huge step forward—crucial for the digital era we live in.\n\nAs for the technical aspects of mobile data management and protection, there are numerous encryption technologies that can protect a user’s data if it is stolen. How? The main principle of encryption is to scramble data in such a way that an unauthorized user—for instance, a hacker intercepting transmitted information—would not be able to read it; at the same time, encrypted information is easily available to the legitimate owner. The process of encryption involves using special algorithms (or ciphers) which entangle data, break it into chunks, and makes it incomprehensible in a number of other ways; in order to make data intelligible again, a key is required: usually, it is a piece of code that interprets the encrypted data. There are two aspects of data encryption: encrypting data transferred from one device to another, and encrypting data on a device itself. As for the former, many companies are currently working on enhancing the security of transferred data—for example, Symantec, DataMotion, and Proofpoint. Modern data security technologies include transmitting already encrypted messages and\/or data from one device to another with the following decryption: safe gateways for data transmissions created before sending\/receiving messages; virtual private networks (VPNs) used to eliminate or minimize the possibility of external interference, and ensure secure data transmission from one device to another within a network. These technologies are undoubtedly effective, but still need to be developed in order to remain adequate to counter ever-evolving cyber threats.\n\nOn the other hand, encrypting data on devices is a bigger challenge for the IT sphere. One thing is when a hacker intercepts a message; another thing is when a person’s phone is stolen—in this case, a pin code or graphic password cannot serve as reliable protection. Different companies producing mobile devices work on this problem in their own ways. For example, Apple devices working on iOS 5 used the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard, which allowed automatic data encryption on devices. It was enough to enable the Passcode Lock feature to ensure email and application security. Unfortunately, this technology did not work on videos and images, but Apple keeps improving their security standards and measures, so newer iOS versions will support more advanced encryption methods. With Android-based devices, their users have the possibility to use several Android enterprise features, as well as applications such as WhisperCore, which allows full on-device encryption (TechTarget).\n\nManaging and protecting data on mobile devices in the digital age is not an easy task. Different studies show that people are concerned about their privacy, preferring to not install or delete mobile applications which, as they suspect, can obstruct their confidentiality. There are certain steps taken in the direction of protecting personal data, both legislative and technological. The former refers to the Data Protection Act, regulating the relationships between organizations and users regarding the use of personal data. The latter, in its turn, comprises a number of ways that information can be protected both on devices and when transmitted from one device to another. Altogether, these methods provide a relatively strong protection of private data, but they need to be constantly modernized.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the role of marketing research in business?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In any sphere of life, it is important to be able to make well-informed decisions. The popular approach, “seize each moment,” is good mostly for movies; in real life, all the decisions we make have consequences for which we are fully responsible. So, before making a decision, it is advisable to conduct reconnaissance: gather information, study risks, gains, and other possible outcomes. This is especially crucial in business, where entrepreneurs and companies operate with budgets, invest in various projects, and are interested in gaining revenues. Managers responsible for the decision-making process understand the importance of such a scrupulous approach; respectively, for them, marketing research is one of the ways they can gather all the data necessary to make the best possible decision in every situation.\n\nSince the majority of people know what a market is, let us instead define marketing first. In general, the term “marketing” is used to name the process of exchanging offerings (exchanging implies providing goods or services for money). A more detailed definition comprises activities and institutions that are involved in the process of creating, communicating, and delivering these offerings to customers, partners, and society. For an exchange to occur, two conditions must be held: both parties participating in the exchange must have something of mutual value, and there must be certain relationships established between these parties. The former implies that a company or entrepreneur can satisfy customers’ needs, providing them with goods or services that can help customers solve their problems (the “right” principle: providing the right services for the right people). The latter means that before a customer purchases something from a company, he or she must become interested, or at least informed about this company and its goods and services. If you need a vacuum cleaner, most likely you will not go to a store and buy the first one you run into; instead, you will try to choose a brand you can trust, a brand known for producing vacuum cleaners of high quality. This image of a brand, formed in your mind—or, in other words, the relationship with the brand—is the result of marketing: for example, advertising and informational campaigns are run by companies regularly. The efforts of marketers are aimed at forming a positive image of a brand or company in your mind so that you would want to purchase their services. However, to be able to both build such a relationship and provide the “right services to the right people,” managers need timely information that can help them make proper decisions—and the main channel of such information is marketing research (Scribd).\n\nIt is difficult to underestimate the role of marketing research when you know what functions it performs and what use it brings to marketers. In particular, marketing research helps managers understand how people get to know about the goods and services provided by a company, and what defines the choices they make, recognizes the groups of consumers (potential customers) existing in a society, and shows distinctions between them—this helps companies avoid treating different groups in the same manner, instead of allowing them to develop a unique approach to each group. Marketing research is for examining the needs of each of these groups of customers and enabling companies to become able to satisfy them better. Due to marketing research, managers can decide on the optimal price for the products provided so that customers can purchase solutions for their needs; developing new concepts, sales, advertising strategies, and products, and ensuring that they will be demanded—this is also what marketing research allows managers to do. In addition, the information obtained during marketing research can help managers make their brand and\/or company distinctive, stand out, and be attractive to customers; it can also point out new and ongoing marketing trends and thus contribute to a company’s adjustability, as well as determine the direction in which a company can further develop (KoganPage).\n\nIf we compare the relationship between customers and brands to warfare, brand or company managers can be seen as generals, commanding armies and developing strategies. To perform their duties successfully, generals need reconnaissance: detailed information about enemy positions, intentions, and motives. In their turn, company managers need to know who needs what, why a person would want to purchase this or that good or service, and how clients’ behaviors can be predicted.\n\nMarketing is the process of developing, communicating, and delivering certain offerings to customers. The two main conditions for this process is that both parties participating in it possess something valuable for each other (usually it is a service or product in exchange for money) and that there is a relationship between them (commonly, it is a brand’s interest in customers and clients’ trust towards the brand). To meet these two conditions and be able to satisfy customers’ needs as fully as possible, managers running companies need detailed information about their customer’s habits, lifestyles, decision-making patterns, and so on. This information can be obtained by conducting marketing research, which makes this tool a valuable channel of information in the decision-making process.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the expectations of customers towards businesses?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Long have gone the times when business was all about making money no matter what. Of course, even nowadays we can witness profiteering, financial and ecological scandals involving big companies, squandering and ineffective CEOs clinging to their chairs, and so on; approximately four or five decades ago, few people would be surprised if they learned something like this about a big company. However, nowadays the situation has changed; customers and societies in general have started seeing businesses not just as a way of making money, but also as a necessary gear in social mechanisms—and thus, the expectations of customers towards businesses have changed as well. Almost any business today is required to follow not only certain laws and quality standards, but also a number of demands societies put in front of them. In other words, it is social accountability (or responsibility) that most companies are required to maintain and demonstrate in today’s world.\n\nBut what exactly is social accountability? To start with, the social aspect of responsibility companies bear is just one part of their accountability; modern companies’ accountability falls into three categories: economic, social, and environmental responsibility. Among these three, social accountability is the most topical one. It implies companies participating in the everyday life of a society, contributing to the solution of global social problems, such as hunger or the protection of rights, and making people’s lives better overall. This can be achieved through a thorough and honest performance of a company’s primary functions. What lies in the basis of the relationship between a company and a customer? Supply and demand. A customer has a problem and needs a solution for it—a company, in its turn, does its best to satisfy this need. Respectively, the first and foremost customer expectation regarding a company is a stable supply of high-quality goods and services. This expectation includes timely delivery, a respectful attitude, client support, fair prices and advertising, and a number of other aspects. If a company is able to stick to these principles, the reward for this will be profit and a good reputation—which, in the modern world, sometimes matters more than the quality or nature of the goods and services provided (Exforsys.com).\n\nThis is not all, however. The 21st century is the age of information in all senses, and respectively, customers expect companies to be open and provide all the information they need or want. With the emergence and development of social networks, more and more people have started to prefer to gather information via Facebook and other similar platforms. In particular, the research conducted by HubSpot shows that the absolute majority (95%) of millennials—people born after 1980 and coming of age in the new millennium—expect any company or brand to have a Facebook page. This expectation is also put forward by older generations—specifically, 87% of people aged between 30-44 years, and almost 70% of people aged between 44-60 years believe that companies must have accessible pages on Facebook. According to this research, even a Twitter, LinkedIn, or YouTube presence is not as important for customers as Facebook. Such a requirement can be explained by the impression a company makes on customers, depending on whether it is presented in social networks, or not; in particular, running accounts on social platforms is a good sign of a company’s transparency, readiness for dialogue with clients, and reliability (Social Media Examiner).\n\nWhy do they need it? For communication, problem solving, and consultations—as well as for the opportunity to review and comment on goods and services provided by a brand or company. This is not the same as a common support service; communication through social networks is more like peer-to-peer communication, so it is already not enough for companies to simply reply to their customers’ inquiries: such communication should also include the elements of friendliness and entertainment, and should not always be connected to sales. According to the aforementioned research, considering the fact that social platforms are designed mostly for personal communication, customers do not appreciate excessive amounts of sales-related content, but still tolerate other brand-related, unique content. Summing up, a socially-responsible company may want to meet the expectations of its customers not only in terms of the goods and services it provides, but also in regard to lesser requirements.\n\nConsidering all this, it can be said that the social accountability of a company is its readiness and willingness to provide its customers with high-quality products and services in a timely manner, give customer support, and keep its clients well-informed. This is direct accountability, whereas in a more global meaning, a company may be expected to contribute to the solution of human rights issues, dealing with famine, assisting the poor, educating people, and so on.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the consequences of companies not protecting the environment?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" No longer than a century ago, the problems of ecology concerned no one. Companies around the world pumped oil, dug out coal, killed whales for fat and bone, dumped waste into rivers and oceans, and did not think about the consequences all this could have on the environment. Nowadays, the situation has changed to the opposite: the problems of ecology are the subject of public attention, and companies are required to organize their production in such a way that they cause as little harm to the environment as possible. Although there still are a lot of people who somehow do not believe in global warming and the extinction of species, and tend to underestimate the outcomes of humanity’s vital and industrial activities, numerous research studies show they are wrong: all the environmental problems we hear about every day are indeed threatening the planet, and it is the task of every person on the planet to make it a cleaner and safer place. The same applies to business—large or small, industrial or service-oriented. In fact, there is a positive trend among the governments of many developed countries, obliging companies to protect the environment.\n\nIn the United States, there are numerous permits a company must get in order to proceed with its business. First comes Clean Air Permits, which must be obtained by all companies whose industries produce air pollution. Carbon dioxide, particles of heavy metals, and other substances that make air dirtier are emitted into the atmosphere every day, so there is a strong need to regulate the amounts of these emissions, as well as to oblige companies to constantly seek ways of making their industries cleaner and more efficient in terms of protecting the environment. Next is the Endangered Species Act, which aims to protect animals inhabiting areas that suffer due to human industrial activities. In particular, the Act prohibits and\/or limits the activities that threaten species, the population of which has decreased throughout recent years, and obliges companies to get a permit from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and other institutions protecting wildlife in the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. This regulates the procedures of treatment of hazardous wastes, and requires companies working with such materials to obtain state permits, proving that they are capable of proper waste storage and management. Besides, there are legislative norms regulating how companies should discharge waste waters, pollutants, and other substances in American water reservoirs, including wetlands and shorelines. These are just the basic acts and permits regarding environmental protection in the United States, but it can be easily seen how seriously the problem of ecology is treated (SBA).\n\nNaturally, companies that do not wish to comply these regulations can incur serious sanctions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has a number of enforcement programs, or, in other words, ways of making environmental violators comply. For example, the EPA’s cleanup enforcement program implies contacting the violator, negotiating with them to perform a cleanup (on their own, or using the services of other companies), and\/or making them pay a fee for contaminating the environment. Or, there is a number of civil and judicial procedures ensuring that a person or company responsible for contamination complies with the acts aimed at protecting the environment (EPA).\n\nHowever, companies choose to comply with the environmental regulations not only because of the fear of sanctions. There are many business professionals who feel the responsibility for the ecological condition Earth is in, and constantly seek ways to make their industries cleaner and more efficient in terms of protecting the environment. For example, a company may opt in favor of electronic document management, instead of using old-fashioned paper; or, a green-oriented company may want to recycle, manage its power consumption (turning off air conditioners and personal computers in the office when no one is there can save a lot of energy), build its offices from environmentally-friendly materials, and cooperate with other companies oriented at saving the planet from contamination by all means possible (Ecopreneurist). Such companies promote their style of business, inspiring further generations of entrepreneurs to follow their track, thus contributing to making Earth a cleaner place.\n\nThere is a wide range of laws and regulations making sure companies protect the environment, or at least to minimize the negative impacts of their industrial activities on nature. The Environment Protection Agency of the United States, as well as other institutions, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have a number of enforcement measures forcing companies to comply with these regulations, starting from negotiations and paying fees, and onward to judicial means and sanctions. However, companies comply not only because of the fear of sanctions, but also due to the progressive way of thinking and personal responsibility that many modern open-minded CEOs and other business professionals possess.###"}
{"prompt":"How did the ancient Chinese view death and the afterlife?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Why did the Emperors of the Qin and Han dynasties obsessively pursue immortality? It would be a relatively simple question if there existed at the time some uniform body of authoritative ideas on such matters. But the centuries that mark China’s transition from a loose confederacy of feudal kingdoms into an empire were marked by tempestuous struggles over the appropriate operating principles for a historically-unprecedented political entity.\n\nThe ancient Chinese saw man ‘as being made of a body joining two souls together. Whereas the hun soul came from the sky and returned to it, the po soul derived from the earth and fell back into it’ (1). John Keay has written of the First Emperor that, ‘A ruler’s first responsibility was to his lineage—past, present, and to come. In honouring his ancestors, he anticipated his becoming one of them and so demonstrated the legitimacy of his succession and that of his heirs’ (2). In other words, it was believed that one’s safe passage into the spiritual realm was facilitated by assistance from ancestral spirits, which was secured by observing the ancestral rites: ‘Ancestors were cherished not just as loved ones but as progenitors deserving of the Confucian respect due to all parents, and as intermediaries in any dealings with the spirit world’ (3). This chain of cosmic interdependency reflected the social hierarchy on Earth, so the tombs of emperors and their officials were grandiose in order that their status would be duly acknowledged in the spiritual realm; if they were not, then the ranks of masses beneath them would have faced uncertainty after death, and would have wasted their lives observing official rituals.\n\nThis helps to explain the epic scale on which these imperial mausoleums were executed. They were microcosms of the material world vacated by their occupants, as demonstrated by the extraordinary range of everyday objects on display—from decorated door-knockers to jade boardgame pieces, an early ginger-grater, a skin exfoliator, and a minimalist stone lavatory. They were all excavated from tombs that mirrored, in form and function, the original palaces. One imperial mausoleum yet to be excavated is described in the official histories as a microcosm of the emperor’s vast domains, with rivers and lakes of mercury and a jewel-studded ceiling depicting the night sky. The undeniable centrepieces of the exhibit are two magnificent Han-period ‘jade suits’: tight-fitting suits of armour made of over two thousand small jade platelets stitched together with thread of gold, silver or silk. Jade was thought to have preservative properties, so these suits were designed to protect their royal wearers in the spirit world.\n\nThe Qin First Emperor (Shi Huangdi) was so obsessed with death after three attempts on his life that he made death a taboo subject at court, its mere mention punishable by death. As the first of his kind, his power and authority always seemed insecure and lacking in roots, so he turned to the doctrines of legalism to provide an ideological framework. For a long time, scholars had associated legalism with draconian punishments and authoritarian laws, but archaeological finds in the 1970s have given us a more balanced picture. The justice system embodied pessimism about human nature but legalism was nothing if not pragmatic. Everything was valued insofar as it strengthened the central state.\n\nHe grounded his claim to rule—and the legalist measures necessary to buttress it—in the Daoist theory of the ‘Five Phases’. This holds that history is a recurring cycle of elemental phases—earth, wood, metal, fire, and water—in which each overpowers the other in turn. Significantly, this theory is a fatalistic counterpoint to the Confucian idea of the ‘Mandate of Heaven’, which posits that a ruler’s legitimacy derives not from the mechanical rotation of elements but from the agency of intervening spirits signalling disapproval through natural disasters.\n\nSo, there was a milieu of competing ideologies in China at the turn of the first millennium. The First Emperor’s response to the creeping influence of feudal ideas amongst his advisers was to issue an edict ordering the burning of all books which were neither for practical instruction nor politically correct. He came to believe that all the great achievements of his reign—the river-management projects, roads, and defensive barriers effected through mass mobilisation—might be destroyed in the political instability that the ‘Five Phases’ theory predicted would follow his death, as the ‘rule of water’ was dammed by earth. Thus, the First Emperor lavished vast expenditure on procuring life-prolonging elixirs from various sorcerers and miracle-men, and dispatched two unsuccessful expeditions by sea in the hope of finding the Islands of Paradise, which were thought to be inhabited by immortals.\n\nThe only way to cheat history would be to cheat nature, or at least conceal it from the masses. Thus, he sealed off his palaces with closed walls and corridors, and made his whereabouts a sworn secret: ‘Removing himself from public sight was supposed a step towards transcending the passage of time’ (4). If he could not physically cheat death, he at least wanted to trick his people into thinking he had. When he expired, possibly after a self-administered toxic potion of cinnabar, the news was suppressed, ironically, by scheming eunuchs who wanted time to plan their course of action first; they continued delivering meals to his carriage and positioned a wagon of fish nearby to mask the stench.\n\nThe First Emperor’s quest for immortality had been in vain, but the ideas which shaped and were shaped in turn by that imperative had some undeniably beneficial effects at a crucial stage in the history of Chinese civilisation. The sense of urgency and ambition that sprung from a curious blend of Daoism and legalism can be seen as a dialectical reaction against cautious and conservative tendencies in Confucianism (which specified responsibilities according to social position and tended to naturalise the social hierarchy). The Han dynasty that succeeded the Qin gradually built the model imperial state that would last for almost two thousand years on a foundational synthesis of Confucianism with elements of statist ‘realism’.\n\nBesides the search for immortality, another key theme of the exhibition is factional politics in the Han dynasty and in particular the power-struggle between the Han imperial family in the northern ‘cradle’ of Chinese history, with its capital at Chang’an (modern Xi’an) and the Kingdom of Nanyue (‘Southern Yue’), with its capital at Panyu. What distinguished Nanyue from the other kingdoms—which were rendered increasingly dependent on Han patronage—was that it owed nothing of its authority to Han Gaozu and harboured its own imperial ambitions (one of the jade suits on display in the Fitzwilliam belonged to the King of Nanyue). The critical moment came when King Wu of Nanyue declared himself an emperor; it would be nearly a hundred years before Han Wudi finally brought Nanyue to heel and converted his own dominion into a powerful empire. In the process, Han Wudi also became preoccupied with the allure of immortality. He retrospectively claimed to rule by the ‘earth’ that had overcome the Qin’s ‘water’, and revised the calendar to synchronise the dynasty with the Five Phases. As a consequence of this, he advanced a strange synthesis of Daoism, legalism, and Confucianism which, though lacking in intellectual coherence, struck a successful and durable balance of compromise and coercion.\n\nWhile emperors may have used ideology to rationalise their essentially selfish desire to cheat death, that is only part of the story. Equally important is: why they chose to choose particular ideologies for this purpose; how ideas were adapted in order to win support from rival claimants to supremacy; and how those adaptations ultimately eroded the original ideological rationale for prioritising the immortality of the emperor (at least in theory, the ‘Mandate of Heaven’ made the earthly claims of emperors more fragile).\n\nAlthough it is not the stated mission of this exhibition to tackle such questions, and although the individual displays are contextualised, the experience would be a more rewarding one if it gave a more vivid impression of how the spirit world was imagined in ancient China, and the significant ways in which philosophical canons, as well as thrones, were loci of conflict. Nevertheless, it is a rare opportunity to glimpse the rich and beguiling world that provided a backdrop to the ubiquitous terracotta soldiers. It should not be missed.###"}
{"prompt":"How did the invention of film change the way people experienced entertainment?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are multiple debates concerning the origins of film. Photographers in the nineteenth century were anxious to find a way to capture movement, almost from the moment they discovered the art of photography. It took less than half a century, and by the 1870s, Edward Muybridge has already made significant advances, managing with the use of the zoopraxiscope to exhibit successfully a series of moving images. Muybridge was a scientist, so for him the experiments did not serve an artistic purpose. That is why, despite their historical importance in the development of technology, his pieces are rather foreign to film as we understand it.\n\nThe birth of film as an artform can be pinpointed conveniently to 1895, with the first public exhibition of a number of one-minute single shots directed by the Lumière brothers. L’arrivée d’un train à La Ciotat [Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat] (1896) has all the attributes to earn it the accolade of being the first film, particularly as it was shown originally to a large audience. However, as the popularity of television and home video has proven, film spectatorship can also be solitary. The acceptance of film as a solitary experience, not only a collective one, has allowed the earlier mavericks (who only managed to offer screenings of their output to one spectator at a time) to claim the invention of the medium.\n\nThe recently discovered Roundhay Garden Scene (1888) is probably the earliest film, followed swiftly by works by two other Englishmen: William Friese-Greene working in the UK (1889), and William K.L. Dickson, the celebrated employee at Edison Manufacturing Company, in the USA (1890). These are all raw pieces, running several seconds, yet they all share two elements lacking in Muybridge’s work, namely a continuous rather than cyclical sequence, and most importantly the occurrence of certain emotional experiences to images that are potentially ideological in essence.\n\nPinpointing the true birth of film, as opposed to the conception of it, is therefore a more difficult task than one would expect. What is the first production that is both technically and ideologically essential for this early period?\n\nA case can be made for a little known and less celebrated production by William K.L. Dickson and his fellow cinematographer William Heise, Dickson Greeting. In a dark background, a man in his early thirties, Dickson himself, with a hat in his right hand, smiles and greets all of us. It is a simple greeting, yet it is impossible to resist taking the gesture as a symbolic welcome into the world of film.\n\nWilliam K.L. Dickson’s inventions of both the kinetograph and the kinetoscope stand as two of the most important developments in the industry. The convention that film should be 35mm wide is another of his essential decisions. Even the Lumière’s cinematograph is a slight improvement on Dickson’s work. Therefore, the solitary greeting, coming from the inventor himself, is all the more intriguing.\n\nAs opposed to the Lumière technique of recording social events as historical documents, from the very beginning, Dickson saw the potential of using the moving image to tell a story, primarily through performance. In Dickson Greeting, judging from the body language, he is clearly performing for the camera, aware of the effect this might have over the spectator. It is then to assume that the greeting into the world of motion pictures was fully intended by the filmmaker.\n\nA contemporary journalist from the New York Sun covering the first presentation of the kinetograph to a group of 147 members of the convention of women’s club in America in May 1891 remarked: ‘As they looked through this hole, they saw the picture of a man. It was a most marvellous picture. It bowed and smiled and waved its hands and took off its hat with the most perfect naturalness and grace. Every motion was perfect. There was not a hitch or a jerk.’\n\nFilm’s ability to reproduce naturalness seemed to have been noted at the dawn of the industry. However, Dickson was the one to develop this potential by consistently staging events to be filmed. The point was not to show the magic of motion pictures through visual effects, as pursued throughout the 1890s by Émile Reynaud and Georges Méliès, but to create sequences that looked like snippets of reality. The staging is less apparent in Dickson Greeting, although it is implied by the mere process of posing for the camera, but the directorial technique is evident in less successful pieces such as Men Boxing (1891), in which two men seem to do anything but box.\n\nOne other important element introduced in Dickson Greeting is the tradition of constructing a narrative through a single\/leading performer, in clear opposition to the contemporary European shorts, primarily concerned with establishing a social context. Hollywood, throughout most of the 20th century, rarely questioned the idea that individualism is intrinsic to American culture. Instead, it got hold of the concept and used it scrupulously, ultimately leading to severe criticism of single-mindedness and over-simplification of film narrative.\n\nOf course, such generalisations bring with them exceptions to the rule. However, the persistence of leading characters in early American film did create a certain cultural expectation in the audience that they should be able to identify with the emotions of a single individual, and through him or her to access universal ideas. Yet, this tradition was not necessarily the expression of a national trait, but was arguably a result of the technical limitations of the kinetograph, which did not make it easy to work with a large cast.\n\nThe sheer rawness of early film is often off-putting and can make the films seem uninteresting to modern audiences. However, it is precisely this crudeness that helps us identify the essential elements of film. Dickson Greeting is neither the first film, nor the most celebrated one, yet its symbolic magnetism of establishing film as a technical invention capable of developing a meta-linguistic artistic narrative, makes it as one of the most intriguing productions in the history of the medium. Dickson welcomed us; we could not resist the temptation to come in. We believed in his performance and allowed ourselves to be charmed by the illusion of motion pictures. In that, the film is unique.\n\n——–\n\nThis was written under a Creative Commons License, with edits:\nhttps:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/1.0\/###"}
{"prompt":"How did the Salvation Army come to be?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Among charity organizations existing currently, there is one that takes its mission so seriously that it sees itself as a military unit on duty. The Salvation Army—one of the most famous Christian charity organizations worldwide—is truly an army in many senses but one: instead of taking lives away, it attempts to save them, both physically and metaphysically.\n\nThe Salvation Army owes its existence to one man: William Booth, who founded the organization in 1865 in an attempt to relieve poor people in Britain from their misfortunes. At first, he preached in the streets of London, and as people listened to him, Booth directed them to nearby churches and chapels for food and a place to sleep. However, many of the poor could not find shelter because Victorian churches rejected them due to their extreme poverty, and “inappropriate” or “unorthodox” dress and habits; in order to solve this problem and provide the poor with a place to eat and sleep, Booth founded the East London Christian Mission. The term “Salvation Army” emerged later, when Booth was dictating a letter in which he compared believers to God’s army; as the name “Salvation Army” appeared, the goals and structure of the organization became clear: Booth called himself “The General of the Salvation Army,” and his wife Catherine became the “Mother of the Salvation Army.” A progressive trait of the organization—especially considering the fact that it appeared in Victorian Britain—was that women could participate with equal rights, so Catherine occupied the position of an ordained minister. In accordance with the organization’s name, each member had a rank similar to those existing in the army; regular church members were called soldiers, and those of higher ranks were ministers. The name “Salvation Army” reminds all of its members that they are on a mission: saving souls. Booth quickly realized that the last thing hungry and exhausted people think about is the salvation of their souls, so in order to keep up with the mission, he established the “three S” principle: soup, soap, salvation. The idea was that when people’s primary needs are satisfied, they can direct their thoughts and eyes to God. These principles are kept nowadays as well (GotQuestions).\n\nBooth did not want his church to be correlated with the existing religious traditions, so he eliminated all of the forms of outward religious observance. As for other outward symbols, the Salvation Army differed from other religious organizations greatly. It emulated the structure and charters of a military organization. In 1878, the organization adopted its first flag designed by Catherine Booth, and starting from 1880s, the organization began to establish its corps all over Britain. At that time, the Salvation Army already utilized military-like uniforms, ranks such as “cadet,” lieutenant,” “captain,” or “general,” and its own terminology; for example, the places of religious worship were called “outposts,” newly recruited members were “captives,” and Bible readings were “rations.” Such a fresh approach looked attractive to the masses tired of traditional preaching, so the Army increased in numbers quickly: by the beginning of the 1880s, there were 127 officers and 81 corps across Britain and overseas (VictorianWeb.org).\n\nThe Salvation Army’s religious doctrine is based on 11 principles, or the articles of faith.\n\nThese articles are:\n\nIn order to deliver salvation, the Army uses music (the famous orchestras marching around the streets of almost any big city in the world), propaganda, free food and shelter for homeless and those in need, and also sells cheap clothes and other goods through a network of shops, preaches, and helps people in a number of other ways. Members of the Salvation Army can be found almost anywhere where there is a disaster, and where people are desperately looking for help.\n\nThe Salvation Army is a charity organization founded by William Booth in London in 1865. His initial purpose was to help poor people find food and shelter, but when he noticed that Victorian churches often rejected these people because of their appearance and habits, he decided to establish an organization that would help them. Booth, as well as his wife, led the organization, established its structure, doctrine, and principles of work, and although there has been more than 150 years since its emergence, the Salvation Army exists today. This is probably the best proof of its efficiency and popularity in the world.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the role of the academy in society today?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" We live in times when the academy and education in general seem to be high on the agenda of governments and of cultural elites in the western world. And yet, there seems to be a great ambiguity in answering a simple question: what is the academy good for today? Various answers would treat the academy in a quite instrumental way, as a path to a promising career, as means to provide social mobility to the lower social strata, as a source of boosting the economy and even as an identity forming procedure (hence the emphasis placed on the ‘student experience’ by UK academic institutions). What is lost in all the above is the original purpose of the academy: the pursuit of knowledge and truth, the questioning of certainties and thus the expansion of a society’s horizons.\n\nThis predicament of the academy, and its alienation from its primary noble mission, has its roots in the political, ideological, and economic condition of our times: the shift in capitalism’s paradigm and its recent serious crisis, the influence of a set of ideas that has become known as postmodernism, and also the marketisation of education, leading to a managerial ethos alien to the academy’s quest for truth and excellence. Needless to say, all three factors are interconnected.\n\nThe opening of higher education to the masses took place in the Western world in the aftermath of the Second World War. A new massive middle class was rising to cover needs in the technical and bureaucratic domain, as well as to provide social services that were now available to almost everyone. This was the result of the privileged position that the working class, due to its strength, would find itself against capital at that time and also a characteristic of the state operating as a ‘collective capitalist’ and training the working force. On a more ideological level, the idea of rising up the social ladder through education was an important lure for the lower classes, which considered education as the means towards a promotion to the upper classes. Education had thus an instrumental role to play, although at that time, this appeared to be in the best practical interests of the majority.\n\nProcedures taking place in the last three decades have slowly changed the aforementioned pattern. On the one hand, as a general trend in capitalism, the demand for labour is diminishing. On the other hand, an economic stagnation strikes heavily on the working and middle classes, whereas the state is less and less willing to support these classes. The ‘surplus working population’ (obviously in a social and not a Malthusian way) that Marx had described is now not only including unskilled workers, but also highly-skilled labour and would-be members of the middle class, who in the times of crisis are absorbed in precarious forms of employment. This surplus labour power is useless to capital, not only as producers, but not even as consumers, as profit is more and more disconnected from the circulation of products in the ‘real’ market.\n\nObviously, young people want to avoid such a bleak future. Thus, education is suddenly becoming more and more a luxury and in uncertain times, an investment that is carefully and wisely made by the individual, on a risk-based approach and with emphasis on promises for a future pay back, in a precarious and demanding job market. This means the university is almost uniquely dealing with skills learning and training, which compromises the character and the ethos of academia. Sections of the academy such as philosophy, arts and politics, which in the past have significantly contributed in the widening of humanity’s horizons, are either surviving as an instrument for social policy, or are facing a total decay and even extinction. The pursuit of knowledge for its own sake is obviously lost somewhere in between these trends.\n\nBut the idea of the academy as a place for the pursuit of truth is also eroded by the intellectual atmosphere that seems to be prevailing in recent decades. Trends such as post-structuralism, cultural theory, identity politics, and so on promote an understanding of the world (or of multiple worlds) where there is no such thing as universal truth. A diversity of ‘knowledges’, particularism, and subjectivism question key notions of the Enlightenment such as reason, science, and universal truths and, thus, undermine the figure of the intellectual and of the academic. If there is no such thing as Truth, why bother discovering it in the first place? Of course the thing about truth is that if you are certain you have found it, you probably have not—but this does not mean that pursuing truth, while perhaps tentative and temporal, is not a worthwhile goal and the prerequisite for intellectual progress and humanity’s great leaps forward.\n\nThe third and most widely discussed factor leading to an undermining of the idea of the academy is the marketisation of education. This procedure has been critiqued, especially by the Left, on various grounds. Here I will focus on how it undermines the academy as an institution servicing knowledge. If the university is nowadays a business, the teacher is automatically transformed to a service provider and the student is a customer (and in cases such as in the UK, a customer that pays a lot). There is a phrase in Greece, saying that ‘the customer is always right’. This has profound implications in the academic procedure, undermining the role of the teacher in an era where scepticism towards adult authority is already creating uncertainties on the ontology of the pedagogic system. Education is a procedure which is often demanding, tiring, and dull. However, in order to avoid a harsh evaluation by an unsatisfied customer, the teacher might prefer to compromise academic standards in order to make his or her ‘product’ more appealing.\n\nAs the sociologist Frank Furedi has developed in his work, the provision of the ‘commodity’ that education is becoming is based on a pre-arranged agreement, a quid pro quo procedure where each side gives and takes in a narrowly-confined space. This means the questioning of the uncertainties and the promotion of ideas that might be heretical and outside a suffocating atmosphere of political correctness that prevails modern managerial world becomes difficult, if not impossible. Education becomes a ‘procedure driven’ experience, where how someone learns becomes more important than what he or she learns. Thus, we see that a huge amount of money, time, and energy is spent by the university for an army of experts, ‘learning enhancers’, human resources officers, and student union lobbyists who have nothing to do with anything regarding the pursuit of knowledge.\n\nIt is easy to understand that in a time of a global financial crisis, the zeitgeist is quite hostile to the idea of an academy servicing knowledge and the pursuit of truth. However, knowledge and truth are closely linked to the capacity of human beings to bring change and write history. And at the moment, we need these things more than ever.\n\n—\n\nWritten under a Creative Commons License, with edits: https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/1.0\/###"}
{"prompt":"The printed book is evolving.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" At the end of March, Joanne Harris’s latest novel Peaches was published in paperback. I say novel but perhaps the singular is misleading. The Peaches sitting next to the checkout at your local Tesco, or stored in an Amazon stockroom, will not be the same as the book in your local Waterstones. In fact, it will be a whole chapter shorter, as Harris has joined the growing number of authors to have produced extra material for the use of the bricks and mortar bookshop only.\n\nWaterstones (as perhaps should be expected from its largest chain of bookshops) has led the way in bookshop-exclusive extra material. Its edition of Ian Rankin’s Standing in Another Man’s Grave includes an essay on Rebus by Rankin, The Hydrangea Sonata by Ian M Banks, has an author interview and a glossary of his science-fiction terms, while Stuart Macbride’s latest novel contains an extra short story. In its non-fiction department, On The Map by Simon Garfield (the chain’s bestselling non-fiction book of last year) comes with a free pull out map, and The John Lennon Letters prints letters unpublished elsewhere. Waterstones is not alone in selling customised editions of books. The small independent bookseller Foyles has had great success with similar initiatives, such as retailing copies of Alexander McCall Smith’s novel Trains and Lovers with the added bonus of a small booklet containing the brand appropriate exclusive short story ‘All Change at St Pancras’ (one of Foyles’s six branches is located in London’s St. Pancras Station).\n\nWaterstones PR manager Jon Howells links this emergent trend to the fight back of the bricks and mortar bookshop against the joint cyber threat of Amazon and e-books, ‘the more we can…. make people shop on in a high street bookshop the better.’ And it is easy to dismiss bespoke books as just one marketing ploy among many. But in doing so, you would be mistaking it for something akin to a free eye shadow on a copy of Vogue. The fact is that, by marketing the printed book as an enriched counterpoint to the homogenous functionality of the e-book, we are witnessing the beginnings of a shift in the very values we assign to the printed book.\n\nIf one ever needed a reminder that the literary text is a much a product of material circumstance as authorial imagination, this is it. As yet, the extra material has been confined very much to the text’s margins. What makes Peaches especially worth commentary is the way in which the extra material begins to encroach upon the main body of the story. According to Harris, the extra-material can be read as an ‘an epilogue or even as the prologue to an as-yet-unwritten story.’ Will the readers of the Waterstones’ editions come away with a rather different view of her novel from those who have bought it from Amazon? Is the next step to have shop-exclusive variables in the story? Will the text revert to being as unstable and multi-various as that of a Shakespearean play? How long will it be before book groups are discussing the rival merits of the Waterstones’ version of the latest novel as opposed to the Blackwells’ one?\n\nThe printed book, therefore, begins to be coded not as something uniform or production line but as almost artisanal—like spelt bread from a local baker as opposed to Hovis sliced white. And because of this, it is changing from the often-unconsidered vehicle for a text to an artefact in and of itself—something reflected not merely in the content of the book but in its physical form. No more the cheap, mass production values of the Wordsworth Classics with their slapdash editing and thin yellow pages. These days, books are made to grace shelves rather than merely be stored on them. In his 2011 Booker Prize acceptance speech, Julian Barnes declared his belief that the endurance of the printed book will be contingent on high-end production values:  “Those of you who have seen my book, whatever you think of its contents, will probably agree it is a beautiful object. And if the physical book, as we’ve come to call it, is to resist the challenge of the e-book, it has to look like something worth buying, worth keeping.”\n\nBarnes’s sentiments find an echo in Alexander McCall Smith, a great champion of the bookshop and printed book alike. He cites the Everyman series as an exemplar of attractive publishing. He says he is happy to do anything he can to help promote the cause of the printed book and he is optimistic as to its fate, ‘I’m not one of those who believe that the physical book is going to disappear… the physical book is a lovely aesthetically pleasing object and people want that… As is often the case with these changes they’re quite nuanced and not necessarily a simple picture.’\n\nThe same could be said of the changes being undergone by the bricks and mortar bookshops themselves. Over the last couple of months, Foyles has held a series of workshops (some open, some for industry professionals) on the subject of the independent bookshop of the future. Ideas discussed have ranged from the installation of Yo-Sushi-style bookbars and 24\/7 book dispensers on walls outside shops, to author-curated displays, membership schemes, and writing rooms. Meanwhile, new Managing Director James Daunt is attempting to make Waterstones seem more like an independent bookshop. Its shops routinely play host to local societies, its cafes carry stock from local suppliers and books of local interest are flagged in displays. If the book is becoming more like an artwork, then the bookshop looks set to become more like a theatre—or at least a type of cultural hub. The twenty-first-century equivalent to the eighteenth-century coffee shop, perhaps?\n\nTechnological innovation can have a nasty habit of killing off what came before. The fate of HMV (itself a former owner of Waterstones) provides a recent lesson on the destructiveness of evolutionary technology. Yet there have been different models of change—television has not switched off the radio, cinema has not meant a curtain down for theatre, and in spite of cameras, painting is still very much in the frame. These art forms might have been made more niche, more elitist, but still they survive. Posher, prettier, pricier, even perhaps more political (a preference for a printed book purchased from a high street bookshop could just as easily be read as a rejection of faceless, corporate globalised internet behemoths as a fondness for paper)—is that the future of the printed book? Watch your bookshelves carefully—the physical book is shaking the dust from its covers and gingerly flexing its creaking spine. As it starts to make its way from the place it has held in popular understanding since the invention of the steam press, the question is where will it come to rest?\n\n———–\n\nWritten under a Creative Commons License: with edits: https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/1.0\/###"}
{"prompt":"What is the significance of David Bowie's work?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, the Thin White Duke, The Man Who Fell to Earth, the man of seemingly endless identity changes. David Bowie has been all of these, and more. So an exhibition which purports to tell us about him faces a challenge of monstrous proportions. Does it deliver the goods on this rock god?\n\nWhat is on offer here, and how has it been assembled? With the aid of unprecedented access to the David Bowie Archive, Victoria Broakes and Geoffrey Marsh—the V & A’s Theatre and Performance curators—have assembled more than 300 objects that have been brought together for the very ﬁrst time. As we enter the exhibition, we are greeted by the striped bodysuit designed by Kansai Yamamoto for Bowie’s Aladdin Sane tour of 1973, which raises our expectations for a feast of ﬂamboyance to follow. But, to remind us of the world that Bowie (born 1947) grew up in—a world of conservative values on the cusp of social change—we see copies of the novels Absolute Beginners and Lady Chatterley’s Lover and a poster for John Osborne’s play Look Back in Anger.\n\nThen, as if we are in the bedroom of an obsessive yet orderly Bowie fan, we are off on a voyage of exploration around the different aspects of Bowie’s constantly-changing self-presentation,  something which is emphasized by the use of the word “is”—with its connotations of living, moving, and having being—in the exhibition’s title. The effect of rooms of costumes, ﬁlm-clips, records, and notes for song lyrics is overwhelming, so let us pinpoint some examples which mark his development. We see photographs of his early musical years in which he seems a pensive, moody Mod but with a hint of expectation, as if he is telling us to keep an eye out for him as better things are coming. And, indeed, a more exotic mode of presentation awaited Bowie. This was the era of alternative performance art, of varied content, and varying competence. Dancer, actor, and mime artist Lindsay Kemp used Bowie’s music in his show, and a photograph shows the performer simpering deceptively. From Kemp, Bowie learnt stagecraft, including the use of costume, lighting, and sets, skills which he would proﬁtably put to use in his own performances. There is a copy of a programme for Bowie’s 1969 Changes tour and an original record of his single ‘Space 0ddity’ from the same year, the track that would bring him his first taste of mainstream success.\n\nBowie owed his fame, arguably, more to his visual style than his music. His ﬁrst job after leaving school was working in advertising and, while it is easy to snipe at the morals and workings of that profession, it is one that requires mental and visual skills for its practitioners. Bowie built on that early experience, and we see his developing sense of visual importance in a photo taken of him in 1973 by photographer Mick Rock where, even though he is not directly facing the camera, his smile, although meant to be natural-looking, has an element of a pose about it. Bowie was developing in other ways, too. We see a programme for Andy Warhol’s underground play Pork, held at the Roundhouse in 1971 and the members of whose cast—including transgendered singer Wayne (later Jayne) County, and gay actor Tony Zanetta—were befriended by Bowie, giving him the idea for chronicling the lifestyles of people on society’s socio-sexual margins. This is a reminder of the way in which the seventies was a period in which dystopia, violence, and other noir themes were explored in a way that, arguably, would be almost unimaginable today for reasons of social and ﬁnancial risk aversion (would ﬁlms from that decade such as Chinatown, A Clockwork Orange, and The French Connection get the go-ahead today?). Bowie’s continuing attention to appearance and performance are emphasized by a smart black suit designed by Ola Hudson for the character of Thomas Jerome Newton and who was played by Bowie in Nicholas Roeg’s science-ﬁction ﬁlm of 1976, The Man Who Fell to Earth. (This is complemented by a poster for the ﬁlm showing Bowie with a tough yet ethereal look.) We also see Bowie’s Pierrot or ‘Blue Clown’ costume, designed by Natasha Komiloff, for his ‘Ashes to Ashes’ video of 1980 (possibly the best promo video for the then-burgeoning New Romantic movement). We see artwork for the sleeve of Bowie’s 1974 album Diamond Dogs, where Bowie adopts a tough yet effeminate dog-like—or should that be bitch-like?—pose, and a model for a jagged stage set for his Glass Spider tour of 1987.\n\nHowever, this exhibition raises several questions, the ﬁrst two of which are interrelated and might, in some quarters, be regarded as almost blasphemous to utter: how original is Bowie, and was the Bowie phenomenon of 40 years ago genuinely revelatory? In the seventies, if you considered that rock music had a primarily socio-political function—or if you were gay and ambitious, but lived in atmosphere where disapproval of homosexuality was combined with low expectations of life in general—then you probably did feel that Bowie’s performance style was a visual, and sexual, epiphany (the exhibition features the multi-coloured suit worn by Bowie for his performance of ‘Starman‘ on Top of the Pops in July 1972, an event which manifested his powerful effeminacy in all its glory).\n\nIf, however, you were familiar with the camp antics of the Bright Young People of the 1920s—such as Stephen Tennant—or felt that rock’s prime function was to entertain, preferably in as preposterous, over-the-top manner as possible, then you probably did not. Instead, you regarded Bowie’s contribution to it as excellent theatre, with the added value that—if you were so minded—being a fan of it would give you the satisfaction of annoying parents and other authority ﬁgures. Views will—to put it mildly—vary on these issues. But what cannot be doubted is that Bowie’s work did help to set a new benchmark for rock performance which would, in turn, have a societal impact in other ways.\n\nThe Gay Liberation movement emerging in America in the early 1970s had a puritanical streak in it which rejected ﬂamboyance (arguably, in the case of gay men, because of sexual guilt, against which the clone cult of hyper masculinity could act as an antidote) and which would spread across the Atlantic, but effeminate gays could ﬁnd a home among Bowie fans and helped to bring out alternative sexualities as a matter for public comment. And he showed that ordinary kids could become art objects. The largely working-class New Romantics who, dumb with mascara and blind with lipstick, would parade a few years later around Soho were indebted to Bowie’s example and inﬂuence. But as they did so—and built their careers in the process—they also promoted gender equality, for New Romanticism was a movement where women took leading roles as designers, musicians, and club ﬁgures. Those career-building boys and girls would also keep alive—and pass-on—the ﬂame of Bowie’s stage presence and style presentation, with stars such as Lady Gaga acting as its current torchbearers.\n\nThe exhibition prompts further questions. How many Bowie enthusiasts plan to visit this exhibition (for which 47,000 tickets have been sold so far), not only in recognition of his artistic gifts but also because he represents an era when sexualities which are today considered mainstream were regarded as having a frisson of delightfully dangerous deviancy, and pop\/rock music, which is now formulaic—‘I’m living my dream’ has become an almost obligatory phrase within the TV pop talent show liturgy—was considered genuinely rebellious (although it can argued that it lost the r-word when The Beatles were given an award by Harold Wilson as a way for him to cash-in on youth culture)? And is enthusiasm for Bowie a subconscious way of seeking solace through artistic and sexual ﬂamboyance in a time of socio-political insecurity? For during what were arguably Bowie’s golden years, Britain was in the grip of economic, industrial, and racial tensions and uncertainties which seem to resonate today with the credit crunch, mass unemployment, gang violence, concerns (now being taken-up by mainstream politicians) over immigration, with disquiet over Muslim inﬂuence thrown in. It is no surprise to feel that Bowie—via a combination of nostalgia and newness—may be reprising his role in a societal situation which is less than hunky dory.\n\nBut back to the exhibition. ‘In a series of photographs at its final section, Bowie is shown in a photo taken for his Pin Ups album by Mick Rock in 1973’. But there is another photograph of Bowie, taken this year by Jimmy King, showing the singer sitting in front of a joint photograph of Bowie and legendary Beat writer William Burroughs. In both pictures Bowie — despite the time lapse — radiates vulnerability and expectation, arguably two basic qualities to be found within any practitioner of the arts. This exhibition is a celebration, not only of Bowie’s magpie mind in spotting artistic and cultural trends, but also of his eagle eye in seeing how to present them in a way that continues to inspire today’s observers of his output to explore fresh cultural paths.\n\n—————\n\nWritten with a Creative Commons License, with edits: https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/1.0\/###"}
{"prompt":"What are the influences behind physical design?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When we look at a product of physical design—a building, say—we do not usually think about the influences which went into its production. Subconsciously, we know that they are there, of course, but we tend to concentrate on the finished product as if it is something which has sprung, fully-formed, from the mind of its creator. This exhibition makes us think about the influences behind physical design—in this case fashion—and does so with material from what is still regarded in some quarters as a tricky decade.\n\nPrimarily under examination here are some of the fashions which emerged from the flamboyant New Romantic clubbing period which dominated the 1980s. This is a controversial era to cover for reasons we will examine later. There is also material from the Rave scene which followed it. But first, let us look at some of the high points of what is on offer here from a time when posing was top of the night-life agenda.\n\nVivienne Westwood’s designs take pride of place with the trousers, jacket, and red-and-gold bicorn hat from her 1981-82 ‘Pirates’ collection, the hobble skirt and baggy top from her 1983-84 ‘Witches’ collection and the curvy shortness of her 1985 cotton mini-crini, an item at once conservative yet explicit, combining a traditional form of skirt designed to conceal the lower shape of the female body with a modern style which reveals it.\n\nIn the dark, club-like setting of the exhibition, our attention is caught by a homburg-style hat with a turned-up brim by Stephen Jones from 1981. From 1983, Sarah Whitworth gives us a Goth ensemble of skirt, blouse, corset, and jacket decorated with a spider’s-web-like pattern. By way of contrast, we get a taste of 1930s glamour with, from 1986, a long stretch frock by Georgina Godley. From 1989, Pam Hogg gives us a gold bondage-style outfit and, from the following year, a multi-coloured catsuit, reminding us of the period when her Newburgh Street shop offered an inspiring contrast to the then-prevailing tourist tat trap of nearby Carnaby Street. And, also from 1990, we have Rifat Ozbek’s sparkling silver jacket showing that the glitz of New Romantic clubbing was still able to keep its head above the energetic but mundane waters of Rave culture.\n\nIn order to enter the mood of the milieu from which these fashions emerged, there is a darkened room where video footage of nightclubs from the era, such as Taboo (so called because as its host, designer, and performance artist Leigh Bowery, said, ‘there is nothing you can’t do there’,) and music from the time, are streamed by veteran New Romantic DJ Jeffrey Hinton. This will bring back happy memories for any (now middle-aged) New Romantic visitors, and it gives some idea of the self-generating energy of the club scene. Its showy self-confidence may come as a revelation to younger clubbers used to a more informal night-life ethos. When out clubbing in that era, the attitude was to demonstrate, and expect, the visually unexpected. Style magazines such as Blitz, i-D and The Face were constantly keeping their readers on tenterhooks for what might be the next style development to appear. But the exhibition could, arguably, do more to exemplify and expand upon the influences behind the styles and which went into the melting-pot of this scene.\n\nMost New Romantics had been at the artier spectrum of Punk (which, it should be remembered, was about the standard youthful pastimes of baiting of authority figures and having sex-and-alcohol-fuelled fun, rather than a serious political statement or movement), itself formed by a magpie-like gathering from previous youth styles. There were other influences, too. In the early seventies, there had been Glam Rock, with Bryan Ferry showing how a person could reinvent themselves through style, and David Bowie who showed that someone from a working-class background could become a star(man). (Any visitor to this exhibition should try, if possible, to catch the Bowie one at the V&A too,) Also, the film Cabaret, and the biographical television play The Naked Civil Servant about Quentin Crisp, had prepared the way for open avowals of homosexuality and bisexuality.###"}
{"prompt":"How does Paul Klee's work explore the relationship between imagination and reality?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Imagination and precision are two attributes that we might think are in conflict, with the former being a product of freedom and the latter a matter of fact-based exactitude. But must they be perpetually at loggerheads? Can the seemingly fey lead to a clearer apprehension and comprehension of deeper, and possibly permanent, realities? An exhibition of works by Paul Klee—the UK’s first major show of his art for over a decade—gives us a chance to consider these questions.\n\nBorn in Switzerland in 1879, Klee started out as a musician, but decided to become a painter instead and, after a period of training in Munich followed by a visit to Italy, returned to his homeland early in the last century and began etching before going to Germany, where he launched himself into a successful career spanning the years between 1906 and 1933. He was involved with the Expressionist Blaue Reiter (Blue Rider) group, which included Kandinsky and Marc (the group’s name originated from both artists having a mutual liking for blue, whilst Kandinsky liked riders, and Marc horses) which was, arguably, the most important modern art movement in pre-Great War Germany. Klee would—after the end of the war—go on to teach at the Bauhaus in Weimar and Dessau, followed by a period at Dusseldorf Academy. Now, with an exhibition building on new research, and containing paintings, drawings and watercolours from collections around the world reunited and displayed in a way originally intended by their creator, we have a fresh chance to examine Klee’s work. Which works best give us an idea of what he was trying to achieve?\n\nKlee defined his work of free fantasy as ‘taking a line for a walk’. But what Klee had in mind here was a series of imaginative strolls. In ‘Flower Bed’ (1913) we get an explosion of browns and reds and greens, whilst ‘Friendly Place’ (1919) appears to be a bustling cafe full of human interaction. ‘City Between Realms’ (1921) gives us a series of Heath Robinson-like hanging shapes. ‘Comedy’ (1921) appears as anything but—it strikes an ironically disturbing note with a series of cartoon-like figures radiating fear, confusion, and up-for-it sexuality. ‘Analysis of Diverse Perversities’ (1922) shows a figure with a telescope along with a bird among machines. ‘Fish Magic’ (1925) gives us fish which, although they are in dark water, still stand out clearly in view. With Valpurgis Night’ (1935) we have sinister, jagged, yet flowing witch-like figures with pointy countenances looming up against a night sky. In ‘Park near Lu” (1938) the depiction of this place appears mysterious: it can either be taken as a riot of bushes and branches, or as map-like, showing its layout of paths and trees.\n\nBut—as the varied and sometimes disturbing contents of this selection hints—there was more to Klee’s work than met the eye. He did not simply want to be some kind of amusing illustrator. Rather, he envisaged his work to be a reflection of transcendence and we can see him almost striving to get beyond the outward and visible to the inward—the essence of existence—in his ‘Static-Dynamic Gradation’ (1923) and ‘Steps’ (1929). The former shows different coloured oblongs, as if radiating from a single centre, whilst the latter shows similar shapes but in ordered rows. It is as if he is clawing his way, on his knees and with bare hands, down to buried treasure; the inner core of existence. During his time at the Bauhaus, Klee wrote a book, The Thinking Eye, in which he put forward his theory of visual equivalents for spiritual states. Indeed, some of his work resembles a combination of paintings and symbols, a sort of fusion of visual art with writing so, in ‘Greeting’ (1922), we see how he uses red and blue arrows facing each other to suggest the act of meeting.\n\nHe may have had a single vision, but he combined different sources to achieve it. He sometimes wanted to express concepts in an almost mathematical way. And in trying to achieve this, he used not only the natural world but also music. He attempted to use visual forms to illustrate music, believing that his favourite musical form—eighteenth-century counterpoint—could be depicted by gradations of colour and value. Klee also valued the art of children and the purity of their expression, which he felt it reflected (although it might be argued that, with children’s art, directness and immaturity can go hand in hand, making it a potentially detrimental form of depiction for its adult users and admirers alike).\n\nBut whilst Klee and his associates were triumphing in the art scene, the Nazis were winning the battle of the streets. In 1933, when Hitler came to power, Klee was dismissed from his teaching post by them and then left for his homeland. They regarded his output as ‘degenerate art’, removing some 102 of his works from German galleries. Klee, meanwhile, became even more prolific, despite the twin burdens of flight from the productive venue where he had spent most of his working life, combined with bad health. He died in 1940.\n\nOn one level, it is easy to see why the Nazis judged Klee’s work as they did. He was influenced by Blake, Beardsley, Ensor, and Goya. In other words, his work was a risky mixture of the mystical, the decadently camp, the macabre, and the harshly realistic. Either disaster or genius could emerge from such a combination of influences: the outcome would be the latter.\n\nToday his work can appear fanciful, but it is clear why it appeared decadent to those whose taste was governed by fearful philistinism afraid of anything which, however whimsical, might appear as some sort of serious challenge to the concept of order: there is, in what we see here, a positive exuberance combined with an individualistic sense of the visionary which combine to challenge the mass conformity of the party—any party. (The same can be said about Surrealism, with its attempts to depict the disturbing content of the sub-conscious.) But it can be said that—whether they realised it or not—the real threat to the Nazis was not from Klee’s whimsicality: it was from the way his work, with its search for essences, suggested that there were truths which were deeper than the simplistic blood and soil beliefs of Nazism. (In connection with Klee’s search for deeper realities, with their implication of order which could be examined—and so evaluated and tabulated—it is both interesting and relevant to note that he inscribed numbers on his works with in accordance with a personal cataloguing system: one wonders how many agents and gallery-owners would wish that their clients followed suit today.)\n\nKlee’s work in this exhibition can be said to show the power of the playful. But it also shows the threat of the radical, especially when it is expressed with playfulness. And it has relevance for us today as it has the possibility of a serious application given the current never-ending cascade of signs and symbols with which we are confronted and have to evaluate. Klee gives clues about how they can be positively mastered to show the hidden meanings to which they may point.\n\n———-\n\nWritten under a Creative Commons Licence, with some edits: https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/1.0\/###"}
{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of occupational burnout?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Finding a dream job—with comfortable work conditions and a high salary—is probably a goal everyone strives for. Indeed, in western society, where having a job is an important part of a successful person’s image, it is crucial that work brings satisfaction. However, it is not rare that even the best job starts to weigh down on a person. Most frequently, it happens to people who spend several years performing the same duties, although the period between getting hired and beginning to feel overwhelmed by the job differs from person to person. This is a problem so common and so significant that it has begun to be studied by psychologists, human resources specialists, and other experts; there is also a special term for it: occupational burnout—and although people who have it often tend to not take it seriously (believing they should “focus,” “pull themselves together,” beat their laziness,” or “get more motivated”), it is in fact a dangerous condition which requires taking adequate measures.\n\nFirst of all, job burnout does not just happen: it is a gradual process of work stress building up to the point when it becomes overwhelming and unmanageable. In brief, it can be described as physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion, combined with the feeling of hopelessness and feeling a dead-end in the matters connected to one’s professional duties (Study.com). In this regard, it is rather close to depression—except that burnout starts with and is mostly connected to one’s professional activity.\n\nThis condition greatly decreases the quality of a person’s life, so the earlier it is detected, the better for one’s psychological health. So, what are the symptoms of occupational burnout?\n\nPhysical symptoms usually start with fatigue. A person feels that he or she is too tired to even get up and go to work; the amount of work such person can do per day lowers, and if no measures are taken, such fatigue can turn into exhaustion, when one’s energy resources are completely depleted. Insomnia often accompanies fatigue; although it might seem illogical, being unable to sleep when feeling tired of one’s job (or having other sleep deprivations such as nightmares, restless sleep, early awakenings, or superficial sleep) are common for occupational burnout. Other common symptoms include the loss of appetite (or, in some cases, bulimia), increased illness, and various pains and constraints in the body: chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting, headaches, and so on (Psychology Today).\n\nMental exhaustion symptoms often include constant doubts in one’s competence. Even the simplest tasks start to seem difficult to accomplish, which leads to decreased initiative and a drop in productivity. A sense of failure and\/or wasting one’s time on activities which completely do not matter is another common symptom; a person with burnout stops caring about results and the significance of what they do, work duties start to feel like a waste of time and energy, and there is nothing that can bring satisfaction to such person at work. The lack of the sense of accomplishment is yet another symptom which undermines a burned out person’s psychological well-being; as a result, one can develop anhedonia—the inability or a decreased ability to feel joy—in particular, about work done (HelpGuide.org).\n\nEmotional symptoms may vary from anger to anxiety—and rather often, they manifest themselves simultaneously. At first, a person getting close to burnout might feel that he or she is pressed on, or that they are not valued at work; later, such a person develops edginess, irritability, a lack of self-esteem in work matters, and may end up with feeling fear, dread, and disgust towards their professional duties (Psychology Today).\n\nAs it has been mentioned, occupational burnout does not occur overnight. It is a gradual process, which usually unfolds in four stages, each of which includes the aforementioned symptoms. Usually, it begins with physical and emotional fatigue; through the period of shame and doubts, a person burning out gets cynical and callous—this is the stage when one’s professional and personal relationships can suffer the most; after this stage, a burnout will most likely transform into full-scale depression, when a person will need serious psychiatric help (Stressdoc.com).\n\nSo what causes this condition? The reasons are rather numerous. One of the most common cases is when a job does not match a person’s skills and\/or interests. If you always dreamed to be an artist, but instead have to drive a truck, your frustration about this fact is a serious factor which might lead to burnout in the future. Dysfunctional workplace dynamics, when one has to work in bad conditions or a toxic environment builds up stress and serves as another cause of a burnout. Extreme work loads, the lack of balance between professional and personal life, the inability to influence decisions that affect one’s job—all this can also serve as significant factors in developing the discussed dangerous condition (Mayo Clinic).\n\nThere is good news: the signs of occupational burnout can be noticed rather early. If you are feeling that every new day is a bad day (your hatred towards Mondays counts as well), if you stopped caring or care less about your professional duties and the quality of the work done, if you feel tired more than usual during a relatively long period of time, if the tasks you perform start to feel mind-numbing or meaningless, or if you feel you are not valued and\/or appreciated, then you might be on the road to a burnout (Helpguide.org).\n\nWhat can be done about it? Mostly, one can prevent burnout or decrease its symptoms by building more constructive and fulfilling relationships with people one works with, re-organizing one’s work environment (for example, cleaning one’s desk, working from home or in cooperative spaces), and reframing one’s outlook and priorities. If you feel like you are going to burn out, you might want to take a break, sleep more, spend more time with friends and in nature, exercise more (physical activity, especially swimming, is a natural antidote to stress and depression)—and, in difficult situations, change your job and visit a psychotherapist. Reducing the amount of consumed caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol is also recommended; the latter is especially dangerous: although many people believe alcohol to be a sort of an antidepressant, in fact it inhibits one’s neural system and only worsens one’s psychological condition (HelpGuide.org).\n\nAs it can be seen, occupational burnout is not a problem one should take lightly. It is a severe psychological condition which involves physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion, and which can lead to depression. People working in bad conditions and\/or toxic work environments, doing a job they dislike, or feeling a lack of control over their careers are likely to develop a burnout sooner or later. Fortunately, this condition can be prevented and treated, so if you notice yourself developing some of the symptoms of an occupational burnout, do not hesitate to take appropriate measures.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some common psychological defense mechanisms?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The human psyche is a powerful, and at the same time, delicate tool of perception and cognition. From the first days of life and until death, the psyche constantly develops, changes, and adapts to one’s environment. Such flexibility guarantees that a human being’s personality persists no matter what; this comes at a cost, though: in order to defend itself, the psyche launches a set of defensive mechanisms. Roughly speaking, a defense mechanism is a way of perception and thinking (involving subconscious processes) which ensures that feelings, thoughts, and experiences unpleasant to a person remain unperceived. Although these mechanisms are useful in stressful and\/or dangerous situations, rather often they obstruct normal, fluent interactions between a person and reality.\n\nDefense mechanisms are numerous, and each person has a set of their own. However, some of them are more or less common for many people. These mechanisms are rationalization, repression, reaction formation, denial, projection, and regression.\n\nRepression is probably the most basic and the most widespread psychological defense mechanism, underlying all the others. If described shortly, repression means keeping frustrating, threatening, or depressive thoughts and feelings in the unconsciousness. The most common example of repression is when a person goes through an extremely traumatizing experience in childhood—molestation, rape, violence, and so on on—and his\/her psyche completely banishes the memories about these events from his or her consciousness; a person seemingly forgets about what happened to him or her. However, sooner or later, these memories and feelings start to resurface; this is inevitable—one cannot keep these memories repressed forever. The trick here is that these memories can sometimes be partially wrong or totally false, which makes them unreliable. The human psyche is complicated, and a resurfaced memory can be a “ciphered” message about something else, so each of them should be taken with reasonable skepticism (Listverse). First discovered by Sigmund Freud, repression preserves a person’s ego from guilt, fear, disturbing wishes, and other unpleasant sensations. The problem is that even being concealed, they still create anxiety, making a person’s life more difficult (Simply Psychology). Therefore, repression is a defense mechanism that comes at a high cost.\n\nRationalization is another common defense mechanism; a person using it distorts perceived facts in such a way that they appear less threatening. For example, someone struggling with anxiety could try to rationalize it by explaining it with fatigue, stress, the lack of sleep, and so on. This is an example of conscious rationalization, though; for many people, this defense mechanism becomes automatic, so they start rationalizing everything, unconsciously making excuses on every occasion, believing their own lies (Simply Psychology).\n\nYet another defense mechanism slightly resembles repression: denial. It is a rather simple mechanism that develops in early childhood as one of the possible reactions to unpleasant events. Denial is one’s refusal to accept reality, preferring to act in a way that something has never happened. Little children sometimes close their eyes with their palms when something unpleasant is going on around them, and in the context of psychology, denial is rather similar to such behavior. The most common example of denial is a person suffering from substance abuse, refusing to admit that he or she has an addiction problem (PsychCentral). Another example is a woman involved in an abusive relationship who tries to justify her spouse’s violent behavior, or refuses to admit that he does harm to her.\n\nA rather tricky mechanism is projection; in its basis lies a misattribution, when a person possessing unwanted feelings, desires, or thoughts. Instead of admitting and accepting them, he or she projects them on another person who might not have them. The simplest example is a married couple having an argument, when a husband blames his wife of not listening to him, when in fact it is he who does not want to listen to what his wife has to say. A more complicated case is when a person denies certain (even positive) qualities in himself\/herself, and instead attributes other people with these qualities. Rather often, projection occurs when one is not able or ready to accept their own motivations and emotions (Listverse).\n\nAnother important defense mechanism is regression. When frightened or stressed, a person may suddenly start behaving in a childish manner: for example, start giggling uncontrollably when getting acquainted with a person of the opposite sex, or become capricious when not being able to get something desired. In other words, regression means returning to more primitive or childish forms of behavior when facing difficult situations (Simply Psychology).\n\nAll of these mechanisms are not necessarily harmful; they are useful and necessary at some stages of one’s life, protecting the psyche from the challenges a person cannot yet overcome. Besides, when used consciously, these mechanisms can be helpful: projection helps us to make plans and organize our lives (by “projecting” ourselves into the future); repression and denial may be useful in some cases when there is a need to act despite harsh circumstances. However, many of these mechanisms tend to become subconscious and automatic; from this perspective, they can definitely decrease the quality of a person’s life; comparing the human mind to an operating system, defense mechanisms act like programs constantly in the background: a user cannot see them, but they drain system resources uncontrollably if not turned off in time. This is why it is important to detect and understand one’s own mechanisms of psychological defense, and get rid of those of them that have become useless.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the most popular urban legends?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Many of us have at least once heard ancient legends about gods, fairies, giants, the creation of the world, the apocalypse, Ragnarok, and other similar stories. Originating from the times when people had no scientific methods of scrutinizing and comprehending the world around them, these myths and legends served as a way of explaining the mysterious phenomena (for the mind of an ancient person) surrounding them. What is lightning if not the manifestation of Zeus’ wrath? What is a rainbow if not a bridge to Asgard? How could all the diversity of nature appear if not created by the gods? Rather primitive in the beginning, these legends displayed the fear of an ancient individual in front of the unknown, and helped them cajole the forces of nature by worship, praying, and making sacrifices.\n\nAs societies developed, so did science, and gradually there were no more mysteries for an average person to be afraid of. Of course, scientists still do not know much about the Universe in view of its expanse, but for a regular Earth dweller, the world with its natural manifestations is no longer enigmatic. However, the fear of the unknown still remains; it has transformed, changed its form, and instead of fearing thunderstorms and darkness, people have created new fears: zombies, aliens, ghosts, and so on. Some of these fears are powerful enough to have become the new myths and legends of the modern technocratic age; instead of nature, they are now connected to urban environments, and reflect the deepest parts of modern people’s minds.\n\nPerhaps the most famous urban legends are connected to alien abductions; there have been countless movies, books, documentaries, and stories dedicated to this subject, but probably one of the most credible and shocking is the story of Pier Zanfretta’s abduction by aliens; in fact, it is so realistic that it can hardly be called a legend. This man claimed to have been captured by aliens, and the descriptions he provided both in his clear thinking and under hypnosis are fascinatingly detailed and non-controversial. Zanfretta was a police officer on patrol in the Italian town of Torriglia. During the patrol, his car stopped dead; at the same time, he saw four strange lights in the garden behind the house, near where his car stopped. Thinking that it might be a crime in progress, Zanfretta rushed to the garden, when suddenly he felt a touch from behind; when the police officer turned his head, he saw “an enormous green, ugly, and frightful creature, with undulating skin, no less than ten feet tall.” Then the officer saw a triangular vessel taking off, and felt intense heat. He tried to reach the dispatcher via his radio, but the communication was almost immediately disrupted. A patrol group arrived an hour later; they found Zanfretta lying on the ground, with his clothes strangely warm (it was a cold December night outside); after waking up, Zanfretta could not recognize his colleagues, and did not seem to realize what was going on around him for a while. Later, he was questioned by the authorities, and hypnotized by Dr. Mauro Moretti (the video of this hypnosis session can be easily found on YouTube)—in both cases Zanfretta’s testimonies were detailed, logical, and non-controversial. So far, this case is considered to be one of the most credible and reliable in modern ufology (abovetopsecret.com).\n\nAnother urban legend that has become extremely popular throughout the recent decade is Slenderman—a tall, haggard man-like silhouette with disproportionately long arms and legs, who haunts and kills (or cripples) his victims. Slenderman is able to hide in plain sight, and once you notice him, with each glimpse in his direction, he will appear closer. Slenderman prefers to stalk wooded areas, because there he can easily blend in with the environment due to his proportions; when he finds a victim, he haunts them in their house, beginning to appear in dark doorways or TV screens. Slenderman mesmerizes the victim, making them walk right into his hands; according to another version of the legend, Slenderman is a sort of Sandman: he wakes a sleeping victim up and asks them a question. If answered properly, he only breaks the victim’s arms and legs; if not, the victim dies in torture. The feature regarding arms and legs probably refers to Slenderman’s own story: it is said that he was once a regular man, who was beaten, impaled, and had his limbs torn out of their sockets (playwithdeath.com). Regardless of the origins, Slenderman is probably one of the creepiest and the most popular urban legends nowadays.\n\nThe two stories above refer mostly to western culture. However, if we take a look at the East—Asia, in particular—we will find an enormous amount of authentic and frightening stories. For example, in Japan there is a legend of the so-called Kuchisake Onna (“kuchi” – mouth, “sake” – slit, “onna” – woman). It is said that she was once a samurai’s wife who cheated on her husband with another man. After learning of her betrayal, the samurai cut the woman’s mouth, making it twice as large than it should be. Since that time, the woman’s spirit haunts Japan; usually, Kuchisake Onna is depicted as a woman wearing a coat and a mask; when approaching her victim, she asks: “Am I pretty?” If the victim answers positively, the woman takes off her mask and asks the same question. If the answer this time is negative, she kills her victim—or, according to other versions of the story, cuts their mouth with a knife (Listverse.com).\n\nUrban legends are much more numerous than those listed above. However, these are probably the most popular, widespread, and scary. Stories about being abducted by aliens are frightening, because knowing the size of the Universe, one can never be sure that aliens do not exist, or that their intentions are non-hostile; Slenderman is an example of a creepy wraith who dwells in big cities and surrounding forests, and perhaps a perfect embodiment of the unspoken fears that layer in our collective subconsciousness; as for Kuchisake Onna, she is an exotic Asian ghost, perhaps not too scary for westerners, but definitely frightening for Japanese people. Urban legends are likely to persist for centuries—unless all of the world’s mysteries are solved, and there is left nothing to be afraid of anymore.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the reasons people might be afraid of success?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Perhaps everyone is familiar with the fear of failure: a paralyzing sensation of a probable setback preventing a person from accomplishments, broadening one’s zone of comfort, trying out something new, self-expression, and so on. Indeed, the fear of failure can greatly affect a person’s life, so even a gifted and skilled man or woman who could have reached success due to his or her talents prefers to stay passive to avoid potential failures. However, this is not the only obstacle one can face; there is also another fear, which for many people might seem paradoxical, but which, nevertheless, is an effective and sometimes unbearable barricade on one’s way to accomplishments: the fear of success.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem absurd; the fear of success is something a person in the modern success-oriented society can hardly confess to other people. Still, it remains a great problem for thousands of people all over the world. A talented writer having written several brilliant novels, hesitating to send them to a publishing house; an office worker who could greatly improve the productivity of his\/her department, afraid to step up and submit his\/her propositions on reorganization; a scientist bearing a revolutionary theory contradicting deep-seated conceptions, but does not expose them; a person having found a dream job, but afraid to send his or her CV. These are just some examples of the fear of success.\n\nBut what causes this fear? Why would someone be so afraid of reaching their dreams so badly that it would prevent them from even trying to do it? Psychologists suggest several possible reasons for this.\n\nSusanne Babbel, a psychologist specializing in trauma and the post traumatic stress disorder, believes that the fear of success might have something in common with the fear of excitement and arousal, including sexual sensations. People who suffered from traumatic experiences in the past, or are struggling with PTSD currently, might confuse the excitement of success with the excitement or arousal experienced during traumatic events (since excitement is not necessarily a “positive” feeling—it can occur not only while anticipating for something pleasant to happen, but also in situations of danger). For example, if excitement or arousal was experienced in relation to sexual trauma, the excitement of being close to achieving success might, in certain cases, be confused with the sensations connected to the trauma, and thus become undesired and feared; although, this is not always the case. In other words, people who have undergone traumatic events can associate the feeling of success with the feeling of trauma, and in order to avoid exposing themselves to danger, they prefer to abstain themselves from accomplishing their goals, or achieving success otherwise (Psychology Today).\n\nSuccess has a more complicated nature than failure, and is connected to great uncertainty. Failure is more “familiar,” so to say; success, on the other hand, may involve enormous potential changes in one’s lifestyle, behavior, connections, and so on. Therefore, for some people, it feels safer to stay within known territory—in the situations they have got used to; success implies becoming exposed to criticism, evaluation, envy, new demands, social pressure, expectations, public scrutiny, and so on. A person subconsciously anticipating all this may not feel prepared for this kind of challenge, so in order to feel safer, such a person prefers to not strive for success, but rather to stay where they are (99U).\n\nAnother reason underlying the fear of success might seem insignificant at first glance, but it is still a serious problem for many people, especially in religious communities. This is the fear of appearing nonspiritual, materialistic, and egoistic. Many people, not necessarily religious, live with the conviction that there is something wrong about wanting to be successful and rich; “It’s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” This Biblical quote, as well as its numerous variations (such as “rich people are dishonest\/greedy\/bad”), often being misinterpreted, serves as one of the main stop signs for many people. Success is often linked with money, and money in public consciousness is something that directly opposes spirituality, inner peace, self-development. Such expressions as “to sell-out,” “to be shallow,” “to be selfish,” “to be overly ambitious” and many others point to an opposition between being a spiritual person and being rich—as if one excludes another. Oppressed by public opinion along with one’s own convictions, a person might sometimes even consciously avoid situations where they could prove themselves, stand out somehow, just in order to appear more spiritual, more altruistic, than if they would in case of achieving success (Lifehack).\n\nIt is also important to remember about the fear of disappointment—the fear of success often goes hand-by-hand with it. Many people live under the impression that striving for success assumes having high expectations and hopes; in case if success cannot be achieved for some reason, the fear of having one’s hopes and dreams crumble may be a strong obstacle, so success becomes connected to potential disappointment; avoiding the latter, a person also avoids the former. Besides, people tend to feel they are simply not good enough for success, due to abusive feedback from their environment received in childhood (for instance, children calling each other “losers” in schools, or parents envying someone else’s success and justifying their own misfortunes with the constructions such as “honest people cannot have it”). Success, in this case, becomes something a person feels he\/she does not deserve, or should not have (Psychology Today).\n\nThe fear of success is a complicated phenomena, involving a number of smaller fears, misconceptions, and wrong convictions. A fear of success might be connected to some traumatic events that occurred to a person in the past; it can be also caused by the fear of great changes in one’s life accompanied by success. A person might think that “good people cannot be successful,” that they do not deserve success, or that being successful somehow turns them into selfish, shallow beings. All these convictions can be got rid of, so a person fearing success should not be ashamed of their feelings, and should probably visit his or her local psychotherapist for consultations, as it is an effective way of dealing with harmful and\/or dysfunctional beliefs.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the consequences of Dhaka's rapid population growth?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The world has a huge number of curious, fascinating, shocking, or otherwise impressive places to see. Gigantic megalopolises such as Tokyo or Shanghai, tropic paradises such as the Bora-Bora islands, amazingly contrasting cities such as Mexico City and Delhi—all these places are spectacular in their own ways. But there is a city on Earth that probably surpasses all other human-inhabited areas in terms of an extremely low quality of life. This city is called Dhaka, and a person who accidentally (and it is difficult to imagine that someone would travel there on purpose) comes to it will never forget what it has to offer to a visitor.\n\nIts old name is “Dacca” and it is the largest city in Bangladesh, and its capital, located in the geographic center of the country, in the delta of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers. Due to such a location, Dhaka is one of the world’s main rice and jute-growing regions, since these crops grow abundantly here. These cultures also define Dhaka’s dominant industries, which are textiles and food processing. Dhaka is famous with its vast amount of Muslim mosques (over 700 mosques and historic buildings related to Islamic culture. The city was raised in the 10th century, and for a century, it was the capital of the Bengal kingdom—during the period between years 1608 and 1704. Later, it served as a trading outpost for British, Dutch, and French traders, and in 1765 it became Great Britain’s colony. During the Bangladesh Independence war, the city was almost ruined, but reconstructed several years later, and in 1982 its name was changed from “Dacca” to “Dhaka” (Virtual Bangladesh).\n\nThe most prominent fact about Dhaka (except its pollution rates, but this will be discussed later) is the density of its population and the pace of its growth. According to the World Bank, Dhaka’s current population is over 15 million people; during a period of 15 years, between 1990 and 2005, Dhaka’s population doubled from 6 to 12 million, making it the world’s fastest growing city. During the period between 2001 and 2011, Dhaka’s urban area and nearby rural environments increased in population by 5 million people. There are little to no cities in the world that would grow as rapidly as Dhaka has; perhaps, only Karachi, Jakarta, and Shanghai can compare with this city in terms of population rise (RISE). As the United Nations Organization predicts, by 2025, Dhaka, along with such megalopolises as Mexico City, Shanghai, and New York, will host more than 20 million people; perhaps the only city that will be able to beat Dhaka in this competition is Tokyo, with more than 35 million people predicted to inhabit it in only eight years. The reasons standing behind Dhaka’s rapid sprawling are mass migration, trade, and high rates of birth. At the same time, the majority of this population lives a life that few would envy; the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies reports that at least 50% of Dhaka’s inhabitants live in slums, hand-built wherever possible: along the railways, on the river banks, and generally speaking, on every free piece of land. Urban geographer Nazrul Islam calls Dhaka “the megacity of the poor,” and estimates that the absolute majority (about 70%) of families living in Dhaka receive less than $170 per month; 40% of these families receive $80 or even less (CBS News).\n\nAlong with overpopulation, Dhaka experiences severe problems with water, air, and soil pollution. All possible categories of environment pollution indexes are “very high” in Dhaka. See for yourself. The overall pollution index is 95.91 points. Its air pollution index equals 85.80 points. Water pollution on this scale is 82.64; noise and light pollution indexes are high, equaling 75.78 points. The pollution of drinking water and its inaccessibility has remained Dhaka’s major problem for years; the index of this type of pollution is 65.54 points. Dissatisfaction with the low amount of trees and parks in the city, as well as the impossibility to spend quality time in it, cause the respective index to be estimated at “very high” as well—around 84.7 points. The city is extremely dirty (83.11 points), and the low quality of garbage disposal (81.08 points) does not contribute to the problem’s solution. At the same time, the indexes of purity and cleanliness are all located in “low” and “very low” sectors: on average, the index of overall cleanliness is around 19.6 points. As it can be seen, living in Dhaka is not only complicated due to economic reasons, but also dangerous for health due to horrible ecology.\n\nDhaka is one of the most densely populated megalopolises in the world, with perhaps the highest rates of population growth. However, this does not make Dhaka an urban paradise, or at least a place where people can live and work normally. In fact, the majority of Dhaka’s inhabitants live on less than $170 per month, in slums, and in an environment that is heavily polluted: air, soil, and water in this city are literally unusable. “The megacity of the poor,” Dhaka needs to solve its problems fast, otherwise this huge urban monster will most likely collapse in the upcoming decades.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the most required skills on the planet in 2017?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Everyone who has been looking for a job long enough knows how important it is to possess a set of diverse skills that complement each other. Employers are often looking not only for a person who can do a certain kind of job, but rather a candidate whose skills allow him or her to deal with a wide variety of concomitant tasks along with main duties. Moreover, there are skills that make some candidates more preferable to employers than others; this depends on the situation on the market, industry trends, specifics of each particular company, and so on—but still, possessing certain skills can help a person find a job relatively easily and quickly.\n\nAccording to LinkedIn career expert Catherine Fisher, the following skills are the most required skills on the planet in 2017: cloud and distributed computing; statistical analysis and data mining; web architecture and development framework; middleware and integration software; user interface design; network and information security; mobile development; data presentation; SEO\/SEM marketing; storage systems and management. This set varies depending on the country, and can be complemented with some other skills; for example, in Canada, one can add Java development, software revision control systems, and data engineering and warehousing to one’s resume. On the other side of the planet, in Singapore, one will be able to make use of public policy and international relations, corporate law and governance, and algorithm design (LinkedIn). But generally, the list is the same, and it is what employers have been looking for in 2016-2017.\n\nAs explained by Catherine Fisher, there are several reasons for this. For instance, cloud and distributed computing has for a while (2 years) remained the most demanded skill in the world, especially in such countries as the United States, Spain, Germany, France, Ireland, India, and Singapore. Cloud computing is nowadays the cutting edge of technological development, so in order to stay competitive and follow trends, companies prefer to hire people knowledgeable in this area. Close to cloud computing and distribution is data presentation. In the epoch of graphic design and information perceived visually, being able to visualize and organize data, and making it easily comprehensible, is a valuable asset for a job hunter. Connected to this skill is user interface design, since all kinds of program solutions, mobile applications, and other software widely used by companies and people around the world utilize graphic interfaces; the more intuitive, informative, and easy-to-use the interface is, the more effective the work with a piece of software becomes (LinkedIn).\n\nAccording to research conducted by Upwork, one of the largest freelance websites, the most demanded skill in 2016 was machine learning—since modern businesses generate and collect vast amounts of data, it is important to hire people able to create adaptive algorithms to manage it. Upwork’s CEO Stephane Kasriel believes the freelance workforce is the best indicator for tracing new skill trends. “Businesses are turning to freelancers to complete projects requiring skills that aren’t available locally,” Kasriel says; so, respectively, by monitoring which freelance positions are most in demand, one can make a conclusion about the most popular skills. Along with machine learning, the most required skills include social media management, Facebook marketing, and content writing. Another source, Opportunity, informs about the increased rankings of sales-related skills. Bill Jula, co-founder of Opportunity, believes that since sales are nowadays directly connected to e-commerce, customer support, and so on, and since companies need to expand and grow, the high demand on sales-related skills will persist (Business News Daily).\n\nAs it can be seen, the majority of professional skills that can make a person hired is closely connected to the sphere of Internet technologies, computing, data management, and sales. For example, cloud computing is one of the most demanded skills among employers globally; the same refers to machine learning and other similar tech skills; however, this does not mean that a person not knowledgeable in technology will not be able to find a job: Facebook marketing, content writing, social media management, and other sales-related skills have gained popularity among employers. Therefore, in order to boost one’s career, it is important to monitor these trends and obtain the most required skills.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a universal basic income?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Every day, there is news about industry automation, AI development, and mechanization. The amount of jobs previously occupied by humans is gradually decreasing due to robotics reaching new heights constantly; machines are capable of performing all kinds of duties faster and more efficiently. Even though the day when robots will take all of our jobs seems to be yet far away, the amount of professions successfully learned by robots is tremendous: from drivers to writers, and this amount is only increasing. In this regard, a simple but slightly frightening question may arise: what will human beings do when robots take all of their jobs? It is most likely that money and consumption will remain one of the main driving forces of the economy. But where will people get money if they have no more jobs? One of the probable solutions of this problem is a universal basic income.\n\nBut what exactly is it? Universal, or unconditional basic income (UBI) is a sum of money given to each member of a society or a political community by a government, without individuals having to work for it. It is not the same as a minimum income, which now exists in European countries: the key word is “unconditional,” which means that regardless of a person’s labor contribution, he or she will receive a fixed income sufficient to live and perform social functions in dignity (Basicincome-Europe.org).\n\nUBI possesses several important characteristics. As it has been mentioned, it is unconditional: even an unemployed person can receive it, by right of birth, regardless of social or financial status. It is universal, which means that every member of a society receives it, including children—from their day of birth, or after reaching a certain age; it is preferable, though, that children receive UBI from birth, since there are many countries in which they are deprived of basic needs due to existing poverty (Globalincome.org). UBI is also periodic: it is not a one-time share, but a monthly or annual supply. Finally, UBI should be granted to individuals in cash, not in the form of food or services: every individual receiving UBI should be able to decide for themselves what they want to spend money on (BIEN).\n\nThe existing conception of a welfare state implies that a person receives “free” finances only in case if he or she cannot sustain themselves. The main difference between a UBI and the existing unemployment or disability pensions is its universality; and, unlike many pensions, it should be enough to live on, not to just survive on. UBI is expected to not only increase the overall quality of life in a state, but also to decrease bureaucracy and the scales of governmental control over people’s eligibility and behavior; for this reason, this idea is rather favored by libertarians and left-wing politicians. They tend to see UBI as a way to fix a large number of problems connected to social safety, and even as a panacea from “wage slavery,” when people have to work without breaks only to sustain their basic needs. The idea of UBI is also attractive in part because they see it as a continuation of an old feminist demand for payment for housework (Independent).\n\nThere are several countries in which pilot projects of UBI have already been launched, and even though they are obviously not perfect, they have already provided positive results. For example, in Namibia, the implemented UBI project helped decrease poverty and crime rates, and school attendance among children and teenagers went up significantly. In India, those who received basic income shares used them to start their own businesses, thus proving the hypothesis that UBI can be used as a means to help poorer people “help themselves out” (Independent). As for the European Union, UBI is currently being tested as well. For example, Finland has become the first country of the EU to start paying unemployed people (who comprise 8.1% of Finnish society) certain sums of money: starting from January 1st, 2017 unemployed Finns between 25 and 58 years receive 560 euros per month for free for two years; this amount of money will be granted to them even in case if they find work. This is expected to raise unemployed people’s motivation to look for jobs, because unlike the existing social support system (which implies that even low earnings at work cause huge cuts in social payments received) UBI is paid in full regardless of a person’s income. Therefore, from now on, finding a job means an increase in monthly wages, not a decrease. The initiative is backed by the Finnish government, and is expected to solve a number of social and financial problems existing in Finland (The Guardian).\n\nAs it can be seen, a somewhat utopian idea of a universal basic income is, in fact, realistic and possible to realize. Currently, pilot tests of UBI programs have been launched in several countries around the world, including Namibia, India, and Finland, and the results they have already brought forth are encouraging. If UBI projects prove their efficiency, soon enough every person on the planet will receive unconditional, guaranteed, sufficient cash payments, and such problems as unemployment or robots taking away people’s jobs will be solved.###"}
{"prompt":"What was Ernst Haeckel's view of evolution?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This article [Ernst Haeckel and the Unity of Culture] was originally published in The Public Domain Review [https:\/\/publicdomainreview.org\/2011\/01\/24\/ernst-haeckel-and-the-unity-of-culture\/] under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0. If you wish to reuse it please see: http:\/\/publicdomainreview.org\/legal\/\n\nBy Dr. Mario A. Di Gregorio\n\nFew people were better known in the nineteenth century than the German zoologist and Darwinist Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919), yet nowadays he is known to many simply as the man who coined the phrase “ontogeny recapitulates phylogey”—the Biogenetic Law. There is much more to Haeckel than this.\n\nHaeckel studied medicine at Würzburg with Rudolf Virchow, who taught him the importance of cell theory, and at Berlin with Johannes Müller, who remained his inspiration and ideal of a teacher. His main cultural influences were Alexander von Humboldt, and, like all educated Germans, J.W. Goethe. Haeckel never wanted to be a physician but aimed for a synthesis of his interest in zoology with his artistic ability and sensibility. The decisive event for his career was the patronage and friendship he received from the anatomist and morphologist Carl Gegenbaur. This led to an appointment at the university of Jena, where he stayed all his life, and a scientific journey to southern Italy where he studied marine invertebrate zoology, in particular radiolarians, which first suggested to him a close connection between the scientific study of nature and its inner beauty.\n\nOn his return to Jena in 1860, Haeckel read the German translation of Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species. He was thoroughly won over by the book to the extent that he became the most outspoken supporter and propagandist of an evolutionary view, one which combined Lamarckian and Darwinian elements with the morphological interpretation of the aesthetic aspects of nature—thus fulfilling Goethe’s and Humboldt’s ideal of the unity of culture.\n\nIn 1866, Haeckel published his major theoretical work, Die Generelle Morphologie der Organismen (The General Morphology of Organisms). It was, however, a difficult book and seldom read. In response, he went on to publish his lectures on evolution in Natuerliche Schpfungsgeschichte (The History of Creation) which, on the other hand, in its many editions from 1868 onwards, was a great success.\n\nHaeckel’s view of evolution can be summarized as follows: at no point did God create anything, whether inorganic or organic. All is originated through an incessant progressive process leading from the simplest to the most complex—organic matter originating from inorganic matter through spontaneous generation—a process called Entwicklungsgeschichte, the “history of development.” In this process, lower living forms start from a simple cell and follow a long evolutionary path leading to higher forms. The process of life, in its increasing intricacy, can be represented best in the branching forms of the tree and Haeckel, an excellent artist, drew many beautiful such trees. In them, we find explained what he believes to be the fundamental law of natural evolution, the Biogenetic Law, that is “Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.”\n\nEvery living form travels in its embryological development (ontogeny) through stages which resemble—recapitulate, in fact—the stages through which the group to which that animal belongs itself went through in the course of its evolution (phylogeny). The gaps in the geological record of evolutionary process can be filled by hypothetical passages, and thus embryology and its foundation, cell theory, solves the evolutionary problems left unsolved by paleontology. The highest forms are nothing but lower forms, which in their history have grown to their higher position in the tree of life—a new version of Lamarck’s transformism. A worm follows an evolutionary path which takes it to higher and higher forms—man being of course the highest in its most elevated aspect, educated man. Indeed, we may conclude that a German professor is nothing but a progressed worm. Natural selection is seen by Haeckel as applicable not so much to individuals but mainly to groups, the Phyla—a word introduced by Haeckel himself (one of the many new words he invented, although only a few, such as “ecology,” have survived).\n\nThis scheme can be applied to any part of the living world, whether fungi, plant, animal or, by consequence, to the highest pinnacle of evolution, man. In Haeckel’s thought, humans are basically an evolved ape and, looking further back, an evolved worm. The main character that distinguishes man from apes is language and to fill the gaps between speechless apes and speaking man, Haeckel hypothesized a link he called “Pithecanthropus alalus,” which is “speechless apeman.” He had been interested in languages since the days of his friendship with Jena philologist August Schleicher, supporter of an evolutionary interpretation of languages, and was aware of the studies performed by his cousin Wilhelm Bleek in South Africa on the language spoken by the Bushmen, which Bleek suggested represented the nearest approximation to the original language of humankind. Haeckel used Bleek’s studies to claim there was a hierarchy of languages corresponding to the hierarchy of races which spoke them. He claimed that this hierarchy of languages showed that the “lower” human races were closer to apes than to the “higher” races—the highest being the educated man descended from the ancient Greeks. Culture was for Haeckel a much stronger method of studying humans than the physical anthropology propounded by his former teacher Virchow.\n\nA vital aspect of Haeckel’s program of a “unity of culture” was his attempt to provide a bridge between biological science and art, the result of which was the visually dazzling Kunstformen der Natur, the Art Forms of Nature, published in 1904. With the assistance of Jena artist-lithographer Adolf Giltsch, Haeckel produced one hundred plates depicting the forms of animal life, mainly marine animals. With this book, Haeckel wanted to create an “aesthetics of nature” and to show how the incessant struggle for existence he had learnt from Darwin was in fact producing an endless beauty and variety of forms—Darwin and Humboldt combined together.\n\nIn all his works, Haeckel focused on the aspects of knowledge that pointed to a general unitarian outlook, a unity he believed to underlie the superficial diversity of all things. Haeckel called his view of unity “monism,” a term coined in juxtaposition to dualist conceptions, which postulated gaps or oppositions in the explanation of reality in all its aspects. His hostility to dualism was such that over time, he would come to label anything he disliked as dualist. In perfect Orwellian fashion, he held the motto “monist good—dualist bad” as his main guiding mantra. This monism became a real philosophy, a theology and an ideology. In it, there was no room for the traditional Christian God, which science, Haeckel said with dubious humour, had reduced to a mere “gaseous vertebrate.”\n\nRather than an atheism, however, Haeckel saw a unity of God and nature in a conception reminiscent of Spinoza’s Pantheism. Following his main theological influence, David Friedrich Strauss, Haeckel believed that science had killed the traditional concept of God and replaced it with the forces of nature, which were best made sense of by the modern theory of evolution. Thus evolution—Darwinism combined with Lamarck—was the foundation that made possible the modern worldview. No dualism, no divine creation, no afterlife, just the eternal existence of force and matter in incessant change. Individuals were the ephemeral means for the maintenance of force and matter, and into the eternal substance of the universe from which they had come they would return: from here to eternity. Monism became a true movement and the Monist League became a major reference for the educated free-thinkers around the turn of the century, Haeckel being openly advocated as the “anti-pope.”\n\nThe very beginning of the twentieth century saw the publication of Die Welträtsel (The Riddle of the Universe), which served to summarize and expound all his main views. The book was widely read and translated into many languages. It made Haeckel possibly the most famous scientist of the time. It was the triumph of progress and monism, the light for the new path that mankind had to follow in order to build a brave new world. But a tragic event seemed to destroy that plan—the First World War. Haeckel was devastated, blaming it all on British greed. When the war was over, however, he did regain some of his optimism, not realizing though that with the war, his dream of progress through evolution and the final marriage of scientific and artistic truth was smashed, and with it too the fame of Professor Ernst Haeckel.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some ways that mobile devices can be used to study foreign languages?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Only a few decades ago, studying a foreign language on one’s own was, mildly speaking, difficult. A person who decided to dedicate their time to doing this condemned themselves to spending countless hours in libraries, digging into cumbersome dictionaries and grammar textbooks, and desperate attempts to find audio materials to train pronunciation. In other words, studying a foreign language was something like an act of valor, and a self-taught person speaking two or three foreign languages could be considered a hero—and for a good reason. These times are no more, however; the Internet and the emergence of mobile technologies has given people the opportunity to not only communicate, but to connect with the whole world; and, respectively, to learn any languages necessary for such a connection. Of course, textbooks and language schools are reasonable options, but along with them, there are a number of ways to study foreign language by oneself, and for free—one of them is mobile applications.\n\nThere are a great number of apps designed for both Android and iOS meant to help a person not only memorize new words or learn a couple of useful expressions, but to study grammar, practice writing and pronunciation, and proceed to the advanced levels of using a foreign language.\n\nHelloTalk, for example—an app designed by a Chinese company for iOS and Android—is a popular language exchange platform, connecting language enthusiasts from all over the world. It is available for free, and provides its users with the ability to learn a foreign language by communicating with native speakers. What a new user needs to do is to specify their native language, and the language they are studying; the application will then look for matches—people whose native language you want to study, and who are interested in your native language. HelloTalk includes powerful translation and spell-checking tools, as well as a voice machine, allowing a user to listen to the original pronunciation of a foreign word or phrase. For a subscription fee, HelloTalk provides the ability to specify up to three spoken and studied languages, along with additional tools for more effective learning. There is also a possibility to purchase HelloTalk completely, without having to pay for a monthly subscription.\n\nLext Talk is another free application designed for iOS, and working on the same principles as HelloTalk. It possesses, however, several unique and useful features, such as a map on which a user can see other people using Lext Talk, and their language pairs. The program also includes chat rooms; whatever language you are studying, there will be a chat room with people studying the same language, so you can practice your chosen language anytime.\n\nThese are just two of the countless specialized apps designed for language exchange and learning; at the same time, there exists a number of other ways smartphones and tablets can assist a person to study foreign languages. For example, both App Store and Google Play comprise all kinds of dictionaries; most of them are created for English speakers, although it is possible to find a dictionary made for your language as well (if you are not a native English speaker). This is not to mention Google Translate—a powerful and useful tool for quickly translating short phrases or single words; translating vast volumes of text with its help is not advisable, though, since the accuracy of translation in this case drops significantly. Besides, Google Translate does not work so well with Asian languages, such as Chinese or Japanese.\n\nGadgets allow its users to download and read any e-book formats; any e-reader can turn one’s smartphone into a digital linguistic library, with any kind of textbook on any language. Watching foreign movies with subtitles in one’s native language can also be helpful. In case you need to note something down, you can always use either built-in or downloaded notepads, such as Evernote or Google Keep. One of the efficient ways to study a foreign language if you are a traveler is to read and translate all kinds of signs and advertisements. A regular camera on your phone or tablet can become a great assistant: when walking around a city in a foreign country, you can take pictures and later use them to look up for unfamiliar words in a dictionary.\n\nGadgets working under Android, iOS, or other operating systems can enhance language studying efficiency, or even enable its users to learn a language from zero. The most effective means for this are language exchange applications, such as HelloTalk or Lext Talk; they usually let their users communicate with native language speakers around the world, thus allowing to obtain first-hand foreign language communication experience. At the same time, iOS and Android app markets contain thousands of dictionaries and textbooks, which also can (and should) be used for studying. Downloaded e-books and movies in foreign languages, notepads, and cameras can become an efficient means of studying as well. So, instead of killing time playing Angry Birds, one might want to use their gadget as a learning tool—modern mobile devices are perfectly suited for this purpose.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the significance of the Western Wall in Jerusalem?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Jerusalem is often referred to as the city of three religions. Throughout the thousands of years that it has existed, this city had been conquered, ruined, rebuilt, and conquered again countless times—Islamic, Christian, and Jewish forces struggled to gain control over Jerusalem. There were also times when the city was peacefully inhabited by the representatives of all three religions; those were the times of extensive construction, development, cultural exchange, and trade. During these periods, a lot of significant and nowadays famous places were raised, which now serve as objects of pilgrimage for hundreds of thousands of people all over the world. However, there is one place in Jerusalem that is not only the most ancient among all the holy places of this city, but probably the holiest one: the remnants of the Second temple, the Western Wall.\n\nThis is indeed a great and unique place; built in a Jewish city, being a holy place for innumerable Jewish people, the Western Wall is, at the same time, a place for everyone’s prayer. There is no religion whose adepts would be prohibited to pray near the wall. As the Bible says, when King Solomon built the first Temple, he asked God to hear and answer the prayers of not only Jewish people, but of others as well (1-Kings 8:41-43). In the prophet Isaiah’s revelations, the Western Wall is called “a house of prayer for all nations,” and according to the Kabbalah, prayers said near the wall will ascend directly to heaven, regardless of whom they were said by. As a proof of these stories, any day when you come the wall, you will see a diverse crowd, dozens of ethnicities and hundreds of people, praying and crying near it. Why crying? When the first Temple was destroyed, the Gates of Heaven, almost all of them, were shut; the only Gate remaining open was called the Gate of Tears—this is what the legend says; this is why people, when coming to the wall, pour out their tears, and this is why the Western Wall is also often called the Wailing Wall (Jerusalem Insiders Guide).\n\nThere is an interesting legend surrounding the destruction of the Temple. As the construction of the Temple started, the work on its different sections was divided between various social groups. The part now known as the Western Wall was assigned to poor people, who had no money to hire someone to do their job instead of themselves, and thus they had to work as hard as they could. When Romans destroyed the Temple, it was only the Western Wall that persisted the destruction; it is said that the angels descended from heaven, spreading their wings to protect the Wall, claiming: “This Wall, the work of the poor, shall never be destroyed” (Aish.com). This is why the Western Wall is the only fragment of the ancient Temple that remained almost intact. The destruction of the second Temple and the fortunate destiny of the Western Wall that made Talmudic sages believe: “This is the Western Wall of the Temple, which is never destroyed for the shekhinah [the Divine presence] is in the west” (Bamidbar Rabah 11:63) (GoIsrael).\n\nThe first Temple, built by Solomon, was destroyed in 586 BC by the Babylonians; the Western Wall and the second Temple was built later by King Herod the Great, wishing to restore the Temple to its former glory. The Western Wall was one of four walls King Herod built to support the huge plaza on which the Temple stood. Its length was almost 1,500 feet long, and the height reached 90 feet; about 60 feet of the Wall went under the ground. The second Temple, however, could not avoid the destruction either: in 70 CE, it was burnt down by the Romans, except legend says, for the Western Wall. During the division of Jerusalem, between 1948 and 1967, Jewish people were completely separated from the Wall, as it had happened countless times in the past, when they had to overcome all kinds of obstacles and subject themselves to dangers, only to commit a pilgrimage to this holy place. After the Six Day War in 1967, Jerusalem was reunited, and the Western Wall once again became a place of worship, unity with the divine, and the symbol of love and devotion of the Jewish people for their Holy City (GoIsrael).\n\nThe Western Wall is one of the most miraculous and sacred places on earth. It is said that the prayers spoken near the Wall are never left unanswered. Being a demonstrative illustration of the hardships Jewish people had gone through for centuries, the Wall is, at the same time, a symbol of faith and devotion, a holy place of pilgrimage for people of all religions, and a true religious wonder that has endured for thousands of years until present days.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the five stages of the grieving process for a breakup?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Sometimes it happens: a person dearest to you suddenly says, “We cannot be together anymore.” You see him or her gather things, shut the door, and your mind goes numb. A huge part of your life, a huge piece of yourself is gone, and while your brain is stalled, desperately trying to realize the new situation and keep to the ground that is quickly shattering under your feet, deep inside your chest you somehow feel: this is real, and this is forever.\n\nBreakups are painful. Unlike many people believe, it is painful for the both sides: the dumper, if he or she truly loved you for a period of time, feels probably the same pain as you do. It is just that when he or she finally decides to leave you, they are often already past the shock and grief. As for the dumpee, it is only the beginning. And, unlike many Internet articles suggest, there is no quick way to deal with the pain; there is no shortcut, no magic pill that would help the dumpee suddenly wake up and feel alright. A breakup is a loss, and as in case of any loss, there will be grief and all the circles of hell.\n\nIn fact, there are going to be four of these circles, and then the exit from hell. The four circles, or stages of mourning are denial, anger, bargaining, and depression; the exit is acceptance, but we will talk about it later.\n\nDenial is the reaction of your psyche aimed at protecting your personality from the incredible intensity of the initial post-breakup emotions. Denial can last for minutes or days, depending on what kind of person you are. Sometimes (although it is a pathology, and not common or typical) denial can last for decades: in fact, as well as each of the other stages. When in the denial stage, a dumpee often believes his\/her ex has made a mistake, got confused, and will eventually realize it and return. After this usually comes anger: “How could he\/she do this to me?” Many people find it difficult or even impossible to feel anger towards a person they held so dear, and instead direct this anger towards themselves, or try to choke it out somehow. It is important to let yourself feel anger: write hateful emails, tear up all your ex’s photos to pieces, break contact with him or her (and usually a dumpee tries to maintain contact with an ex during the denial stage), and so on. This anger is the result of frustration caused by a sudden breakup, and is natural; during this stage, it is important to let anger out, but in a way that will not harm other people physically or emotionally. Next comes bargaining: a dumpee hopes the relationship can be restored, and starts the attempts to return to their ex. And then there comes depression: a period of deep sadness, reflection, analysis of the mistakes made by both partners, tears, and isolation. During this period, it is important to not try to shove away the negative feelings with alcohol, drugs, rebound relationships, or in any other way, but feel this deep melancholy, and stay in it while it lasts. And finally, as a way out of hell, there comes acceptance. This is also a part of the grieving process, but compared to the previous four, it brings a person hope instead of suffering. Not the hope for reconciliation with an ex, but the hope—or better said, knowledge—that a dumpee can make it alone. Acceptance is the period or letting go, when one realizes that nothing can be fixed, nothing from the past is coming back, so he or she learns to live out his or her own life, and learns to understand and enjoy themselves and his or her life (Livestrong.com). Acceptance cannot be rushed; it comes only if the previous stages of grief have been passed completely—this is why it is crucial that one does not try to skip any of the stages.\n\nAll this does not mean, however, that one needs to go through the grieving process alone. It is natural during this period to feel isolated, or even to try isolate oneself. At the same time, there are many people around who can make dealing with the breakup easier; reaching out to good friends or family members is a helpful and wise first step in the recovery process—especially if any of them had gone through the same hardships before. It is crucial that one can trust these people, and that they are fully over their broken relationships—otherwise, a dumpee’s negativity can only be refueled. A supporting person must be able to listen to a dumpee without judging, criticizing, giving advice, and so on. If all of one’s friendships are connected to an ex, it is recommended to see a counselor or a psychotherapist who will help the dumpee get through the grieving process without getting stuck in each of the phases. Making new friendships, or joining a support group of people who have found themselves in the same situation can also help. Interests clubs, lectures, community activities, and so on are also an alternative to staying alone 24\/7 and rummaging in one’s broken feelings (HelpGuide.org).\n\nIt is also important that a person takes good care of themselves. It is easy to put one’s hands down, start ignoring one’s own needs, and float with the river of sadness. However, this—along with trying to ignore or suppress one’s negative feelings—is a part of what holds recovery back. Therefore, during the period of grief, it is important to eat healthy food, exercise, have enough sleep, and avoid unnecessary stress (HelpGuide.org).\n\nBreakups are never easy. Sometimes it takes a person years to get fully over someone who dumped them, and it depends not only on psychic constitution, so to say, but also on how (and whether) this person had passed all the five stages of the grieving process. This process includes denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, and it is important that each of these stages is completely realized, felt, and lived through. Only in this case can one can fully recover and become able to build new, stronger, and more satisfying relationships.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the history of Ryoanji temple and its famous stone garden?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When speaking of Japan, most people imagine a certain set of things: Fujisan (also known as Fujiyama), sushi, geisha, samurai, anime, shinobi (often incorrectly called “ninja”), weird TV shows, crowded megalopolises, Pearl Harbor, a traditional society, and so on. More “advanced” adepts will probably mention Zen Buddhism, koto and shamisen musical instruments, Noh and Kabuki theater, shoguns, and Sengoku-jidai—the period when Japan was torn apart by devastating civil wars. And probably, some of these people will mention one of the true wonders of ancient and modern Japan: Ryoanji, a temple in Kyoto where a famous stone garden is located.\n\nThe history of Ryoanji temple is ancient and mysterious. Ryoanji was built on the lands of the Fujiwara clan, famous throughout the 8th-12th centuries. These grounds had been bought in the middle of the 15th century by Hosokawa Katsumoto, the deputy of the shogun and a warlord, who built his mansion (and the temple) there (although there is a theory that the temple had been built about 40 years later by a Zen monk named Souami). During the Onin war, one of the many wars tearing Japan apart during that historical period, the residence had been destroyed, and then rebuilt by Katsumoto’s son, Hosokawa Matsumoto, in 1488. Anyways, after the reconstruction, Ryoanji stood there for almost 300 hundred years, until completely burning down in 1797 and being reconstructed again, supposedly in 1799. Since that time, the temple has not changed much (Real Japanese Gardens).\n\nAs for the history of the rock garden of Ryoanji, the facts are less specific, and are surrounded by a number of speculations. One of the assumed designers is the aforementioned monk Souami, who is believed to have made the garden look as we know it today: a rectangular square surrounded with low earthen walls and filled with pebbles, in which five groups of rocks lie. There are in total 15 rocks in the garden, but it is designed in such a way that from whatever point a viewer looks at them, he or she will be able to see only 14 rocks at a time: the 15th rock will always remain concealed from sight. It is unclear what meaning the designer intended to imbue the garden with; supposedly, the rock composition embodies infinity or other abstract concepts like this, but there are no clues regarding the meaning of these rocks, so each viewer has to find this meaning for himself or herself (japan-guide.com).\n\nBefore the works of Japanese scholar D.T. Suzuki had become popular in the West, Ryoanji had remained unfamiliar to the public. However, Dr. Suzuki’s numerous works on Zen Buddhism and culture had caused a true explosion of popularity of “everything Zen” in the western world, and Ryoanji has gradually become a symbol of Zen tradition—especially after it was visited by Queen Elizabeth II. (Kinukake.com). Nowadays, Ryoanji is a popular tourist destination not only among Japanese people, but globally, attracting those interested in Zen, wishing to get in touch with an ancient and mysterious culture, or trying to find themselves, their place in the world, and struggling to solve the riddle of Ryoanji’s rocks.###"}
{"prompt":"How does the energy of a vibration depend on its amplitude?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Using the example of a mass on a spring, we find that there are two forms of energy involved: the potential energy stored in the spring and the kinetic energy of the moving mass. We may start the system in motion either by hitting the mass to put in kinetic energy or by pulling it to one side to put in potential energy. Either way, the subsequent behavior of the system is identical. It trades energy back and forth between kinetic and potential energy (we are still assuming there is no friction, so that no energy is converted to heat, and the system never runs down).\n\nThe most important thing to understand about the energy content of vibrations is that the total energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude. Although the total energy is constant, it is instructive to consider two specific moments in the motion of the mass on a spring as examples. When the mass is all the way to one side, at rest and ready to reverse directions, all its energy is potential. We have already seen that the potential energy stored in a spring equals (1\/2)kx2(1\/2)kx2, so the energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude. Now consider the moment when the mass is passing through the equilibrium point at x=0x=0. At this point, it has no potential energy, but it does have kinetic energy. The velocity is proportional to the amplitude of the motion, and the kinetic energy, (1\/2)mv2(1\/2)mv2, is proportional to the square of the velocity, so again we find that the energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude. The reason for singling out these two points is merely instructive; proving that energy is proportional to A2A2 at any point would suffice to prove that energy is proportional to A2A2 in general, since the energy is constant.\n\nAre these conclusions restricted to the mass-on-a-spring example? No. We have already seen that F=−kxF=−kx is a valid approximation for any vibrating object, as long as the amplitude is small. We are thus left with a very general conclusion: the energy of any vibration is approximately proportional to the square of the amplitude, provided that the amplitude is small.\n\nIf water is poured into a U-shaped tube, it can undergo vibrations about equilibrium. The energy of such a vibration is most easily calculated by considering the “turnaround point” when the water has stopped and is about to reverse directions. At this point, it has only potential energy and no kinetic energy, so by calculating its potential energy, we can find the energy of the vibration. This potential energy is the same as the work that would have to be done to take the water out of the right-hand side down to a depth AA below the equilibrium level, raise it through a height AA, and place it in the left-hand side. The weight of this chunk of water is proportional to AA, and so is the height through which it must be lifted, so the energy is proportional to A2A2.\n\n▹▹ The amplitude of vibration of your eardrum at the threshold of pain is about 106,106 times greater than the amplitude with which it vibrates in response to the softest sound you can hear. How many times greater is the energy with which your ear has to cope for the painfully loud sound, compared to the soft sound?\n\n▹▹ The amplitude is 106,106 times greater, and energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude, so the energy is greater by a factor of 101,210,12. This is a phenomenally large factor!\n\nNote that because of the huge range of energies that our ears can sense, it would not be reasonable to have a sense of loudness that was additive. Consider, for instance, the following three levels of sound:\n\nbarely audible wind\n\nquiet conversation …….\n\n105 times more energy than the wind\n\nheavy metal concert …..\n\n1012 times more energy than the wind\n\nIn terms of addition and subtraction, the difference between the wind and the quiet conversation is nothing compared to the difference between the quiet conversation and the heavy metal concert. Evolution wanted our sense of hearing to be able to encompass all these sounds without collapsing the bottom of the scale so that anything softer than the crack of doom would sound the same. So rather than making our sense of loudness additive, mother nature made it multiplicative. We sense the difference between the wind and the quiet conversation as spanning a range of about 5\/12 as much as the whole range from the wind to the heavy metal concert. Although a detailed discussion of the decibel scale is not relevant here, the basic point to note about the decibel scale is that it is logarithmic. The zero of the decibel scale is close to the lower limit of human hearing, and adding 1 unit to the decibel measurement corresponds to multiplying the energy level (or actually the power per unit area) by a certain factor.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the pros and cons of learning the Chinese language?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Several decades ago, people wanting to learn a foreign language tended to pay more attention to European languages: Spanish (probably because it is spoken by a large number of people all over the world), French, and sometimes German; more exotic options included Arabic or Russian. However, in 2016, it has become obvious that the most prospective foreign languages to learn is Chinese. This is not just because of the enormous quantity of Chinese people living around the world, but also due to the fact that China is one of the most rapidly developing countries, and definitely the most influential economic, cultural, industrial, and political country in Asia. Considering the pace in which China is developing, it looks like its language can become—in a not-too-distant future—as important for international relationships as English. Therefore, learning it now is one of the best investments a person can make.\n\nThere are, however, several things a Chinese language learner should consider. One of the most important ones (and the one not all people take into consideration or even know of) is that there is no single Chinese language; China is huge, and every ethnic group inhabiting it has its own dialect. So, if a person from Southern China, for example, talks to a person from Northern China, both of them will not understand each other, or understand little. This happens due to severe phonetic differences between dialects, although grammar and writing are mostly the same—this is why we can speak of Chinese language as one. So, before starting to study this language, a person should first decide on the dialect he or she is going to focus on; the best choice might be Mandarin, or Putonghua—the “official Chinese,” so to say. Recently, it has started to be taught in schools all over China, so the aforementioned communication difficulties will eventually disappear or become less obstructing.\n\nThe second thing one must know is that Chinese grammar is much easier than English grammar. Nouns have no number or gender, sentence structure is straightforward, and basically, you can make up new words if you forgot a specific one—a Chinese person will most likely understand you (for example, if you forgot the word “airplane” you can use the words “flying” and “machine”). However, the devil is in details, as they say. Chinese pronunciation is extremely difficult for a beginner due to a complicated system of tones: ways of pronouncing vowels. Every Chinese word is simultaneously a syllable, and many words consist of two syllables at least. Depending on the way you pronounce a vowel in each of these syllables, the meaning of the whole word or phrase can change drastically. There are four tones, and their combinations—sometimes seemingly impossible to use together in a regular two-syllable word—are what gives newbie Chinese language students regular headaches.\n\nThis is not to mention Chinese writing. Before 1949, there was no way to write down Chinese phonetics, which was one of the reasons why about 80% of Chinese people remained illiterate (Academic.edu). After the government started a language reform, the Pinyin alphabet was implemented; Pinyin consists of Latin letters allowing to write down characters’ transcriptions, which has made learning characters supposedly easier. The difficulty that still prevails, though, is the enormous amount of characters used in Chinese language on a daily basis. A graduate of a Chinese university or college knows about 6,000 characters, which is sufficient to read, write, and work. However, for a foreigner not immersed in the language environment, understanding characters remain one of the main difficulties for years.\n\nBesides, the Chinese language extensively utilizes all kinds of phraseology and sayings, often revolving around famous (in China) historical figures, events, mythological motifs, and so on. For a person not proficient in Chinese culture, such phraseology can become an obstacle.\n\nThe Chinese language is extremely diverse, complicated, and unusual—but this is also what makes it so attractive and interesting for a foreigner to learn. Compared to European languages, the Chinese language will take at least three times as much time to become more or less fluent, but the reward for mastering it is immense: becoming a participant in one of the richest and the most ancient cultures in the world, as well as being able to work and study in China (because English is almost useless in China—almost no one speaks it there), is definitely worth spending years studying one of the most difficult languages in the world.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the positive effects of western classical music on the human mind?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One of the finest examples of cultural legacy that humanity has produced so far, and that will undoubtedly endure through centuries, is western classical music. Being extremely diverse in its nature and sound, the moods it creates, and the instruments it comprises, western classical music has for a long time remained a phenomenon, drawing the attention of psychologists around the world. And, according to numerous studies, western classical music has not just artistic and cultural value, but also causes a number of unexpected and (fortunately) positive effects on the human mind—some of which will be discussed below.\n\nDr. Gordon Shaw of the University of California-Irvine discovered in 1993 that western classical music can provoke temporary spikes in intellectual capabilities of students who were listening to Mozart. At the same time, this effect was not observed in control groups, who listened to other kinds of music, which allowed to suggest that it is specifically western classical music causing these “intellectual spikes.” This caused a bunch of simplifications, such as the statement, “listening to Mozart makes people smarter” which, in fact, were not exactly true. What Dr. Shaw’s research implied is that listening to Mozart could be a great warm-up for the mind engaging in abstract thinking (Livestrong.com).\n\nThis effect has been called the “Mozart Effect,” and several more studies have revealed some of its other beneficial effects, along with the positive influence on brain activity. For example, the study conducted by Chakravarthi Kanduri, Computational Biology Researcher at the University of Helsinki, has proved that “listening to classical music enhanced the activity of genes that are mainly related to reward and pleasure, cognitive functions and proper brain function” (Lifehack). This effect works regardless of whether a person has or has no musical experience: people participating in the experiment were divided into two focus groups—one being knowledgeable in classical music, and one without knowledge in classical. Both groups, however, displayed similar results.\n\nThe soothing and stimulating effect of western classical music manifests itself not only on the mind, but also on the body. It was discovered that western classical music can slightly reduce pain, and enhances the healing capabilities of the human body. In particular, classical music can distract people from chronic pain they are experiencing, help them relax, and reduce the levels of stress they are experiencing. It is still a debate, however, whether the healing effects of western classical music has something to do with sound vibrations, or with the fact that it helps a patient to relax and thus soothes pain (feeligoodfeelingreat.com).\n\nYet another positive effect western classical music has (and an important one) is that it can help a person fall asleep better, which should definitely be appreciated by people suffering from insomnia and other sleeping disorders. Once again, this occurs due to the immense relaxing effect western classical music has: by calming down the mind, it makes one’s body “follow,” letting a person fall asleep easier. This effect is so strongly marked that western classical music, along with neutral ambient noises and the sounds of nature, has become one of the favorite “prescriptions” sleep therapists use to help their patients.\n\nWestern classical music is known to have many other positive effects—surprisingly, not only on humans, but also plants and animals. What is invaluable about it is that this kind of music can temporarily boost up one’s intellectual capabilities and effectively help a person enter a more productive and creative state of mind; for those in chronic pain or under treatment, classical music can be a substitute (or at least a complement) to regular painkillers, as it is known to have a property to sooth pain and enhance healing processes occurring in the body; finally, western classical music is one of the favorite therapies of sleep therapists around the world, as it can help a person with sleep disorders relax and fall asleep easier. Western classical music is yet to be studied in more detail, but its therapeutic and augmenting, so to say, effects, are already obvious.###"}
{"prompt":"How does the gestalt approach to psychoanalysis help people become better adjusted to living in everyday reality?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When talking about psychoanalysis, psychology, and mentioning other topics connected to the human psyche, people mostly remember Sigmund Freud, and sometimes Alfred Adler, or even Carl Jung. These three individuals indeed were probably the most influential researchers of psyche of their time; however, it is important to note that besides them, there were many other talented psychologists and psychoanalysts whose theories not only contributed to psychology greatly, but also introduced completely new methods (more effective in terms of time and results) of treating various psychological conditions and improving patients’ quality of life. One of such researchers was Frederick “Fritz” Perls, a German psychoanalyst and one of the founders of the gestalt approach in psychotherapy. His method has saved and improved life of thousands of people around the world, and is now recognized as one of the most effective and wholesome ones.\n\nFrederick Perls was born in a Jewish family in 1893 in Berlin. As a young man, he was fascinated by Sigmund Freud’s theory; after he demobilized from World War I, Perls started treating soldiers with head and brain traumas, and this work had drew him even closer to psychoanalysis. He entered the Berlin Institute of Psychoanalysis, and then moved to Vienna to continue his studies. When Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime started to gain strength, Frederick Perls and his wife, Laura Perls, moved to South Africa in 1933. During World War II, Frederick Perls joined the army once more, and worked as a psychiatrist there. After moving to New York in 1946, Perls family settled down in Manhattan. There, Frederick had a chance to work with such famous scientists as Karen Horney and Wilhelm Reich, although his most productive cooperation in the field of psychological studies occurred with Paul Goodman and Ralph Hefferline; together with the latter two, in 1951, Frederick Perls wrote and published a book called Gestalt Therapy: Excitement and Growth in the Human Personality. This book was based on Perls’ own experiences and research he obtained during previous years, and after its success, in the same year, Perls and his wife founded the New York Institute for Gestalt Therapy. Since that time, the gestalt approach gained more and more popularity, proving its efficiency time after time (GoodTherapy.org).\n\nBut what exactly is gestalt, and how is it different from other approaches, rather numerous, to psychoanalysis? Gestalt therapy is also often addressed as a humanistic therapy technique, the main purpose of which is to help an individual develop self-awareness regarding their own emotions, needs, and behaviors. Unlike Freud’s (and many other) approaches to psychoanalysis, gestalt focuses on the present rather than on the past; another prominent difference is that a therapist does not “tell” a patient what their problem is based on what this patient says; instead, the therapist and the patient work together on helping the latter understand himself\/herself better. Ideally, a person should be able to realize the constant flow of their feelings and needs, and become able to “meet” with them and satisfy them (The Free Dictionary).\n\nThe word “Gestalt” is German, and it is rather difficult to find an appropriate translation for it in English. Gestalt can be vaguely described as “a pattern,” and Perls himself stressed that the understanding of anything, be it a person or a situation, is possible only considering it as a whole entity, with its components creating a particular form at a particular time (GestaltTheory.com). By developing self-awareness, becoming able to fully understand one’s own motives, needs, and feelings, a person can better integrate themselves in their own reality, participate in their life actively and consciously, get rid of complexes and inner conflicts, and in general receive more satisfaction from daily activities. This becomes possible in close contact with reality.\n\nFrederick Perls lived a fulfilling, active life, and the psychotherapeutic approach he and his colleagues have developed help people all over the world do the same: come in closer contact with themselves, realize what they truly want, resolve their inner conflicts, and take responsibility over their own lives. Gestalt focuses on helping a person develop self-awareness, become able to recognize, differentiate, and integrate their own emotions, sensations, experiences, and needs. As a result, a person can resolve the majority (if not all) of their inner conflicts, and become better adjusted to living in everyday reality.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the importance of developing emotional intelligence?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Children learn to perceive and interact with the world in a number of ways; one of the major channels through which children receive knowledge and experience are parents. By observing parents’ emotional reactions, facial expressions, by obeying or disobeying their verbal and non-verbal prescriptions, children adopt a complex of social norms and behaviors, which they will use to interact with the world around them. At the same time, based on parents’ reactions to their needs, actions, and feelings, children also learn to express themselves, to understand themselves, and form their self-esteem. And, probably, the most valuable skill a person can obtain in early childhood is being able to feel and express emotions freely.\n\nParenthood is not the only factor defining the character and temperament of each particular individual, but it is definitely among the most influential ones. Unfortunately, not all parents realize the importance of teaching children to stay in touch with their emotions—understand and embrace them, express them in socially acceptable ways, listen to the needs these emotions point at, and so on. This is especially important in the case of negative emotions: anger, rage, sadness, envy, and so on. Many parents directly or indirectly forbid their children to express them, causing a great deal of harm to children without often realizing it. Nowadays, when western society is living in a state of constant frustration, when depression is the second major cause of disability around the world, restoring the connection to emotions and developing emotional intelligence becomes a top priority task for every living person.\n\nBut what is this emotional intelligence? One of the numerous definitions (and perhaps one of the most exact) states that emotional intelligence “refers to an ability to recognize the meanings of emotions and their relationships, and to reason and problem-solve on the basis of them. Emotional intelligence is involved in the capacity to perceive emotions, assimilate emotion-related feelings, understand the information of those emotions, and manage them” (UNH). Unfortunately, developed emotional intelligence still remains the privilege of a relative minority of people; for many of them, the capacity to even recognize their own emotions is disrupted, due to various reasons. When feeling angry, depressed, outrageous, detached, or negative in some other way, people usually prefer to avoid direct contact with their sensations and suppress what they feel. This is probably why alcohol and entertainment industries are so popular and developed around the world.\n\nAt the same time, as we can see from the definition above, emotions—even negative ones—play an extremely important role in our daily lives. One of the primary functions of negative emotions is to point at our needs that have been ignored or remained unsatisfied in some other way. For example, many people feel envious when their friends, colleagues, or other people achieve something they do not have yet, or will not have in the future. Envy—although often being labeled as an unworthy emotion or even as a sin—in fact tells us what we want or need, even if you do not realize it yet (IFR). If you are indifferent to automobiles and your friend buys a new car, most likely you will not feel envious—a car is not among your needs or wants, so you remain calm; you might even feel sincerely happy for your friend. However, if you desperately wanted a car but could not afford one, and your friend keeps posting happy photos of himself in a new car, you will probably feel this heavy, sometimes painful sensation in your chest: the want, the chagrin that someone has what you cannot afford (and want for yourself, deep inside).\n\nHaving one or several of negative emotions can be confusing and frustrating—usually because of social and religious norms. Many of us have this stereotype that “feeling envious\/angry\/sad makes you a bad\/weak\/sinful person.” As a result, in addition to the unpleasant sensation of envy, a person gets the feeling of guilt for feeling something “unacceptable.” Such a person will probably try to somehow hide this emotion, suppress it, try to distract themselves from it; however, unless the unsatisfied need is there, this will not help. The same refers to anger, sadness, and other “negatives.”\n\nAt the same time, those people who possess developed emotional intelligence or at least those who are capable of recognizing their own emotions, will not feel bad about the negative emotions they have. Instead, they will try to figure out (and most likely they will) what stands behind a certain emotion: who or what caused it, what its meaning is, what need or situation it points at, and what can be done to let this emotion go. Envy can become a motivator for you to make more effort towards achieving something you want—or it can at least show your true needs. Anger, being pure energy, can give you strength to overcome obstacles and move towards your goal; it can also help you defend yourself (physically or psychologically). Fear is a perfect alarm system, preserving you from getting in trouble. Sadness slows you down, giving your nervous system time to heal, making you revise your values, needs, sensations, letting you store energy to become able to move on. And of course, the same refers to positive emotions. Happiness and joy make you feel better, gives you energy, and helps you perpetuate behaviors that turned out to be effective in achieving a goal or satisfying a need; curiosity motivates you to learn something new; and so on (IFR).\n\nEmotions are key to understanding yourself. They are a shortcut to the depths of your personality, helping you navigate through reality, filling the cognitive gap that rational and logical thinking cannot cover. Emotions can define your behaviors entirely if you succumb to them, but the good news is that it is possible to manage emotions—not by suppressing or ignoring them, but by giving them a constructive direction instead, clothing them in socially-acceptable forms, and letting them flow freely. To do so, one must be able to face their emotions directly, accept all of them even if they seem inappropriate, understand what they mean, and act based on this understanding. This is basically what emotional intelligence is, and this is why it is so important to develop it.###"}
{"prompt":"How does Jack London's novel The Star Rover explore the idea of sensory deprivation and overload?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This article [Astral Travels with Jack London] was originally published in The Public Domain Review [http:\/\/publicdomainreview.org\/2016\/11\/22\/astral-travels-with-jack-london\/] under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0. If you wish to reuse it please see: http:\/\/publicdomainreview.org\/legal\/”\n\nBy Benjamin Breen\n\nTwenty times a day, a catamaran sets out from the Northern California town of Larkspur. The vessel traces a graceful arc southward toward the San Francisco Ferry building, passing outcroppings of red boulders, low hills of golden grass, and the occasional houseboat. Before long, the skyline of San Francisco appears, pearly white and silver towers surmounting the permanent bank of fog that shrouds the Golden Gate. The tourists who throng at starboard to take in the view rarely notice that another landmark looms directly behind them. San Quentin.\n\nThe prison’s environs are disarmingly beautiful. The building itself, of course, is as stern as one would expect a maximum-security penitentiary to be—all stained concrete walls and grim, cathedral-like buttresses. But the landscape is enchanting. At night, with crickets humming in the hills and mist-shrouded stars glowing above San Francisco, the juxtaposition feels dreamlike, hallucinatory. It is here, in this prison amid paradise, that the action of Jack London’s The Star Rover plays out.\n\nLondon’s sole foray into the realm of science fiction and fantasy is simultaneously a hard-bitten, minimalist monologue about life in solitary confinement and an exuberant tour of the universe. The book’s narrator, Darrell Standing, moves disarmingly from the agony of his confinement in a strait-jacket to his travel amidst the stars equipped with a glass wand that allows him to access an infinity of past lives, including a fourth-century hermit, a shipwrecked seal-hunter, a medieval swordsman, and a confidant of Pontius Pilate. It is a novel about sensory deprivation in a shared reality, and sensory overload in a private one.\n\nThis is a deeply eclectic book. It borrows liberally from the forebears of the fantasy genre: fairy stories, Norse legend, Greek myths. But it also manages to include feuding UC Berkeley scientists, “dope fiends,” Neolithic hunter-gatherers, kimchi, and a journalistic exposé of the modern prison system. The bizarre multiplicity is precisely the point. London’s narrative does many things, but it always seems to circle back to the question of how the worlds encompassed within a single consciousness can interfere with the shared reality of modern society. As we hurtle towards a near future of immersive virtual reality and unceasing digital connectedness, The Star Rover has much to tell us.\n\nThe novel’s evocation of confinement sprang from a painful first-hand experience. London grew up impoverished and fatherless, and he lived rough as a teenager. During the winter of 1894, he served thirty days in the Erie County Penitentiary in Buffalo, jailed for the crime of vagrancy at the age of eighteen. The grimness of this wintry prison stint stuck with London. “Man-handling was merely one of the very minor unprintable horrors of the Erie County Pen,” he wrote in his memoir The Road (1907):\n\nI say “unprintable”; and in justice I must also say indescribable. They were unthinkable to me until I saw them, and I was no spring chicken in the ways of the world and the awful abysses of human degradation. It would take a deep plummet to reach bottom in the Erie County Pen, and I do but skim lightly and facetiously the surface of things as I there saw them.\n\nLondon’s experiences of prison and riding the rails in the fallout of the Panic of 1893 radicalized him. He joined the Socialist Labor Party in 1896 and began giving fiery speeches in Oakland parks. By the time he began The Star Rover—which originally entered the world as a magazine serial in February of 1914—London drifted away from Socialist politics. Yet the narrative retains a vein of gritty realism that recalls the work of his friend Upton Sinclair. The central character Darrell Standing’s confinement in “the jacket” was inspired by London’s interviews with Ed Morrell, a former Old West outlaw who had suffered a brutal period of confinement in San Quentin. Amidst his star roving, Darrell Standing also finds time to reflect on the evils of the Philippine-American War: “It was laughable to behold Science prostituting all the might of its achievement and the wit of its inventors to the violent introducing of foreign substances into the bodies of black folk.”\n\nLondon was wrapping up the writing of The Star Rover when the First World War began. Although he could not have anticipated the looming cataclysm of August 1914, London’s personal life had been in a shambles since the previous summer. That August, his beloved country estate, Wolf House, had burnt to the ground under mysterious circumstances. In the same year, he penned Jack Barleycorn, an autobiographical novel about what London, a severe alcoholic, called “the clear white light of alcohol.” Olivia Laing, in her fabulous book The Trip to Echo Spring: On Writers and Drinking, observes that alcoholic novelists often circle around their disease in their fiction, never quite acknowledging the extent of their own denial. London’s self-described “alcoholic memoir” manages, somehow, to dance around its central subject, never fully acknowledging the substance abuse that would kill him at age forty. “Read John Barleycorn and you will soon enough discover what ails him,” wrote one of London’s acquaintances. “The tragedy is that he does not even seem to know how far gone he is.”###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the most air-polluted cities in the world and what are the reasons for this pollution?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Day after day, the air we breath becomes more and more polluted by industrial, household, traffic, and other kinds of emissions. Huge factories and plants, billions of cars and public transport units, technogenic catastrophes, household aerosols, and other factors cause massive air pollution, decreasing the quality of life in many countries, and negatively affects the health of their citizens. Although, during the recent several decades, there were numerous attempts to reduce or at least control the rates of air pollution, it still remains one of the primary problems humanity needs to deal with—otherwise it may ruin everything. There are some places in the world that already appear like a human-caused apocalypse aftermath: cities whose ecology in terms of air pollution is so poor that it seems impossible to live there.\n\nAccording to CNN, the most air-polluted city on Earth currently is New Delhi. On Sunday, November 5th, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had to proclaim an emergency situation due to high levels of smog. This particular smog was caused by crop field fires in neighboring states, but even apart from this, New Delhi is a city where breathing its air is rather difficult. Due to a number of factors, such as an exponentially growing population (New Delhi has reached 25 million people), industrialization, and urbanization involving coal-fired power plants, and intense traffic with many cars fueled with diesel, it is easy to understand why New Delhi is recognized as the city with the worst air in the world. Besides, wind patterns typical for its winter period exclude proper air circulation, which contributes to making the situation worse. And now, adding to these problems, the recent fires have caused 5,000 schools to cancel classes for three days; the city’s biggest power plant working on coal had to be shut down for 10 days; all the construction operations in the city had to be stopped for several days as well. If the situation does not get better in the next couple of days, city authorities may have to impose vehicle restrictions. If the situation does not improve, Kejriwal might impose odd-even vehicle restrictions that would only permit driving every other day. As the Chief Minister have put it, “Pollution has increased to an extent that (the) outdoors in Delhi are resembling a gas chamber” (EcoWatch).\n\nThe Iranian city of Zabol is another example of a city with incredibly bad air. Located close to the border with Afghanistan, Zabol is rated by the World Health Organization to be the most polluted city in the world. The concentration of harmful particles in Zabol’s air reaches 217 micrograms per cubic meter of air, whereas the limit considered to be safe is only about 60 micrograms. Droughts, climate change, and the loss of wetlands of Hamoun that used to surround the city in the 2000s have caused the situation to become even worse; in particular, the wetlands protected the city from the phenomenon known as “120 days of wind,” when hot and dusty winds would completely abrupt activities of Zabol’s citizens during summers. Nowadays, these dusty winds pollute the city’s air even more; besides, the loss of Hamoun wetlands has caused a dramatic increase in the amount of respiratory infections among citizens: tuberculosis, for instance, have become one of the most drastic and common problems of Zabol (WorldAtlas).\n\nOr, meet Linfen, which used to be the most air-polluted city in the world several years ago. Located in China, Linfen suffers from severe automotive and industrial emissions. In particular, Linfen has a huge number of coal mines located within and nearby it, and the coal industry is definitely not even close to being ecology-friendly. Even though legally-established mines follow regulations regarding air pollution, there are many illegal coal mines as well, which completely ignore not only labor safety precautions, but also recommendations and restrictions regarding harmful emissions. As a result, the air in Linfen is the most toxic air in the world. Besides, it is China, which means lots of people are living in Linfen; it is easy to assume that the number of automobiles and other vehicles operating within the city is huge, and so are the polluting emissions from them (SCGH).\n\nThere are many other cities in the world suffering from bad air, and most of them are located in Asia. This is easy to explain: Asia is industrious, rapidly developing, and is inhabited by an incredible amount of people; at the same time, not all Asian countries have adopted environmentally-friendly laws, or enabled the mechanisms of control over harmful emissions. For the same reason, one can find extremely air-polluted cities in Africa as well. However, as it can be seen, such cities as New Delhi, Zabol, or Linfen suffer the most, perhaps. The reasons are more or less common: enormous populations, intense automotive traffic, growing industries, environmental factors, and disasters. In particular, in Zabol, the situation has worsened with the disappearing of wetlands that had been protecting the city from dusty desert winds; in New Delhi, the current situation is on the brink of catastrophe because of crop fires in neighboring states. Linfen’s problems come mostly from a number of illegal coal mines surrounding the city that do not observe restrictions and rules regarding harmful emissions. The situation in these and other cities with similar circumstances must be constantly monitored, and a number of steps must be taken to improve the quality of air and decrease pollution.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the most challenging languages to learn?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is always good to be able to speak more than one language. Polyglots are valued assets in any company, and in general tend to be more educated and open-minded people; at the same time, learning a foreign language is often considered difficult—a lifetime task that not everyone can accomplish. This is partially true: whereas many languages are relatively easy to learn (mostly European languages), there are several hard nuts to crack among them. Traditionally, the garland for difficulty goes to Asian languages, but there are toughies among western languages as well. Let us take a look at the most challenging languages in terms of mastery—both for English native speakers and people of other cultural origins.\n\nThe Chinese language (precisely, both Mandarin and Cantonese dialects—the two most widely spoken ones) is probably the most difficult language to learn. According to the assessment of the Foreign Language Institute, an English native speaker might need at least 2200 hours (or 88 weeks) to start using this language more or less confidently (ELL). The most common hardship is, obviously, reading and writing: you will need to know about 3500-4000 characters in order to be able to communicate or perceive a written message. The system of characters China uses nowadays is “simplified,” but ironically, it is probably simple only for Chinese people: a foreigner will see even the simplified characters as a set of totally incomprehensible symbols. There is no alphabet in Chinese (except pinyin, a special transcription for Chinese words written in Latin letters), and instead of separate letters, it utilizes entire syllables. To make things more complicated, there are four tones in Chinese (something like intonations), so the same syllable pronounced in four different ways can respectively have four different meanings; some consonants such as “R” are pronounced in a way that might be hard for a westerner to reproduce. This is not to mention a rather peculiar syntax, extremely rigid word order, and the overall specificity of the Chinese way of thinking. All this—and lots of other smaller details—makes Chinese number one in terms of its difficulty to learn.\n\nThe Japanese language treads on the heels of Chinese. The good news about reading and writing is that you will need to learn only around 2500 characters. The bad news is everything else. Japanese culture borrowed Chinese characters about a 1,000 years ago; with true Japanese thrift, these characters were imbued with Japanese meanings and sounding, but the original sounding and semantics were not cast aside—which means that almost every character in this language has both Chinese and Japanese pronunciation and meaning, and to fully understand Japanese text, you need to know them both; many words use partially Chinese, partially Japanese sounding (the so-called “on” and “kun” readings). Japanese has the traditional, older version of Chinese characters, which basically means having to write more strokes. Also, a native English speaker might find Japanese pronunciation difficult, because many words simultaneously include extremely firm and extremely soft (and even whistling) sounds. As for the syntax, it is totally different from what you can find in European languages; verbs in this language often group at the end of a sentence.\n\nYou must have probably guessed already that number three is the Russian language. Spoken by at least 200 million people, it possesses incredibly flexible grammar, which actively uses numerous prefixes, suffixes, and endings (which change depending on a word’s gender, number, tense—altogether!). Russian pronunciation is not that difficult, but there are several unique sounds that you will hardly see in other languages (such as the mysterious vowel Ы, which basically sounds as if someone punched you in the stomach, but you have somehow managed to calmly endure this act, and only made a brief sound). However, along with Russian, there is Hungarian—one of the few European languages that are almost impossible for a foreigner to learn. To start with, Hungarian has 35 distinct cases, with 18 of them being in use constantly. 14 vowels, a heavy dependence on all kinds of idioms and phraseology even in everyday speech, several verb forms, and the overall complexity of pronunciation can make studying Hungarian a nightmare for a non-native person.\n\nThere are definitely other complicated languages, and listing them would take a rather long time. The first three leaders are, however, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian\/Hungarian languages. Long story short, Chinese and Japanese are, in general, 100% different from any western language you probably know. As for Russian and Hungarian languages, they share third place in rating for their overly complicated grammatical structures and pronunciation, as well as for some unique features that probably no other European language possesses.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the most expensive movie scenes in Hollywood history?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hollywood has long been known for the expensive and impressive movies its directors are keen to make. The budget of just one movie of such directors as Michael Bay can probably surpass the budget of a small country; considering the mostly-entertaining nature of Hollywood cinematography, it generally means that visual effects and stunts in modern movies are amazing. Leaving aside the fact that even the most expensive movies with the most impressive visuals can still be poorly received by critics (like “Pearl Harbor” or the recent “Batman vs. Superman,” it is difficult to deny that Hollywood has created a number of movie scenes that will most likely remain in the history of cinema forever.\n\nOne of the best movie franchises released within the recent two decades, “The Matrix” by the Wachowski brothers\/sisters, along with the deep ideas it introduces, can boast of eye-candy visuals and epic scales of action. Bringing the astonishing $735 million at the worldwide box office, “The Matrix Reloaded,” in particular—the second movie in the franchise—has brought fighting action movies to a whole new level, and the proof of it is the infamous scene involving Neo fighting a horde of agent Smiths. It has become the most expensive movie scene in the history of Hollywood (and probably cinematography), mostly because of the incredible amount of high-end CGI used in it. These visual effects look rather good even in 2016, and back in 2003, when the movie was released, they were simply the best. Which, in its turn, caused extensive expenses to be used: about 40% (a reported $40 million) of the whole movie’s budget was spent on this 17 minutes scene. The scene had been worked on for 27 days, and even today it is difficult, if impossible, to find a more or less adequate analogue to it (TheRichest.com).\n\nYet another impressive and expensive movie scene belongs to “The Matrix Reloaded.” The highway pursuit at the end of the film costed its creators about $2.5 million; seemingly not too much, unless you keep in mind the fact that in order to shoot this scene, a whole freeway had been built especially for the movie. As a construction site on an abandoned military base had been used, the military allowed the film crew to build a 1.5 miles long highway, 20 feet walls, and an off ramp. So, even if financially this scene might be not the most expensive one, it is definitely epic in terms of labor and administrative resources used for its creation (HelloTravel).\n\n“Inception” by Christopher Nolan is also an example of a movie in which certain scenes are expensive and resource-consuming not just in terms of money spent on their creation. Christopher Nolan is one of the few directors who, in the age of CGI, still prefers to create the majority of visual effects in his movies in reality, not on the green screen. The scene in which a freight train comes down a street full of cars, crashing and smashing them, for example, does not involve any computer graphics (except the effect of damage the train’s wheels deal to the road, but this one is easy to miss); in order to film it, the movie creators had to build a realistic train around a semi with an extended axle, and drive it through a real street. Certainly, the cars smashed by the locomotive were also real (Listverse).\n\nThe film “Swordfish” included a scene worth $13 million, and involved a helicopter flying around Los Angeles with a bus attached to it, and resulting in a building exploding and collapsing. This scene required hard work and heavy editing and montage, because some moments could not be filmed without risking other people’s lives (for example, the movie creators had a group of people sit in a bus located in front of a green screen, while a helicopter was attached to a crane above it). Unfortunately, this scene had to be removed from the movie when shown in theaters, because of the exploding building—this happened after September 11, 2001. But anyways, this scene remains one of the most expensive in Hollywood’s history (TheRichest.com).\n\nAs it can be seen, movie directors do not hesitate to throw around enormous amounts of money to create movie scenes that would enter into the hearts of an audience, even if these scenes alone are few and take little of the overall movie time. Neo’s fight with agent Smiths in “The Matrix Reloaded” lasts for only 17 minutes, but was worth around $40 million; Christopher Nolan’s “Inception” depicts a scene that, although being far less costly, is still expensive in terms of the labor used to create it: a real, non-CGI train driving down a busy street and smashing real cars is something you do not see in every movie. Finally, “Swordfish,” another famous movie, included a ridiculously expensive ($13 million) scene of a helicopter flying around a city with a bus hanging down from it; the fact that this scene had to be deleted from the theatrical version of the movie makes it even more expensive, in a sense.###"}
{"prompt":"How did Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" come to be?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Modern art is often difficult to appreciate, at least for people who do not display an interest in visual arts such as graphics or paintings. It does not mean modern art is meaningless, or that people who cannot see further than some stains on canvas are stupid (although, both of these options should not be completely neglected). It is rather that modern art is extremely dependent on context, an author’s intentions, and the idea underlying it. Sometimes the meaning is no deeper than just “visual candy,” a masterful combination of colors; sometimes, it is something profound. However, one fact is undeniable: modern art is most likely the pinnacle of what humanity has been able to achieve with paints and canvas.\n\nSpeaking of modern artists, the name of Kazimir Malevich is probably among the first ones to pop up in one’s head. The inventor of suprematism, a devoted and thorough researcher on the theory of visual arts, a tireless experimenter, Malevich’s influence on visual arts as we know them today was, and still is, colossal. His most famous work, his cultural legacy for which he will be always remembered for, is the “Black Square”—a painting that continues to bother and blow people’s minds, though it was painted more than a century ago.\n\nMalevich was not the first artist to experiment with pure geometrical shapes. In 1617, Robert Fludd—an outstanding Englishman, knowledgeable in philosophy, astronomy, and medicine—painted a picture he later called “The Great Darkness.” Although we do not know whether it had any conceptual and theoretical background behind it, the fact it was painted shows that artistic people started searching for new art forms a rather long time ago. In 1843, the French artist Bertall introduced his “Vue de La Hogue.” Paul Bilhaud was famous, in particular, for his painting “Negroes Fighting in a Tunnel at Night.” Paul Gustave Dore, another famous artist, used a black square as a symbol to illustrate dark times in the history of Russia. As we can see, there have been numerous examples of using pitch-black-colored minimalism in art; we can even call some of these attempts suprematist, but it was Malevich who fully researched and embodied the principles of suprematism—in particular, in his famous “Black Square.” Describing the painting itself would be rather difficult, considering the fact that it is nothing but an actual black square, about 80×80 cm, painted with oil on linen. The surface of the painting is somewhat shabby, although the rest of the three black squares are in good condition. Yes, there is more than one Black Square: four of them, to be precise. The original one was done in 1915, the next one in 1923 for the Venetian biennale. The third Black Square was painted by Malevich for the exhibition at the Tretyakov Gallery in 1929. And finally, the fourth square was discovered in 1993, when an unidentified person tried to use it as a collateral to receive a banking loan in a Russian city. And there were not only black squares after all—apart from the Black Square, Malevich also created a red and a white one (The Kompass).\n\nThere are multiple ways to interpret the painting. It has been said the first square was painted in 1915, although Malevich himself claimed it to have appeared in 1913. Indeed, the square’s first appearance occurred in 1913—it was Malevich’s design for a stage curtain used in a futurist opera “Victory over the Sun.” Back then, Malevich worked on a manifesto calling to reject rational thought, together with his friends Mikhail Matyushin (musician) and Aleksei Kruchenykh (poet). “Victory over the Sun” depicted characters who aimed to capture the sun and destroy time, and used a new language, zaum, invented by Kruchenykh and consisting of sounds unrelated to meaning. This must have influenced Malevich a lot; curator Achim Borchardt-Hume says that “Malevich, infused with the spirit of his friend’s linguistic experiments, invented at breath-taking speed a new painterly language made up solely from shapes and colours. He called this language suprematism” (Tate.org.uk).\n\nThere are also rather nihilistic opinions which, however, also must be taken into consideration due to the enigmatic nature of the painting. In particular, according to Robin Greenwood, an art expert, the “Black Square” is “a regrettable artistic gesture without content, a piece of conceptual art second only to Duchamp’s urinal in terms of the damage inflicted upon the direction and health of painting and sculpture.” At the same time, his colleague Dan Coombs thinks of the “Black Square” as an attempt to break through obsolete artistic techniques. “Black Square represents an audacious attempt to push painting beyond the heightened plasticity of cubism, into the realm of pure fact. In it, painting and what it describes become the same thing. The picture is absolute—it no longer represents, it simply is […] Malevich’s paintings, whilst made of simple elements, are extremely complex in their internal relationships. The Black Square is no exception, in the impossibility of separating the square from its ground. […] The Black Square is still in a state of becoming, yet to be perfected. There’s something tantalising about a wonky square. Its imperfection establishes a human dimension to what would otherwise be a cold, abstract ideal” (Abstract Critical).\n\nYet another way to interpret the “Black Square” is to see it as a revolutionary symbol. Malevich himself claimed the square to be the new starting point in art, a sort of a zero from which other new art forms will emerge (and, surprisingly, he was right: suprematist influence can be easily noticed in a large number of modern conceptual artworks). The title of the exhibition where the painting had first been introduced—“0.10”—only supports this thesis. The “Black Square” was, at the same time, a typographic dot, a period at the end of a long sentence of traditional visual arts that conveyed meanings through objects; it was a sign of a new era in art. Probably, Malevich even saw his own style of suprematism as obsolete as well; a suprematist composition was discovered under the black layers of paint, which might be a clue to understand the square. Anyways, the historical period during which the first square appeared was rather unstable: the middle of the World War I, the aftermath of Russian revolution of 1905, and the new revolutionary spirits floating in the air caused unrest, anxiety, and evoked the search for new forms and ways in almost every sphere of life, including art. Perhaps, the square was initially Malevich’s response to (or rather a continuation of) the revolutionary moods gradually filling the minds of Russian citizens back then. Anyways, Malevich did start his own revolution—the artistic one.\n\nThe “Black Square” is indeed an enigmatic and influential painting. There will probably be no end to the debates about it; maybe art critics are simply overthinking the subject, trying to see meaning where there is none, and the “Black Square” is nothing more than a black square—as already stated by many art experts such as Robin Greenwood. At the same time, many of the respected and knowledgeable art critics continue searching for the true and hidden meanings of Malevich’s masterpiece. And, who knows, perhaps one of their interpretations will someday prove true.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the causes of mass extinction?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is not a secret that the ecological situation on our planet is rather complicated. Apart from the common worries about global warming, industrial pollution, and rain forests being cut down, there is also the huge problem of the extinction of species; and while humanity can, hopefully, somehow stop the processes it is directly causing, it is unclear whether this extinction can be prevented or at least slowed down.\n\nAlthough the words “mass extinction” definitely sounds alarming, it is not something uncommon for our planet. At the moment, we are witnessing the sixth mass extinction of species. During the past 500 million years, there already were five mass extinctions (with the largest of them being the Permian-Triassic and the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinctions, 245 and 65 million years ago respectively), causing from 14% to 84% of the genera or families to completely disappear from the fossil record. During the first of them, the majority of the marine invertebrates, as well as a huge number of terrestrial plants and insects disappeared; the second one mostly affected the dinosaurs. Even in a relatively not-so-distant past, some animal species had gone extinct completely: about 11 thousand years ago, during the Pleistocene-Holocene period, about 100 terrestrial species died out, including mammoths, saber tooth tigers, rhinos, and some birds (NCBI).\n\nMoreover, there are two kinds of extinction: the one after which there is no “replacement” of an extinct species with a new, more adapted one—the “dead-end extinction” which is basically the end of a certain evolutionary lineage; and taxonomic extinction, which implies that during the evolutionary process, certain species had changed to such an extent that they should be considered a different species (NCBI).\n\nCurrently, there are 14,000 to 35,000 endangered species only in the United States; 16,928 species worldwide stand on the edge of dead-end human-caused extinction, and in order to save them, a significant amount of effort should be made. This is especially difficult considering the fact that every species’ extinction can lead to the disappearance of other species that are somehow bound to it: for example, if bees die out, many types of plants will not be able to reproduce, and will have either to adapt quickly, or will have to vanish. Such changes tend to accumulate astonishingly fast. Throughout the last five centuries, about 1,000 species of all possible sizes and shapes have gone completely extinct: huge mammals such as woodland bison of West Virginia and Arizona, US: passenger pigeons and Culebra parrots; Rocky Mountain grasshoppers, and so on. And this is just those of them that we can see relatively easy; it is probably impossible to calculate how many kinds of microorganisms disappear every day before scientists even get a chance to discover and study them. The size does not matter for nature: the tiniest organism is as important for the ecosystem as the largest of mammals (Center for Biological Diversity).\n\nThe good news is that it is in fact possible to not only slow down extinction, but to save some species from the danger of vanishing. In the early 1990s, there was a program of reintroducing captive-born condors to their natural environment in California, Arizona, and northern Mexico. Before the program was launched, there were about 20 of these condors left; currently, there are more than 200 of these birds inhabiting their “original” environments. The condor’s recovery, as well as some other examples, shows it is possible to move some species away from the extreme brink. For example, gray wolves, who were almost completely killed during hunting across the whole North America by the end of 1970s, are now a relatively prosperous species counting around 3,500 specimen. Northern elephant seals are nowadays numbered around 150,000 along the West Coast, although there were fewer than a hundred of them left alive just recently. All this became possible due to the significant efforts of reintroduction (National Geographic).\n\nMoreover, with the power of science, it is possible not only to reintroduce endangered animals to their natural environments, but to bring back those of them that are believed to have completely disappeared. New discoveries in genetics, in particular the advancements connected to CRISPR-Cas9, give humanity hope of bringing back animals considered to have disappeared forever. Ecologists at the University of California, Santa Barbara, believe the two species that would be especially reasonable to resurrect are the woolly mammoth, the last of which died about 4000 years ago, and the passenger pigeon, a gray bird with a red breast, once common all over North America and, which had gone extinct in early 1900s. Scientists believe that due to technological progress, the chances of such de-extinction, so to say, are high, so the question is not “if,” but rather “when” this will be done. Both of these species were functionally unique species strongly affecting their environments, so their vanishing had changed the ecosystems they lived in as well. George Church, the lead researcher working on the resurrection of a mammoth in Harvard University, believes these precursors of modern elephants would help turn the modern Arctic tundra back to grasslands: mammoths used to contribute to grasslands’ spreading by knocking down trees and spreading grass seeds in their dung. In their turn, the passenger pigeons were extremely important for the forests they lived in as well (ScienceMag). Reviving these two species will likely solve a number of ecological problems in an effective and quick way.\n\nAs it can be see, mass extinction is not something that had never happened before on Earth. Currently, we are witnessing the sixth mass extinction, with the main difference being the human factor greatly contributing to species’ disappearance. There are ways, however, to slow down or even turn back the processes of extinction; one of them, the more traditional one, is the reintroduction of cage-bred species to their natural environments. The other more advanced one involves the most recent advancements in genetics, and will probably allow scientists to resurrect animals believed to have gone extinct forever. Thus, there is still hope for planet Earth.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of geothermal energy?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The debates around renewable sources of energy have been going on at least a decade. After more than a century of relying on fossil fuels almost entirely, changing this paradigm in favor of the renewable energy sources may seem difficult and unjustified for some people. However, the situation when fossil fuel was the most efficient and the cheapest source of energy has been left far in the past; nowadays, it is obvious that using oil or gas is not only expensive, but also causes tremendous damage to the planet we live on. Many countries such as Germany or Sweden have already made significant efforts to fix this situation, employing numerous power plants working on the renewable sources of energy; the most effective among these sources is geothermal energy. Using it has a number of benefits which should be considered by governments globally.\n\nGeothermal energy—and in particular, the prices of it—does not depend on the world’s economic and political situation as strongly as fossil fuels do. Besides, extracting and transporting fossil fuel adds up to the price of energy produced from it. In its turn, geothermal energy is much cheaper than conventional ones, involving low-running costs and saving up to 80% of costs over fossil fuels (CEF).\n\nEnvironmental friendliness is another benefit of geothermal energy. Being a renewable source, it definitely produces less waste and pollution than conventional energy sources; the exact indexes, however, depend on the systems used for producing geothermal energy. In open-loop geothermal systems, carbon dioxide makes up about 10% of air emissions; an even smaller percentage of emissions is methane. Overall, open-loop geothermal systems produce 0.1 pounds of carbon dioxide and other harmful gases per kilowatt-hour of the energy produced. In closed-loop systems, the greenhouse gases are not released into the atmosphere, although a relatively small amount of such emissions can be produced during a geothermal power plant’s construction. For a comparison, a power plant producing electricity from gas releases up to 2 pounds of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour into the atmosphere, and those power plants that work on coal produce an astonishing 3.6 pounds of greenhouse gases per kilowatt-hour of energy produced. As it can be seen, even less advanced open-loop geothermal systems are much cleaner and safer for ecology than the power plants working on conventional energy sources (UCS).\n\nLow maintenance costs make yet another reason why using geothermal power plants should be a priority for many countries. Geothermal heat pump systems require 25% to 50% less energy for work compared to the conventional systems for heating or cooling. Besides, geothermal equipment is less bulky, so it requires less space: due to the very nature of geothermal energy (which is extracted from the bowels of the planet), geothermal power plants have only a few moving parts, all of which can be easily sheltered inside a relatively small building. This is not to mention that the life span of geothermal equipment is rather long: up to 50 years for pipes, and up to 20 years for pumps (GreenMatch). All this makes geothermal power stations easy to build and maintain.\n\nAs it can be seen, using geothermal energy is more effective than energy produced from conventional sources of energy. Geothermal energy is cheaper, less harmful for the environment, and power plants producing it are easier to build and maintain. These factors make geothermal energy a reasonable and effective alternative to energy produced from fossil fuels, so the governments of the world should consider converting their industries to work on geothermal energy.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the underlying causes of infidelity?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Love in all of its manifestations has been the most caroled of subjects. Countless poets, writers, artists, and common people dedicated their entire lives searching for it and expressing it. And, as long as love exists, so do the dramas almost necessarily surrounding this emotion: ancient Greek epics, Shakespeare’s plays, Giuseppe Verdi’s operas, and other sources can provide one with multiple illustrations of this statement. One of the most significant dramas connected to love and romantic relationships is infidelity (let us recall Shakespeare’s Othello). Infidelity, more commonly known as cheating, is a catastrophe for countless couples, married or not, around the world, and is looked down upon based on almost any society’s moral foundation. But could it be that infidelity does not mean falling out of love with one’s significant other, as it is usually claimed? Is it always a voluntary choice? Does it necessarily lead to divorce? Let us try to find out the answers.\n\nPerhaps the most frequent question spouses ask their partners that cheated on them is, “Why?” This is an important question indeed. Recent brain research revealed that one of the factors contributing to infidelity might originate from neurology, specifically from neural architecture. All people have brain centers responsible for sex drive, romance, and attachment to a partner. These centers are respectively responsible for the motivation to seek a possible partner for copulation (sex drive); to save an individual’s metabolic energy and time by focusing one’s courtship efforts on the best possible partner (romantic aspect); and to stay with the chosen partner long enough to raise at least one child, or longer (attachment). Interactions between these three centers define our behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and motives when we are in love. Logically, if the balance of influences these centers have on each other shifts towards one of them—specifically, the “sex drive” one—a person might be more prone to seek sexual relationships with more partners than just one (and this does not mean this person does not still love their “primary” partner). As if it was not enough, in 2008, scientists discovered that there could be a gene directly connected to infidelity and pair-bonding behavior. During an experiment, 552 married or co-habiting couples were examined; men carrying the 334 vasopressin allele in a specific region of the vasopressin system demonstrated lesser attachment to their partners, were less satisfied with their marriage, and tended to experience more marital crisis than those who did not bear the allele (TED).\n\nThis does not mean infidelity can be explained by genetics or neurology alone; neither does it means only men are prone to cheating. It rather implies that when figuring out the factors causing infidelity, biological reasons should not be neglected.\n\nApart from the biological reasons, social—or, more specifically, financial—reasons can also draw people into cheating their partners. According to Christin L. Munsch, PhD, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, some people could be cheating because of being economically dependent on their partners. In her research published in 2015 in the American Sociological Review, she states that men who are economically dependent on their partners tend to cheat more often than those who can sustain themselves. The same is true for women, although men tend to do it more often (there is a 15% chance of a man cheating due to an economic factor, versus only 5% of women). “We naturally compare ourselves to see how we stack up and don’t want to feel like we are on the losing end of the comparison […] Men are supposed to be breadwinners, and although women may not like being dependent on a man, nobody is questioning her femininity as a result,” Dr. Munsch says. As a result, a man feels the urge to “prove themselves” in other possible ways more often than women. “Men engage in compensatory hyper-masculine behavior such as cheating, which also allows him to punish the breadwinning spouse” (Everyday Health).\n\nSeemingly higher proneness of men to infidelity does not mean, however, that those of them who cheat are necessarily unhappy in their marriages. According to a study by Rutgers University, 56% of men who cheated on their spouses claimed to be happy with their marriages; 34% of cheating women stated the same. Moreover, when a spouse cheated on becomes aware of infidelity, it does not automatically lead to divorce—or, at least, this is not the major cause of many divorces, being only the second reason after falling out of love. “A single instance of infidelity may not lead to divorce, especially if the couple uses it as a wake-up call and fix the underlying problems. It is the repeated instances of cheating that usually lead to divorce,” Dr. Tina B. Tessina, a psychotherapist in California, says (Medical Daily).\n\nAs it can be seen, infidelity is not just a caprice or fully conscious voluntary choice. It is rather a result of an interaction of multiple underlying factors: genetics, neurology, social, and financial status, and so on. The good news is that infidelity does not lead to divorce if a couple wants to work it out. The fact of cheating can be a wake up call for many couples to work on their relationships and improve them—especially considering that even those men and women who cheat on their partners do love them in a significant number of cases.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the causes and effects of road rage?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Considering the ever-increasing pace of life across the globe, possessing a car and being able to drive one has become a necessity. The number of car owners grows exponentially each year, and unfortunately, so does the amount of deaths and injuries related to driving. However, not all of these accidents are regular car crashes; a significant percentage of cases when drivers get hurt or die is caused by a phenomenon widely known as road rage.\n\nThis term appeared in California, USA, in the 1980s, to describe a series of shootings that occurred on the freeways of Los Angeles. Perhaps, the most suitable definition for this phenomenon is a driver’s loss of emotional control and\/or stability caused by traffic events, and leading to this driver’s deviant or offensive behavior: aggressive driving, verbal and\/or gesture abuse, physical attacks, and even gunfire. Apparently, those incidents were not isolated, and road rage gradually turned into one of the biggest driving problems in the United States; during the period between 1990-1996, there was a 51% increase of road rage incidents. In 2007, because of road rage attacks on construction workers, Highway 138 in Los Angeles was closed, and in 2012, there was a mass fistfight near Los Angeles downtown. It is considered that road rage can be linked to at least 218 deaths by murder (and this number increases annually at a rate of 7% each year); also, it is considered that at least 66% of recent traffic fatalities can be linked to aggressive driving, 37% percent of them being cases of gunfire (Elite Driving School).\n\nPsychiatrists believe some drivers can be more prone to developing road rage than others. Usually, people who tend to fall into this condition are relatively young (in their late 20s or in the middle of 30s), male, and possibly suffering from a psychological condition called IED—intermittent emotional disorder. This condition can be generally characterized by sudden outbursts of anger accompanied by a decreased ability to control it, and to refrain from releasing it upon others. The factors responsible for such a behavior can be different, starting from chronic stress, and ending up with an intense emotional condition, such as losing a job or an important person (Traffic School).\n\nLos Angeles is not the only city in the United States subject to road rage; Phoenix, Miami, Boston, New York, as well as many other big cities across the whole 50 states are on the list too), but it is because of such cases the state of California decided to turn road rage into a legal term, and treat those who succumb to it respectively (Traffic School). Road rage is rather often confused with aggressive driving, and although the latter can be the “symptom” of road rage, the first one is a more complex phenomenon. “Legally, road rage is not recognized in most states,” says Dr. Leon James, professor of Psychology at the University of Hawaii. “There are some laws that have been enacted by about 20 states on ‘aggressive driving.’ Still, the majority of states have no laws that mention either road rage or aggressive driving and prefer to handle driving enforcement through existing laws that specify violations.” According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), “Aggressive driving is a traffic offense; road rage is a criminal offense.” The NHTSA defines aggressive driving as occurring when “an individual commits a combination of moving traffic offenses so as to endanger other persons or property,” whereas road rage is “an assault with a motor vehicle or other dangerous weapon by the operator or passenger(s) of another motor vehicle or an assault precipitated by an incident that occurred on a roadway” (South Source).\n\nIf you have found yourself in a situation when another driver started behaving aggressively towards you, the optimal reaction would be to avoid direct eye contact and not behave aggressively in response, regardless of whether it was your fault causing road rage or not (SafeMotorist.com). This might seem a bit self-humiliating, as a refusal to stand for your own rights and dignity, but you should remember that drivers with road rage sometimes cannot handle their anger, and if they have firearms or other weapons with them, the situation might turn fatal.\n\nAs it can be seen, road rage is a rather widespread phenomenon on the roads of the United States. First noticed by media in the late 1980s, it quickly became one of the main traffic problems in the United States. In some states—California, for example—road rage is already treated as a crime. Drivers subject to road rage are usually young, and suffer from IED, which can cause them to behave uncontrollably. Therefore, the best tactics against such a driver would be to avoid eye contact and not to respond with aggression towards their behavior.###"}
{"prompt":"How did William Delisle Hay's novella The Doom of the Great City foreshadow our current environmental problems?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This article [Bad Air: Pollution, Sin, and Science Fiction in William Delisle Hay’s The Doom of the Great City (1880)] was originally published in The Public Domain Review [http:\/\/publicdomainreview.org\/2015\/09\/30\/bad-air-pollution-sin-and-science-fiction\/] under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0. If you wish to reuse it please see: http:\/\/publicdomainreview.org\/legal\/\n\nBy Brett Beasley\n\nScarcely can I pourtray in words the dire and dismal scenes that met my vision here… For here, where on the previous night had throbbed hot and high the flood-tide of London’s evening gaiety, was now presented to my poor fevered sight, the worst, the most awful features of the whole terrific calamity. I had entered into the very heart and home of horror itself.\n\nThis is the way the world ends: not with a bang, but a bronchial spasm. That is, at least, according to William Delisle Hay’s 1880 novella The Doom of the Great City. It imagines the entire population of London choked to death under a soot-filled fog. The story is told by the event’s lone survivor sixty years later as he recalls “the greatest calamity that perhaps this earth has ever witnessed” at what was, for Hay’s first readers, the distant future date of 1942.\n\nThe novella received only mild acclaim among its late Victorian readers, and today it is almost forgotten. But, surprisingly enough, it has become possible to read our social and environmental problems foretold in Hay’s strange little story. In our age of global warming, acid rain, and atmospheric pollution, we may become the first readers to take Hay seriously. When Hay imagines a city whose wealth and “false social system” lulls it into complacency, we can recognize ourselves in his words. And as for those air problems that loomed dangerously around them, Londoners “looked upon them in the light of a regular institution, not caring to investigate their cause with a view to some means of mitigating them.” At moments like these, we get the feeling that Hay’s obscure 135-year-old story is eerily prophetic.\n\nBut before we canonize Hay as an environmentalist and his story as An Inconvenient Truth in Victorian garb, we have to look at the story’s other features. Readers of The Doom of the Great City unfailingly notice that the story does not fit easily with other science fiction narratives, but seems to belong also to another class of tales, which Brian Stableford has called “ringing accounts of richly deserved punishment.” This is because Hay’s narrator seems to slide back and forth between material and moral explanations for pollution. While he talks of how “In those latter days there had been past years of terribly bad weather, destroying harvests,” he adds in the same paragraph, “prostitution flourished rampantly, while Chastity laid down her head and died! Evil!—one seemed to see it everywhere!”\n\nIn fact, the narrator goes so far as to cast himself as a prophet. Like a latterday Jeremiah, he reviles London as “foul and rotten to the very core, and steeped in sin of every imaginable variety.” In a twenty-page diatribe, he catalogs vices such as prodigality, corruption, avarice, and aestheticism—not to mention feminine vanity, for which he reserves special scorn. He denounces tradesmen, aristocrats, theater-goers, and the young as well as the old. For him, London is like Atlantis or Babylon standing blithely unaware of the divine wrath about to strike it.\n\nAll of this raises an important question: can pollution be material (i.e. made of soot, ashes, smoke, chemicals, etc.) and moral as well? The same question could also be stated as a problem of genre. What exactly are we reading when we read The Doom of the Great City? Is it a forward-looking science-fiction tale about a dystopian future that may yet arrive? Or is it a fantasy of divine retribution that belongs with the ancient past?\n\nIn order to answer that question, we need a working definition of science fiction. For that definition, we could look to Rod Serling’s statement that science fiction is “the improbable made possible.” Hay certainly draws from available scientific ideas to make his improbable story into a reasonable possibility. Hay’s contemporary F.A.R. Russell consistently noted higher instances of death from asthma and respiratory complaints during intense fogs, and he published widely in an effort to raise public concern about them. But Hay’s literary precursors (like the public in general) tended to see the fog as a mere nuisance. They could even at times show some fanciful tenderness toward it as toward an ugly pet that would not go away. For example, William Guppy in Dickens’ 1853 novel Bleak House describes the fog in familiar terms as “The London Particular.” But Hay makes that seemingly friendly pet bite—and, increasingly, the data was on his side.\n\nIn addition to the evidence of news and anecdotes, Hay needed a plausible cause of death, not just for the infirm, but for an entire metropolitan population. That is where the “bronchial spasm” comes in. Hay, a published scientist (specifically a mycologist) is scrupulous on this point. On the chance journey into the country that saves his life, Hay’s protagonist discusses the fog with a friend who also happens to be a leading medical authority, one Wilton Forrester. Forrester gives “the benefit of his scientific acquirements,” by laying out what he considers to be the only possible scenario in which a fog can prove fatal. He explains that in a case he previously observed:\n\nThe bronchi and tubes ramifying from them were clogged with black, grimy mucus, and death had evidently resulted from a sudden spasm, which would produce suffocation, as the lungs would not have the power in their clogged condition of making a sufficiently forcible expiatory effort to get rid of the accumulated filth that was the instrument of death.###"}

{"prompt":"How did voting fraud and media misrepresentation affect Bernie Sanders' campaign in the 2016 US presidential primary election?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In the 2016 US presidential primary election, the most revolutionary figure had been Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran as a democrat, though he identified himself as a “democratic socialist.” He charged the youth base with fanatic energy and gave the future of the US a bright hope for countless individuals who leaned towards the left in politics, wanting less wars and more social programs. He promised free college education, free medical care, and a $15 minimum wage by siphoning tax dollars that go to the military and other areas he deemed were being overspent on. However, through the mishandling of the vote counting in the primary election, a lack of attention by the US media, and a misrepresentation of delegate numbers by the US media, Sanders came up short on being the US democratic presidential nominee against rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe most startling example of voting corruption of 2016 was during the New York democratic primary vote. In this particular state primary, only registered democrats could vote for democrats. For seemingly unknown reasons, thousands of voters were purged from the system before the day of the primary vote, leaving countless Sanders supporters unable to vote (Anonymous, Massive Clinton Voter Fraud in New York). Also, in Sanders’ hometown of Brooklyn, many voting machines did not work (Atkin 2016). Hillary Clinton had been known to do such tricks before in the election, with the help of Democratic National Convention officials. For instance, during the Arizona primary election, where voting was suppressed on voting day, Clinton garnered an almost insurmountable lead from early mail-in votes from her target demographic (Anonymous, Arizona: Hillary Clinton’s Election Fraud Exposed).\n\nThere was a study by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy about how Sanders was ignored by the media and how it affected his campaign:\n\nBy summer, Sanders had emerged as Clinton’s leading competitor but, even then, his coverage lagged. Not until the pre-primary debates did his coverage begin to pick up, though not at a rate close to what he needed to compensate for the early part of the year. Five Republican contenders—Trump, Bush, Cruz, Rubio, and Carson—each had more news coverage than Sanders during the invisible primary. Clinton got three times more coverage than he did.\n\n(Bertrand 2016)\n\nThis points to a clear bias by the mainstream media when they reported on Sanders. Since the media’s job is to report objectively without leaning to one side, it can be said the media violated the US public’s trust. With less coverage, Sanders appeared to be a lesser candidate than Clinton. Psychology weighs a lot upon the minds of voters in primary and general elections.\n\nThe misrepresentation of Sanders by the media did not help his cause, either. Throughout his campaign, the media reported that Clinton’s delegate count was much higher than it was, as they counted superdelegates with the elected delegates given by regular citizens. Superdelegates are government officials and their votes are not supposed to be counted until the Democratic National Convention in July. Despite this, the media by and large counted superdelegates who voiced their support for both candidates into their reporting well before the Convention. Clinton had many more superdelegates willing to vote for her, as she was the establishment candidate, and Sanders was the fringe candidate that joined the democratic party for the election (being an Independent before) (LeftofYou 2016).\n\nPolitics in the US in general is corrupt, but the 2016 primary race for US president was one of the most accurately and thoroughly documented political races in US history—resulting in fine documentation of that corruption. Though Bernie Sanders had an enormous surge in popularity, with thousands of people visiting his rallies—much more than Hillary Clinton’s rallies—Sanders was largely ignored by the media, was dealt blows in terms of voting numbers due to voting fraud and system mishandling, and by delegate numbers being misrepresented by the press. If it were not for these three ordeals, Sanders might have been the 2016 Democratic nominee for US president, and most likely the 45th president of the US.###"}
{"prompt":"What was the purpose of John Comenius' Orbis Sensualium Pictus?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This article [In the Image of God: John Comenius and the First Children’s Picture Book] was originally published in The Public Domain Review [http:\/\/publicdomainreview.org\/2014\/05\/14\/in-the-image-of-god-john-comenius-and-the-first-childrens-picture-book\/] under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0. If you wish to reuse it please see: http:\/\/publicdomainreview.org\/legal\n\nBy Charles McNamara\n\nJohn Comenius’ Orbis Sensualium Pictus (or The World of Things Obvious to the Senses Drawn in Pictures) is, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica, “the first children’s picture book.” Originally published in 1658 in Latin and German, the Orbis—with its 150 pictures showing everyday activities like brewing beer, tending gardens, and slaughtering animals—is immediately familiar as an ancestor of today’s children’s literature. This approach centered on the visual was a breakthrough in education for the young, as was the decision to teach the vernacular in addition to Latin. Unlike treatises on education and grammatical handbooks, it is aimed directly at the young and attempts to engage on their level.\n\nThe Orbis was hugely popular. At one point, it was the most used textbook in Europe for elementary education, and according to one account, it was translated into “most European and some of the Oriental languages.” Its author John Comenius, a Czech by birth, was also well-known throughout Europe and worked in several countries as a school reformer. His portrait was painted by Rembrandt, and according to an 1887 edition of the Orbis, Comenius was even “once solicited to become President of Harvard College” (although he never came to Harvard, one can still find his name engraved on the western frieze of Teachers College at Columbia University). Even if he is less celebrated today by name, his innovative ideas about education are still influential. In his Didactica Magna, for example, he advocates for equal educational opportunities for all: boys and girls, rich and poor, urban and rural.\n\nDespite his progressive aims and lasting educational influence, Comenius does not come off as a thoroughly modern schoolmaster. When we turn to the first page of the Orbis, we find an opening sentence that would seem peculiar in today’s children’s books: “Come, boy, learn to be wise.” We see above the text a teacher and student in dialog, the former holding up his finger and sporting a cane and large hat, the latter listening in an emotional state somewhere between awe and anxiety. The student asks, “What doth this mean, to be wise?” His teacher answers, “To understand rightly, to do rightly, and to speak out rightly all that are necessary.”\n\nThe first chapter of the Orbis looks to the third of these goals in what reads like an early version of “Old MacDonald Had a Farm.” Children learn how “to speak out rightly” by imitating animal noises. These two pages are a trove of Latin onomatopoetic verbs and peculiar renderings of animal sounds: cats cry out “nau nau” instead of “meow meow,” and we learn that “the Duck quacketh” (anas tetrinnit), “the Hare squeaketh” (lapus vagit), and “the Crow crieth” (cornix cornicatur). This introduction to animal noises is familiar territory for modern educational toys, as any trip to Toys R’ Us confirms. The teacher explains that first the student must learn “the plain sounds…which living creatures know how to make, and thy tongue knoweth how to imitate.” After mastering these noises, the student and teacher “will go into the World, and we will view all things.”\n\nBut after learning how to quack and how to squeak, the children do not “go into the World,” and they do not actually view anything either. Instead, the Orbis abruptly shifts to the philosophical and the invisible, perhaps hoping that a firm grasp of ducks and mice is sufficient for understanding the divine. Chapter 2 presents children with a crash course in theological metaphysics, where they learn that God is “in his Essence Spiritual, and One. In his personality, Three.” They learn that He is “A Light inaccessible; and yet all in all. Every where and no where.” Even if the Orbis is devoted to showing the world visually, its discussion of God is abstract and opaque. And the illustration for this chapter is nothing like the bearded old man we see on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. It is instead a complex diagram, faceless and geometric. So much for the goal of showing “The World of Things Obvious to the Senses.”\n\nComenius reveals the rationale for this lesson at its end, where he calls God “the Creator, so the Governor and Preserver of all things, which we call the World (Mundum).” Only after introducing God can the author describe His creations: “The World” (Mundus), “The Heaven” (Caelum), the four elements, plants, and animals. In fact, the Orbis loosely mimics the order of creation found at the beginning of Genesis. Comenius expands upon the sparse Biblical narrative with colorful examples of fauna. We learn about a staggering variety of exotic animals: there are six chapters on birds (“Water-Fowl” (Aves Aquaticae), “Ravenous Birds” (Aves Rapaces), among others) and a chapter on “Flying Vermin” (Insecta Volantia), including mentions of the “Gad-Bee” (Oestrum) and the “Glow-worm” (Cicindela).\n\nAfter thirty-five chapters on theology, elements, plants, and animals, Comenius finally introduces humans. He again opts for the Biblical account and addresses Adam and Eve before more immediate topics like “The Outward Parts of a Man,” where we learn that women have “two Dugs, with Nipples” and that below the stomach, we find “the Groyn and the privities.” The anatomical terminology is vast, including words for each finger and for a number of bones in the body. But amid instruction on the corporeal and familiar, Comenius again injects the abstract and invisible into his picture book with Chapter 43, a discussion of “The Soul of Man.” A dotted outline of a human, opening his arms as if to welcome the students’ gaze, stands at the top of the page. Despite this illustration, Comenius’ discussion of the soul is not dumbed down for children. He lays out the categories of souls for his young students: the “Vegetative” soul of plants, the “Sensitive” soul of animals, and the “Rational” souls of humans.\n\nOther chapters address more mundane topics. Comenius discusses deformed people (“the blubber-lipped” and “the steeple-crowned” among others) and a variety of basic commercial practices including but not limited to honey-making, beer-brewing, bread-baking, shoe-cobbling, and box-making. The later chapters of the book concentrate on the activities of learned elites, fitting for our student who has passed from the earliest stages of imitating animal noises through lessons on the human soul. Comenius includes chapters on music, philosophy, astronomy, and a number of virtues like temperance and fortitude. And a student who has progressed so far in his studies perhaps has earned a little free time, so the Orbis introduces him to tennis, dice games, and fencing.\n\nTo parallel his first chapter on God and the Trinity, Comenius concludes the Orbis with an extensive discussion of theology and religion, beginning in Chapter 144. Comenius’ allegiances are clear: he devotes one page of text to “Gentilism,” about one page to Judaism, but over two full pages to Christianity (he also includes a half-page on “Mahometism”). Appropriately, Comenius’ final topic is The Last Judgment, where “the last day…shall raise up the Dead with the sound of a Trumpet” and when “the Godly & Elect, shall enter into life eternal into the place of Bliss.” It seems that as much as the student must learn how God created the world, he must also learn how God will end it.\n\nThe final page, mirroring the first, again shows the teacher speaking and the young student listening attentively. But in his second appearance, the student says nothing: we might say Comenius’ lesson was not a matter of dialog and discussion but of assiduous memorization. The teacher, too, seems to have changed his approach. He tells the student, “thou hast seen in short, all things that can be shewed,” but he recommends that the student also “read other good Books diligently” so that he may become “learned, wise, and godly.”\n\nPerhaps, then, Comenius’ project was a clever ruse all along. Recognizing that his students would never learn theology from looking at trees and birds, he wrote the Orbis, his own “good Book” where children could learn their metaphysics and Biblical basics. Even if the first page of the book urges the student to become “wise” and promises to “shew thee all,” the final page concedes that such wisdom does not come from mere sights and sounds. Comenius, in fact, finishes the book with an admonition not to go out into the world at all. A student should instead learn to “fear God, and call upon him, that he may bestow upon thee the Spirit of Wisdom.”###"}
{"prompt":"How did Georg Trakl's cocaine use contribute to his death?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" This article [Wild Heart Turning White: Georg Trakl and Cocaine] was originally published in The Public Domain Review [http:\/\/publicdomainreview.org\/2014\/10\/29\/wild-heart-turning-white-georg-trakl-and-cocaine\/] under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0. If you wish to reuse it please see: http:\/\/publicdomainreview.org\/legal\/\n\nBy Richard Millington\n\nThis remark is taken from the medical file of Georg Trakl and is part of a brief account of the poet’s movements and behavior in the month or so preceding his committal for observation to a psychiatric hospital in Kraków in early October 1914. Just six weeks earlier, towards the end of August, the 27-year-old Trakl had undertaken the 1000-kilometer train journey from Innsbruck, at the western end of the Habsburg Empire, to the far eastern crownland of Galicia, where he was to be deployed as a military pharmacist. His frontline experience was brief but traumatic. During the Battle of Grodek-Rawa Ruska of September 8-11, he was assigned sole care of ninety badly wounded soldiers sheltering in a barn, a task for which he had neither the training nor the equipment. As he later recounted from his hospital bed in Kraków to his friend and publisher Ludwig von Ficker, when one of the wounded men had ended his own suffering by shooting himself in the head, Trakl had fled outside only to be confronted by the sight of local peasants hanging lifeless in the trees. One evening during the westward retreat of the defeated Austro-Hungarian forces, he announced his own intention to shoot himself, but was forcefully disarmed by his comrades. His committal followed on October 6, and he died in a hospital on November 3. His medical file lists the cause of death, complete withan exclamation mark, as “Suicid durch Cocainintoxication!”\n\nWhen news of Trakl’s death on the Russian front reached intellectual celebrity Karl Kraus in Vienna, Kraus reacted by claiming that the poet was “hardly a victim of war. It was always incomprehensible to me that he could live at all. His insanity wrestled with godly things.” In the light of what we now know about Trakl’s final months, it is fair to conclude that Kraus underestimated the role that the war played in his demise: there are indeed compelling reasons to number him among its many victims. Yet the enduring value of Kraus’s assessment is that it draws attention to the importance of other factors that made Trakl’s hold on life so tenuous even before first-hand experience of armed conflict precipitated his final crisis. His war story is neither one of the destruction of innocence nor of the betrayal of naïve faith, but rather of the exacerbation of existing vulnerability. What, then, are we to make of Kraus’s assertion that Trakl’s “insanity wrestled with godly things?” First and foremost, the poet’s readers are likely to associate this statement with his dark, exquisite, often enigmatic verse, once characterized by Ludwig Wittgenstein as “beautiful yet incomprehensible” and as possessing “the tone of true genius.” Rainer Maria Rilke was similarly startled by its other-worldly quality, comparing the act of reading his younger compatriot’s second published collection Sebastian in Dream (1915) to being “pressed against panes of glass: for Trakl’s experience occurs like mirror images and fills its entire space, which, like the space in the mirror, cannot be entered.”\n\nUnlike Wittgenstein and Rilke, however, Kraus knew Trakl personally, even having holidayed with him for ten days in Venice in August 1913, and when he expressed amazement at the poet’s ability to “live at all,” he was probably thinking less of his poetry than of his personality. Many aspects of Trakl’s biography point to chronic maladjustment. This is reflected to varying degrees in his inability to hold down a regular job, his sometimes eccentric behavior, his tendency to brooding and melancholy, his habitual identification with abject figures (such as Germany’s best-known feral child Kaspar Hauser), his suspiciously close attachment to his younger sister Grete, and last but not least his drug and alcohol abuse. Trakl’s partiality for “dark poisons,” as he would call them in several late poems, embodied a self-destructive tendency that at a basic, physiological level certainly did more than anything else to render his earthly existence so precarious. “A heavy drinker and drug-eater” is the characterization offered by Ficker—a man by no means given to cheap sensationalizing, least of all in matters concerning his brilliant protégé. From the perspective of Trakl’s wider biography, the cocaine overdose that killed him appears as the culminating act in an unrelenting process of self-poisoning that loomed large over his brief adult life.\n\nDocumentary evidence of Trakl’s cocaine use is restricted to the notes in his medical file and therefore to the ten-week period of his active military service in Galicia and hospitalization in Kraków. It is probable, however, that he had at least tried cocaine before, as this was in common medicinal use in the years before the First World War. Ease of access to the full range of available pharmaceuticals was one of several advantages presented by Trakl’s decision to pursue pharmacy as a respectable and gainful career to complement his literary endeavors. He took his first steps along this path immediately after leaving school in autumn 1905, starting with a three-year apprenticeship at a local chemist’s shop in his native Salzburg, followed by two years of pharmacy study in the imperial capital Vienna. Trakl’s letters suggest that his two intoxicants of preference during the pre-war years were alcohol and Veronal (the first barbiturate to be marketed for medicinal purposes), but he is known to have used a wide range of substances, and clearly the imperative to achieve intoxication in any form was more important for him than particular effects associated with individual substances.\n\nReady availability was probably an important reason for Trakl’s choice of cocaine while on active service in Galicia. First isolated from Andean coca leaves by Friedrich Gaedcke in 1855, in the final decades of the nineteenth century, the cocaine alkaloid had been extolled as something of a wonder drug, most enthusiastically by none other than the young Sigmund Freud. Popular tonics such as Vin Mariani and Coca-Cola had made its stimulant effects available to a wide consumer base throughout Europe and North America. Among its numerous medical applications, its local anaesthetic properties had the most profound and lasting impact, so much so that the suffix –caine subsequently became standard in naming synthetic substances with similar properties. An exponential increase in the need for anesthetics explains the accelerated production and geographical diffusion of cocaine during the First World War. As Hans Maier explains in his 1926 study Der Kokainismus, the main European source of the drug at this time was the German pharmaceutical industry. Whereas recreational use had previously been restricted mostly to major urban centers, the war made cocaine relatively easy to obtain in places as remote, for example, as the Galician countryside to which Trakl’s unit was posted, or for that matter the small Russian village in which Mikhail Bulgakov’s story “Morphine” is set (“Morphine” tells the story of a young doctor who unsuccessfully attempts to cure his morphine addiction by replacing morphine with cocaine and is based on Bulgakov’s own experience of the years 1917-18 in the province of Smolensk). In the aftermath of the war, as Maier notes, the chaotic distribution of army stocks aided the huge rise in the popularity of cocaine that saw it become a “champagne drug” among European socialites during the roaring twenties.\n\nIn contrast to his medical file, Trakl’s poetry contains no obvious traces of the heavy cocaine use of his final months—or indeed of any earlier, undocumented use. In this respect, it differs from the literary work of his German contemporary Gottfried Benn, a doctor specializing in skin and venereal diseases who between 1915 and 1917 was stationed at a hospital for prostitutes in occupied Brussels. Benn’s cocaine experiments of his Brussels period have a clear literary correlative in several poems and dramatic scenes celebrating the euphoria and vitality associated with cocaine intoxication. Trakl’s reticence about cocaine is consistent with a broader pattern in his poetic treatment of intoxicants. Other terms excluded from his poetic lexicon despite denoting substances he is known to have consumed in considerable quantities include alcohol, beer, schnapps, chloroform, barbiturate, Veronal, morphine, and opium. Of themselves, these omissions might appear unremarkable. Like the Polish Modernist Witkacy, who signed many paintings not with his own initials, but with those of the drugs he had consumed while producing them, poets of the post-Romantic age might sometimes choose to insert factual or fictional records of self-medication into their works as tools of self-stylization, but there is no expectation for them to do so. Yet in Trakl’s case, these omissions become significant because of the apparent contradiction they present to the overall prominence within his poetry of psychoactive substances and their effects.###"}
{"prompt":"What were the reasons that the United States decided to enter World War I?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The beginning of the 21st century was stained with one of the most tragic events in human history: the First World War. Although it started and occurred in Europe, the United States actively participated in it. Some people say that due to its geographical location, America could have had ignored WWI; however, it is not so. There were several objective reasons for the United States to become one of the conflicting parties.\n\nAt the very beginning of WW1, Woodrow Wilson, who was the President of the United States at the time, declared his country’s neutrality in the War, supported by the majority of the American people. At the same time, the United States’ most important trade partner, Great Britain, had been harassed by Germany: the latter tried to isolate Britain from its allies and trade partners. This led to the worsening of diplomatic relationships between Kaiser’s Germany and the United States (History.com). Germany had also declared its aggressive intentions against any ship that would enter the combat zone around Britain (History Lists). Such politics led to the second reason that made the United States refute its neutrality and enter the War.\n\nIn 1915, a German submarine torpedoed a British civil ship “Lusitania” travelling nearby the Irish shores. It was a horrible tragedy with more than 1,000 civilians killed in cold blood; among the victims of “Lusitania” there were 128 Americans. The public outcry in the United States was caused not only by this fact, but also by the German submarine not warning civilians on the ship about their intention to sink it; the incident with “Lusitania” had greatly influenced the anti-German mood in the United States. Germany promised to stop such warfare, but within less than a year, its forces had sunk yet another civilian ship: the ferry called “Sussex.” And again, this was not the last time a passenger ship had been destroyed (History Lists).\n\nAs if it was not enough, it turned out that Germany tried to “bribe” the Mexican government and lure it into its coalition. In 1917, British intelligence had deciphered a telegram sent by the German Minister of foreign affairs, Arthur Zimmermann, to the German ambassador in Mexico City. In this telegram, the minister promised that Germany would help Mexico return the territories lost by the latter during the Mexican-American War in exchange for the Mexican support in war. British intelligence sent the telegram to President Wilson on February 24, thus creating one more reason for the United States to enter WW1 (Office of the Historian).\n\nAs it can be seen, the reasons why the US decided to join the war were significant. Although the United States initially proclaimed its neutrality, the constant German harassment of America’s main trade partner, Great Britain, the sinking of numerous civilian ships (resulting in the deaths of American citizens, in particular), and a cunning attempt of German-Mexican alliance had forced the United States to enter WW1.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the metaphors used by Andreas Vesalius in his anatomy text, De Humani Corporis Fabrica?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Andreas Vesalius threw down a glove in front of established medicine and its scholars when, in 1543, he produced a massive anatomy text titled De Humani Corporis Fabrica on the fabric of the human body.\n\nVesalius believed that the field of medicine was being ill served by sending its students to books to learn their anatomy. The flesh itself had to teach, not merely the page. This idea of hands-on learning trumping an ancient textual legacy was an affront to many of Vesalius’ medical peers. Medicine was not a handicraft, but a noble scholastic art. Far from trying to disparage his discipline, Vesalius intended to elevate the most denigrated field of medicine—surgery—to that same level of esteem. He was taking a professional risk. But the Fabrica, the result of untold hours of dissection and writing, largely spoke persuasively for itself. Vesalius exposed hundreds of mistakes made by Galen, whose writings were still considered the chief source on anatomy over a thousand years after they had been written.\n\nNaturally, there were some who still believed that Vesalius had misunderstood what he had seen in his dissections, or Galen’s explanation itself. But the stance the Fabrica and its author took gained attention, and the idea of an apprenticeship in anatomy at the slab, rather than the desk, began to gain ground.\n\nStill, opportunities for students to  observe dissections were rarer than Vesalius would like, and could never fill the need of a student or professional to occasionally fact-check their memory, or consult a confusing realm of the body in more depth at their leisure. The Fabrica‘s illustrations were a small effort to reproduce, for the study, the complexity that would confront the anatomy student in the anatomy theater. The resulting woodcut illustrations, beautiful works prepared at Vesalius’ own expense in Titian’s Venetian workshop, have become the centerpiece of the Fabrica’s lasting impression.\n\nBut it is telling that Vesalius had his Latin text published in German only days afterward. The Fabrica was meant to be read, and read again—not merely looked at. This was all the more true for the students of anatomy Vesalius wanted to reach out to, who would be buying abbreviated versions of the massive text, without nearly as many (if any) expensive illustrations reproduced inside. And furthermore, two-dimensional images could never properly convey the constant movement and form of a three-dimensional body. Vesalius had to, as best as he was able, paint a moving mental picture with words that would be good enough for surgeons to use as guidance when they lowered their blade into the flesh of their patients.\n\nTo draw the reader’s mind toward a mental model of the body’s inner workings, Vesalius used his full toolkit of pedagogic devices. Metaphor and analogy, especially, could be used to help the student make the cognitive leap to understanding the alien. Now, these metaphors show us the ways in which anatomists might visualize and understand the structures, dynamic processes, and physical motions of the body. While he broke with tradition in many ways, Vesalius’ use of metaphor was in fact a continuation of a stylistic and polemic tradition. Metaphor had been used by earlier writers, and in some cases, Vesalius drew from their dictionary of established comparisons directly.\n\nBut always, observation served imagination, and never the opposite. The best example of Vesalius’ insistence on deriving metaphor from observable truth is his abandonment of the Galenic conception of the liver as having four main lobes, an idea which Galen acquired from his dissections of dogs. These lobes were colorfully called the hearth, the table, the knife, and the charioteer, in relation to their functions. After describing this tradition, Vesalius addresses this metaphor directly and in his usual straightforward way: “This arrant nonsense exemplifies the fancies of those who study the human fabric by imagination rather than dissection or try to learn from procedures on animals rather than humans.”\n\nSince many of the structures Vesalius encountered did not yet have proper names, using creative analogues as visual signposts and descriptions of function was still a natural solution. With the intention that both elites and humble students would read his work, he carefully chose accessible symbols as his objects of comparison. His metaphors reveal not only the state of anatomical knowledge of the time, but realms of shared experience.\n\nMany of the metaphors used in the Fabrica could have been written today. Vesalius sees the veins and arteries like a pipe, synovial fluid like oil, and the skeleton like the walls and supportive beams of a house. His mechanical metaphors strike one as especially current to our post-industrial way of thinking, but Vesalius’ conception of the body as a whole formed by moving parts placed human being’s engines and inventions in imitation of nature, and not the other way around.\n\nWe find city streets in the digestive system, a winepress in the sinuses, a storeroom in the stomach, and reins and pulleys in the ligaments. The Vesalian body was not gears and oil, but rather wood, stone, and all things organic and ingeniously designed by nature (ingeniously, but pragmatically. Of the physical separation of the mouth and the remainder of the digestive system, he writes, “…the Creator of the world set the stomach below the thorax and the viscera contained therein, so that the outflow of the excrement would be lower down and well away from the senses that reside in the head; similarly in buildings the architects keep the inescapably unpleasant outflows well away from the eyes and nostrils of the owners”).\n\nTo describe muscles, he draws upon the images of a spinning top, a ray fish, a pyramid, the letter C, a butcher’s cleaver, and Benedictine cowls. Horns, nets, rivers, pumpkin vines, pigeon coops, wickerwork baskets full of curdled milk, grape root, and tree trunks shelter elsewhere in the anatomy, somehow envisioned amidst what must have appeared, to the untrained eye, as a bloody mess beneath the scalpel. Amidst lengthy, precise descriptions, these metaphors are bursts of color and clarity, never mixed or muddled even when presented in close proximity. As a Latin stylist, Vesalius was far from florid, making his choices of imagery interesting in their individual precision, contrasted with their overall diversity across the pages.\n\nA modern translation of the Fabrica from Latin to English, in its entirety, has revealed the full breadth of the author’s attention to detail, as well as his clarity in describing anatomical structures which still puzzle and entrance new students of anatomy to this day. Jacob Soll has suggested that Vesalius’ manner of making the body more complex while at once demystifying it “changed the nature of corporeal metaphor.” The recent discovery of his own annotated copy of the Fabrica suggests that Vesalius continued to think about his choice of words well after publication. Whatever his qualms with the minutiae of his legacy, the Fabrica remains a work that struck the imaginative faculties and changed the practice of anatomy generations before technology would penetrate the flesh and render it truly visible in three dimensions.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the significance of Nathanael West's \"The Day of the Locust\"?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hollywood has served as a novelist’s muse for almost a century. The list of writers who found inspiration there includes the likes of Fitzgerald, Mailer, Schulberg, Bukowski, Chandler, Huxley, Waugh, and O’Hara, among plenty of others. But the gold standard for Hollywood fiction remains “The Day of the Locust.”\n\nNathanael West—novelist, screenwriter, playwright—was one of the most original writers of his generation, a comic artist whose insight into the brutalities of modern life would prove remarkably prophetic. In addition to “The Day of the Locust” he is the author of another classic “Miss Lonelyhearts” (1933) as well as two minor works, “The Dream Life of Balso Snell” (1931) and “A Cool Million” (1934).\n\nSeventy years after publication, “The Day of the Locust” is still the most significant novel ever written about Hollywood. Beyond that, West’s story examines America during the Great Depression, revealing a diseased country being stained by corruption, hypocrisy, greed, and rage.\n\nMovie stars who get their faces on the screen did not excite West. Neither was he dazzled by Hollywood as the glitz and glamour capital of the world. Instead, his tale goes backstage to focus on the raw inner workings of a byzantine business and the working stiffs who write scripts, design sets, and appear in crowd scenes.\n\nIn the novel’s opening scene, a mob of fake infantry and cavalry is being herded away to fight the fake Battle of Waterloo. “Stage Nine—you bastards—Stage Nine!” a second unit director shouts hysterically through his megaphone.\n\nWest’s heroes are the cheated ones dredged up from the sea of extras and bit players, the menial assistant directors and lowly writers. Buzzing in the background, meanwhile, are the locusts, the plagues of angry migrants disconnected from Middle America, seduced by the promise of California sunshine and citrus (“The Grapes of Wrath” showcases some of the same displaced folks). Battered by hard knocks, these ragtag bands hang out at movie premieres to gawk at celebrities and sometimes they freak out and start busting balls for no apparent reason. In “The Day of the Locust,” they are first responsible for a bloody murder, then they riot and start setting fire to the city.\n\nBy paying homage to the Hollywood machine and its invisible workers, West was able to illuminate the film business from the bottom up. There is not much beauty to be found in what he called the “Dream Dump,” or in his chronicle of American life in the Thirties. It is all violence all the time, with sickening scenes that still retain the power to shock. W.H. Auden would call West’s people “cripples.” They were not cripples to West, who lovingly described his excitable characters as “screwballs and screwboxes.” His original title for the book, “The Cheated,” accurately reflected their frustration.\n\nA native New Yorker, West spent his early life managing Manhattan hotels and writing in his spare time. His first three novels earned a pathetic total of $780, hardly a living wage even during the Depression. Losing confidence in himself as a novelist, West in 1935 moved to Hollywood, where he found a screenwriting job at one of the poorest studios, Republic, whose biggest stars were horses and singing cowboys. At the same time that he was learning the craft of movie writing, he was forming the ideas for his next novel.\n\n1939 was a great year for fiction. John Steinbeck’s “The Grapes of Wrath” immediately went off the grid, creating heat and noise when it shot onto the bestseller list and won a Pulitzer (soon the book would become a movie classic starring Henry Fonda). Unfortunately, “The Day of the Locust” was eclipsed by Steinbeck’s blockbuster when it was published a few weeks later. Like his previous books, it was unbought, unread, and clobbered by most literary critics, including some of West’s own friends like Edmund Wilson who took an unexpected swipe at the novel (it did not measure up to Miss Lonelyhearts, Wilson thought).\n\nWriting to his friend F. Scott Fitzgerald, West sounds like a slugger who’s been knocked out: “So far the box score stands: Good reviews—fifteen percent, bad reviews—twenty five percent, brutal personal attacks, sixty percent.” Even worse, he fretted, “Sales: practically none.”\n\nHe went on to tell Edmund Wilson that “the book is what the publisher calls a definite flop.” This was a blow, because its brilliance had impressed Random House and the publisher Bennett Cerf. As a result, pre-publication prospects could not have been brighter. Turning on a dime, a vexed Cerf failed to promote the title and went on to grumble that he never wanted to see another novel about Hollywood. This proved a bit of an exaggeration because he would shortly publish Budd Schulberg’s What Makes Sammy Run? Who said the book business was soft-hearted?\n\nWest, devastated, was trying his damnedest to sound cheerful. In truth, he felt awfully confused. “I seem to have no market whatsoever,” he said.\n\n“The Day of the Locust” would be West’s last book. In December, 1940, he and his wife Eileen were killed in a car crash in the middle of the lettuce fields near El Centro, California. He was 37, she was 27. That he should perish dramatically on the highway came as no surprise to his friends, because he was known to be one of the world’s worst drivers.\n\nDespite West’s claim to be writing another novel, his effects included only a few notes for a story that sounds similar to Miss Lonelyhearts. During the last year of his life, he finally began achieving success as a screenwriter, a highly paid profession in the Thirties. Had he lived, I believe he would have continued to work in Hollywood as a screenwriter, director, or producer. He enjoyed the nice Southern California weather, not to mention a nice fat bank account. Would he have written more novels? Maybe. Then again, maybe not.\n\nIn the decade following his premature death, West’s fiction was pretty much ignored until it made a comeback in the 1950s. Now “The Day of the Locust” is a classic and its author considered one of America’s premier novelists.\n\nIronically, it took thirty-five years for a screen adaptation of West’s masterpiece. In 1975, John Schlesinger directed a big-budget production, whose spectacular finale showed rioters going on a rampage and setting fire to Los Angeles. Probably, West would have got a kick out of seeing his screwballs and screwboxes on the screen.\n\nThis article [In Hollywood with Nathanael West] was originally published in The Public Domain Review [http:\/\/publicdomainreview.org\/2011\/01\/01\/in-hollywood-with-nathanael-west\/] under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0.

{"prompt":"What is the appeal of James Riley's account of his enslavement by Berber tribesmen in North Africa?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In 1817, the American sea captain, James Riley, published An Authentic Narrative of the Loss of the American Brig “Commerce,” Wrecked on the Western Coast of Africa, in the Month of August, 1815, with an Account of the Sufferings of the Surviving Officers and Crew, who were Enslaved by the Wandering Arabs of the Great African Desert or Zahahrah. More recently, Captain Riley’s memoir has been reprinted, though with a title that better fits modern sensibilities: Sufferings in Africa: the Incredible True Story of a Shipwreck, Enslavement, and Survival on the Sahara (New York: Skyhorse, 2007). This edition, along with a fictionalized version by Dean King, called Skeletons on the Zahara: A True Story of Survival (New York: Back Bay Books, 2005) enjoy respectable sales for reprints of a book nearly two centuries old.\n\nCaptain Riley’s story is pretty well summed up by the original title of his book. While sailing from Gibraltar to the Cape Verde Islands, Riley’s mid-sized merchant ship got lost in the fog and wrecked on the west Moroccan coast. Trapped on shore and having run out of both food and water, Riley and the surviving crew threw themselves on the mercy of some passing Berber tribesmen, who promptly enslaved and carried them off into the desert. Abused, underfed, and overworked, the captives were nearly dead when their masters sold them to an Arab trader, who bought the Americans on Riley’s promise of ransom if they returned to the coast. The rest of An Authentic Narrative recounts the survivors’ slightly less brutal journey over desert and mountains to the port city of Mogador (modern Essaouira) and their eventual freedom.\n\nLike many another adventure story, Captain Riley’s tale was essentially ghost written. The real author was Riley’s “respectable friend, Anthony Bleecker [or Bleeker], Esquire of New York,” called in as Riley himself put it, “to smooth down the asperities of my unlearned style.” Starting with Riley’s logbook, notes, and recollections, Bleecker applied his own “talents, judgements, and erudition,” and in under a year came up with a narrative rich in emotional, and even spiritual themes. In the process, Bleecker spun what had actually been a fairly short adventure—the whole story, from the shipwreck until the survivors’ return to Mogador, lasted barely two months, of which only the first three weeks were spent as slaves of the Berbers—into an epic tale of survival against both human and natural odds.\n\nAn Authentic Narrative was hardly the first Christian enslavement account—though it was nearly the last to be set in North Africa. Other unlucky travelers had also been shipwrecked on the wild Atlantic coast of Africa, south of Agadir, and a few of them survived to produce similar accounts. Paul Baepler, in White Slaves, African Masters (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999), offered several tales of brutal treatment by such slaves, made worse, if possible, by the terrifying and bleak Saharan landscapes and by the desperate conditions they were forced to share with the nomadic Berbers, who themselves lived on the margins of survival. One was by Robert Adams, an African-American sailor whose ship ran aground in the fog in 1810, several hundred miles south of where Riley came ashore. Adams was a slave for over three years and with his wandering masters, made it as far as Timbuktu. Another castaway, the American woman Eliza Bradley, supposedly spent eight months in Berber hands, though some have questioned her account as “a work of anonymous fiction that also plagiarizes large sections from James Riley’s best-selling account.”\n\nThe captivity accounts of Riley, Adams, and Bradley (if indeed she existed) were not typical examples of the genre, however. Far more common were the stories of European and American Christians who fell into the hands, not of nomadic Berbers but of Barbary corsairs. Of these we have scores of examples, published and unpublished, in languages ranging from Latin and Spanish to Italian, French, Portuguese, English, Dutch, German, and Icelandic. The earliest date back to Miguel de Cervantes, a slave in Algiers from 1575-80; among the last was the Italian poet Filippo Pananti’s Narrative of a Residence in Algiers, published the same year as Riley’s Authentic Narrative. The corsairs who captured them were professional slavers, ranging the entire length of the Mediterranean and (after 1600) out into the Atlantic, as far afield as the Cape Verde Islands and Iceland. These freebooters took their captives from merchant ships, fishing boats, and any village they could sack, selling them in the slave markets of Salé on Morocco’s Atlantic coast, or in Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, on the Barbary Coast. Some captives—the very wealthy and many women—were bought by dealers who specialized in ransoming and were often well treated, more as hostages than as slaves. The great majority were properly enslaved, though, worked hard by their masters, regularly beaten and sold when they were no longer fit or profitable. At least an eighth of the captives were allocated to the state, its share in recompense for supporting the corsairs. They were set to work on state projects—building the harbor, or fortifications, digging in quarries, serving as longshoremen; or rowing in the galleys. Those sold to private masters were either used as house servants or farm laborers or rented out to potters, tanners, construction bosses, or water sellers. A lucky few managed to run shops or taverns, paying their masters a monthly fee for the privilege. Women not suitable for ransoming generally ended up in the harem of wealthy corsairs or the ruling pasha, either as serving maids or concubines.\n\nWhereas Captain Riley experienced his captivity within the confines of a small and socially simple nomadic band, those Europeans taken to Barbary were thrown into crowded cities that teemed with myriads of slaves, free Christians, renegade Christians (who had “taken the turban”), Turkish janissaries, Jews, Arabs, Berbers, Greeks, and black Africans. In its heyday, Algiers was immensely powerful, one of the richest cities on the Mediterranean, and, like Salé, a kind of merchant republic, run by the same corsairs who had grown rich through slaving. Each of those Barbary slaves who wrote about it portrayed different aspects of captivity—Francis Knight and João Mascarenhas portrayed life as galley slaves; Emanuel d’Aranda and Chastelet des Boys described many other kinds of slave labor, plus the daunting task of arranging their own ransom. Louis Marot and William Okeley, on the other hand, were fairly successful slave entrepreneurs, who also managed to escape from their bondage; the American Joseph Foss and the Italian Filippo Pananti wrote at length about the conditions of slavery during the institution’s last years. Many of these captivity narratives are now being republished. Those that have not are often available online, for anyone who knows where to look.\n\nNevertheless, it is James Riley’s spare account of slavery and in its barest and bleakest terms that has consistently outsold all the rest of these narratives combined. Its American debut was soon followed by a British edition and within a year a French translation, titled Naufrage du brigantin américain El commerce, perdu sur la côte occidentale d’Afrique, au mois d’août 1815 (Paris: Le Normant, 1818); the following year saw a German version. Back home, An Authentic Narrative was republished no fewer than eighteen times by 1860. Like any bestseller, the book also accrued its share of celebrity blurbs. Henry David Thoreau and James Fenimore Cooper both praised it, and, above all, Abraham Lincoln included it in his 1860 campaign biography—along with Pilgrim’s Progress and The Bible—as one of the books that had shaped his youthful development.\n\nThe modern appeal of An Authentic Narrative certainly stretches beyond its illustrious American readership—there have been two French re-publications in just the last two years. Its popularity says a great deal about the public’s new fascination with the Muslim world and the whole “clash of civilizations” thesis, which has so dominated political discourse since 9\/11. Perhaps it is no surprise Riley’s story has taken a greater hold on the modern imagination than those set in the cities of Barbary. His austere and desperate tale revolves around a restricted cast of characters, like a Chekhov play: Riley himself and his few American comrades; their nameless handful of Berber tormentors; the Arab, Sidi Hamet, who effectively rescued them; and the English consul, William Willshire, who redeemed them and set them free. The simplicity and intimacy of Riley’s story—which closely resembles contemporary American captivity accounts, where settlers fell into the hands of American Indians—presents an uncluttered narrative arc, a Dantean tale of the descent of a lost wanderer into the hell of bondage and despair, only to rise again through a redemption earned by steadfastness. It is a tale fit for the movies (Dean King made a documentary), which may explain its enduring popularity in comparison with the more complex and subtle Barbary enslavement narratives, where victims and persecutors, the damned and the saved, the righteous and the foolish, are often so much harder to tell apart.\n\nThis article [Slavery in North Africa—the Famous Story of Captain James Riley] was originally published in The Public Domain Review [http:\/\/publicdomainreview.org\/2011\/10\/03\/slavery-in-north-africa-the-famous-story-of-captain-james-riley\/] under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0.

{"prompt":"How does Edwin Abbott's book 'Flatland' use dimensional analogies to explore the social hierarchy of Victorian England?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Edwin Abbott Abbott, who became Headmaster of the City of London School at the early age of 26, was renowned as a teacher, writer, theologian, Shakespearean scholar, and classicist. He was a religious reformer, a tireless educator, and an advocate of social democracy and improved education for women. Yet his main claim to fame today is none of these: a strange little book, the first and almost the only one of its genre: mathematical fantasy. Abbott called it Flatland, and published it in 1884 under the pseudonym A. Square.\n\nOn the surface—and the setting, the imaginary world of Flatland, is a surface, an infinite Euclidean plane—the book is a straightforward narrative about geometrically-shaped beings that live in a two-dimensional world. A. Square, an ordinary sort of chap, undergoes a mystical experience: a visitation by the mysterious Sphere from the Third Dimension, who carries him to new worlds and new geometries. Inspired by evangelical zeal, he strives to convince his fellow citizens that the world is not limited to the two dimensions accessible to their senses, falls foul of the religious authorities, and ends up in jail.\n\nThe story has a timeless appeal, and has never been out of print since its first publication. It has spawned several sequels and has been the subject of at least one radio program and two animated films. Not only is the book about hidden dimensions: it has its own hidden dimensions. Its secret mathematical agenda is not the notion of two dimensions, but that of four. Its social agenda pokes fun at the rigid stratification of Victorian society, especially the low status of women, even the wives and daughters of the wealthy.\n\nFlatland’s inhabitants are triangles, squares, and other geometric figures. In the planar world’s orderly hierarchy, one’s status depends on one’s degree of regularity and how many sides one has. An isosceles triangle is superior to a scalene triangle (all sides different) but inferior to an equilateral triangle. But all triangles must defer to squares, which in turn defer to pentagons, hexagons, right up to the pinnacle of Flatland society, the Priestshood. Referred to as ‘circles,’ the priests are polygons with so many sides that no one can distinguish them. The sons of squares are usually pentagons, the grandsons hexagons, so there is a general progression along the greasy pole (there is no ‘up’ in Flatland).\n\nBut what of the wives and daughters? Flatland’s women are mere line segments, very thin triangles, whose social standing is zero. Their intelligence is little greater. They are required by law to wiggle from side to side so that they can be seen, and to emit loud cries so they can be heard, because a collision with a woman is as fatal as one with a stiletto. Abbott took a bit of stick from some of his female contemporaries, who failed to appreciate his irony. But we know from his own life, including his daughter’s education, that he did a lot to improve the status of women and to ensure they received the same level of education as men.\n\nAbbott was not particularly good at, or keen on, mathematics, but his book tackled an issue of great interest in Victorian times, the notion of four (or more) dimensions. This idea was becoming fundamental in science and mathematics, and it was also being invoked in areas like theology and spiritualism, because an invisible extra dimension was just the place to locate God, the spirit world, or ghosts. Charlatans like the American medium Henry Slade were exploiting conjuring tricks to claim access to the Fourth Dimension. Legitimate hyperspace philosophers were speculating about the role that additional dimensions might play in illuminating the human condition.\n\nFlatland approaches this topic by way of a dimensional analogy, widely used ever since, and not entirely Abbott’s own invention. The difficulties facing a three-dimensional Victorian attempting to grasp the geometry of four dimensions are similar to those facing A. Square attempting to grasp the geometry of three. Among Abbott’s sources for this analogy were frequent social encounters with eminent scientists such as the physicist John Tyndall, whom he met at George Eliot’s house in 1871. Tyndall may have told Abbott about the work of Hermann von Helmholtz, who gave public lectures on non-Euclidean geometry using the image of an imaginary two-dimensional creature living on a mathematical surface. Another likely source is the outrageous Charles Howard Hinton, who wrote his own book about a two-dimensional world in his 1907 An Episode of Flatland: How a Plane Folk Discovered the Third Dimension.\n\nAbbott’s mathematico-literary legacy is a series of Flatland spin-offs: Dionys Burger’s Sphereland, Rudy Rucker’s short story Message Found in a Copy of Flatland and his novel The Fourth Dimension, Alexander Keewatin Dewdney’s The Planiverse, and my own Flatterland. But what he was trying to tell his readers was more subtle. Just as a humble square can transcend his plane world and aspire to the Third Dimension, so the women and the lower classes of Victorian England could transcend the confines of their stratified society and aspire to a higher plane of existence.

{"prompt":"What was William Fairfield Warren's reasoning for thinking the Garden of Eden was at the North Pole?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The quest to find the Garden of Eden sounds like an occupation that should have fallen by the wayside well before the nineteenth century. No longer did the fanciful medieval geographies of Prester John or Columbus allow for the existence of an exotic, unspoiled earthly paradise. This was a newer, wiser age. We had conquered the wild regions of the world. And Darwin’s Origin of Species, published in 1859, was slowly proving that human beings and, say, the birds of the air, were not created all at once in a single spot on the globe.\n\nDarwin himself dismissed the search for a geographical point of origins in his 1871 Descent of Man. He allowed that: “It is somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere.” But, he declared, there was also a large ape that roamed Europe not so long ago, and anyway the earth is old enough for primate species to have migrated all the way around it by now. So, “It is useless to speculate on this subject.”\n\nVictoria Woodhull, feminist radical and free-love advocate, was less diplomatic in her epic speech “The Garden of Eden,” which she delivered frequently in the 1870s. Eden on Earth was nonsense: “Any school boy of twelve years of age who should read the description of this garden and not discover that it has no geographical significance whatever, ought to be reprimanded for his stupidity.” Perhaps she was referring to the missionary-explorer David Livingstone, who had declared, while mad with malaria in 1871, that paradise existed at the source of the Nile, which he judged to be in the Lake Bangweulu region of Zambia.\n\nLivingstone was not the only one still looking for Eden. This brave new world was turning time-honored beliefs upside down. Evolution was suggesting that human beings had ascended over time from our less-intelligent, animalistic primate origins. But Christianity had been insisting for centuries that human beings had descended, through original sin, from near-divine heights in the Garden of Eden to the miserable, depraved society of the late nineteenth century. What was a modern, faithful person to believe? Enter William Fairfield Warren, distinguished Methodist minister and educator. As the president of Boston University, he knew science was going to define the future. But he was unwilling to give up his theology to the new discipline. How to knit the two perspectives together?\n\nCounter-intuitively, Warren looked to Eden. He set about translating the Bible into science: Eden was “the one spot on Earth where the biological conditions are the most favorable.” Genesis says Eden contains “every tree that is pleasant to the eye or good for food”; Warren posited “flora and fauna of almost unimagined vigor and luxuriousness.” He took note of a newly-discovered fact: millions of years ago, Earth had been much warmer. He followed the uncovering of fantastic creatures at once familiar and mythical, like the woolly mammoth, the dinosaur, and the giant sequoia. He knew there was still one blank spot on the world map, a place where nobody had been. And he arrived at the inevitable conclusion: the Garden of Eden is at the North Pole. It made sense, in a way. Both Eden and the Pole had frustratingly resisted attempts to discover and claim them, despite centuries of dangerous, expensive expeditions.###"}
{"prompt":"What led Geronimo to become one of the most famous figures in the history of the American Indian resistance effort?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Geronimo (1829-1909), whose given name was Goyahkla, sometimes spelled Goyathlay, is one of the most famous figures in the history of the American Indian resistance effort. His name is synonymous with that of a warrior—so much so that his name has been appropriated for a wide range of military (or simply adventuresome) endeavors. Geronimo’s reputation is well deserved, for his very name excited fear in settlers both north and south of the U.S.-Mexican border. He was hated by Euro-Americans and even by some Apaches, who blamed him for continuing to stoke the fires of warfare after the ultimate defeat of the Apaches seemed inevitable. In addition, he lacked the social and political leadership skills of a Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce and the multidimensional qualities (including the spiritual character) of Sitting Bull, the great Lakota leader who served as a magnet, attracting huge numbers of Plains Indians to him—a force that would secure the most famous resistance victory ever against the U.S. military at Little Bighorn in 1876.\n\nGeronimo was primarily a fighter, a lasting reputation that led American paratroopers in World War II to call out the name “Geronimo” before plunging from their planes. Schoolchildren, for decades after Geronimo’s death, would similarly yell his name before undertaking a real or imagined feat of bravery, such as leaping from a swing into a river. A much more recent, and highly controversial, use of Geronimo’s name was its employment by the U.S. military as a code name linked to the 2011 operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe association of Geronimo’s name with that of the hated terrorist elicited considerable resentment by a wide range of organizations and individuals, including the National Congress of American Indians, the Onondaga National Council of chiefs, Native American publications, Fort Sill Apache Tribal Chairman Jeff Houser, and Geronimo’s great-grandson Harlyn Geronimo. Their response was so intense that the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs took up the issue at a hearing previously scheduled to discuss the use of Indian names and images as sports mascots and in other areas of popular culture. Defense Department officials argued they had intended no disrespect to Geronimo and had named the total operation against bin Laden Operation Neptune Spear, further naming each step alphabetically. The “G” step involved the capture or killing of bin Laden and was coded with the Indian leader’s name, an explanation that did not do much to satisfy those who had raised objections to the use of Geronimo’s name.\n\nSo, what led Geronimo onto the path that would lead from the battlefields of Mexico and the Southwest to a raid into Pakistan? Although it would be serious oversimplification to reduce all of Geronimo’s public life to one incident, certainly his life as a warrior was deeply influenced by a very personal event: an attack on an Apache camp by a Mexican general, José María Carrasco.\n\nFor years, Apaches had been both trading with and fighting Mexicans. As soon as he reached adulthood, at about the age of seventeen, Goyahkla, who was not yet known as Geronimo, was accepted as a warrior and entered into this dual relationship with Mexicans. About two years earlier, around 1844, Goyahkla’s father, Taklishim, had died of an illness, and Goyahkla assumed responsibility for his mother, Juana (Juanita). Geronimo’s autobiography—dictated to Stephen M. Barrett, superintendent of schools in Lawton, Oklahoma, with Asa Adklugie, a former student at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, translated, and published in 1906—shows a son deeply committed to his mother.\n\nShortly after becoming a warrior, Goyahkla married a young Nednai Apache, Alope, giving a herd of ponies—a substantial sum—to her father, Noposo, for the privilege of wedding her. The price, according to his autobiography, was set so high because she was a good daughter and her father perhaps wanted to keep her with him. Goyahkla and Alope had been lovers for some time, and he records in the autobiography that his greatest joy upon arriving at adulthood was that he could marry her. Goyahkla took Alope to live near his mother. His bride decorated their tipi with beads and pictures drawn on buckskin. She was a good wife, he notes, and they were happy together with their three children.\n\nWhen Goyahkla crossed into Mexico again around 1850 (Geronimo in his autobiography cites 1858, but is often off in his dating), he had no reason to suspect anything out of the usual. Traveling in a large group under Mangas Coloradas, the Apaches—including members of the Bedonkohe band to which Goyahkla belonged and the Nednai band, both subdivisions of the Chiricahua Apaches—passed through Sonora on their way to Casas Grandes. They camped at what is generally believed to be Janos (but referred to as Kaskiyeh in the autobiography), and many of the men went into town to trade. This went on for several days, each time a guard of men staying behind to protect the women, children, and supplies.\n\nOne afternoon, however, as the men were returning to camp, they met some women and children fleeing from Mexican troops who had attacked the camp, killing the guards as well as many of the women and children, destroying supplies, and stealing the Apaches’ ponies. When Goyahkla reached the camp, he discovered his wife, mother, and three children were all dead. He tells in his autobiography of going off by himself and standing by a river. Geronimo, so many years after the event, does not say what he was feeling at that river, but his understated description clearly speaks powerfully to a great grief and sense of loss.\n\nWithout supplies and with most of their weapons and ponies lost, the survivors turned back toward Arizona. The elderly Geronimo recalls how he was unable to pray or devise any plan of action at the moment—devoid of purpose, he followed his comrades silently, staying by himself just within hearing of the now much-smaller group.\n\nArriving at his home, Goyahkla gazed, certainly with great sorrow, at Alope’s decorations and their children’s toy before burning them, along with his tipi and his mother’s. Never again, Geronimo notes in his autobiography, would he feel content in his own home. Then, turning from his immediate grief, he vowed revenge on the Mexicans. A year later, Goyahkla returned to Mexico within a large war party and began to exact that revenge. It reportedly was during this excursion into Mexico that his enemies began calling him Geronimo, although no definitive explanation for the naming has ever been given. The name stuck, and Geronimo would continue his battles against Mexicans and, before long, settlers and soldiers of the United States who invaded his homeland, earning the warrior’s reputation that would stay with him throughout his life and into the twenty-first century, even into places that Geronimo could never have imagined, such as Pakistan.\n\nAt first glance, Geronimo seems an unlikely candidate to compose his life story and be willing to share it with those whom he had been fighting for most of his adult life. There is a great desire, however, in many people, perhaps in most, to want to set the record straight and be understood and Geronimo seems to have been no different in this regard. He also expressed his hope that his story might persuade the government to allow him and other Apaches to return to their native Southwest to live. In addition, Geronimo saw his autobiography as a way to make money; during his late years as a prisoner, he had learned the power of money and had taken to selling photographs, buttons, and other souvenirs. Consequently, when Barrett raised the possibility of telling his story, Geronimo insisted that he be paid for doing so. Geronimo’s occasional suspicions that Superintendent Barrett may have wanted his story in order to do him harm were softened by the presence of translator Asa Adklugie, who was a son of Juh (also spelled Whoa), a longtime friend, ally, and cousin by marriage. Fully aware that he was hated by many and at the mercy of the government, Geronimo was politically astute as he narrated his exploits, focusing in detail on his battles with Mexicans but remaining generally reticent concerning encounters with the U.S. military.\n\nStill, the autobiography probably would never have been published without the support of President Theodore Roosevelt. Barrett’s request to write Geronimo’s life was rejected by the military, but an appeal to the President brought the desired permission. Responding later to the complete manuscript, President Roosevelt again offered his support but with the suggestion that Barrett clarify that opinions expressed in the book were Geronimo’s alone. Roosevelt was not hard to convince. Prior to Barrett’s request, Roosevelt had himself made a request that Geronimo ride in his inaugural parade in March 1905, which the Apache leader did. Before leaving Washington, Geronimo met with the President and made a plea to be permitted to return to his homeland. Roosevelt listened compassionately but refused, explaining that he feared reprisals against the Apaches by area residents if they returned. When the autobiography was published in 1906, Geronimo, still trying, and apparently believing that the President might relent, dedicated his narrative to President Roosevelt.###"}
{"prompt":"The boundary between life and deathThe boundary between life and death is imaginary and that it might be breached.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Far from the fantastic and improbable tale that Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein now seems to us, the novel was declared by one reviewer upon publication to have “an air of reality attached to it, by being connected with the favourite projects and passions of the times.”1 Among these were the scientific investigations into the states of life and death. Considerable uncertainty surrounded these categories—so much so that it was not far-fetched that Frankenstein should assert: “Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds” (ch. 4). He was not alone in considering that the boundary between life and death was imaginary and that it might be breached.\n\nWorried by the potential inability to distinguish between the states of life and death, two doctors, William Hawes and Thomas Cogan, set up the Royal Humane Society in London in 1774. It was initially called the “Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned”; its aims were to publish information to help people resuscitate others, and it paid for attempts to save lives (the Society paid more money if the attempt was successful). Many people could not swim at this time despite the fact that they worked and lived along London’s rivers and canals. There was an annual procession of those “raised from the dead” by the Society’s methods, which may well have included people who had intended suicide too. One such seems to have been Mary Shelley’s mother, the feminist, Mary Wollstonecraft, who after leaping from Putney Bridge into the Thames in the depth of depression, complained “I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery.” The pun on her “inhumane” treatment may well refer to the efforts of the Humane Society in rescuing her.2 The spectacular tales of apparent resurrections from the dead by the Society fed the public’s concern that it was impossible to be sure whether a person was truly dead and, consequently, fears of being buried alive grew.\n\nThere was a scientific basis for the public’s anxieties. The French Encyclopédie distinguished between two kinds of death, “incomplete” and “absolute”: “That there is no remedy for death is an axiom widely admitted; we, however, are willing to affirm that death can be cured.”3 In London, James Curry, a physician at Guy’s hospital and one of the Shelleys’ doctors in 1817, wrote a book that gave information on how to identify what he called “absolute” from “apparent” death.4 In the book, he argued that the putrefaction of the body was the only way to be completely sure a person was dead. There was interest in states of “suspended animation,” such as fainting, coma, and sleeping. Mary Shelley followed contemporary scientific language when she described episodes of fainting within the novel. When Victor Frankenstein creates the creature, he collapses because of a nervous illness and describes himself in this state as “lifeless.” In this instance, it is Clerval who “restored” him to “life” (ch. 5). Elizabeth faints on seeing the corpse of William: “She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh” (ch. 7). The language here is of a life lost and restored; while Elizabeth is unconscious, she is described as being dead.\n\nThere were serious attempts, too, to reanimate the truly dead. In the latter half of the eighteenth century, the Italian physician Luigi Galvani found that frog’s legs twitched as if alive when struck by a spark of electricity. In her 1831 Preface to Frankenstein, Mary Shelley mentions how discussions on this idea that one could electrically stimulate a dead muscle into apparent life—known as “galvanism”—came to influence her story.\n\nMany and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to which I was a devout but nearly silent listener. During one of these, various philosophical doctrines were discussed, and among others the nature of the principle of life, and whether there was any probability of its ever being discovered and communicated. Perhaps a corpse would be reanimated; galvanism had given token of such things: perhaps the component parts of a creature might be manufactured, brought together, and endued with vital warmth.\n\nNight waned upon this talk, and even the witching hour had gone by, before we retired to rest. When I placed my head on my pillow, I did not sleep, nor could I be said to think. My imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me, gifting the successive images that arose in my mind with a vividness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie. I saw—with shut eyes, but acute mental vision—I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital motion.\n\nGalvani’s nephew, Giovanni Aldini, progressed from frog legs to attempting the reanimation of hanged criminals, making use of the “Murder Act” of 1752, which added the punishment of dissection to hanging. In 1803, Aldini was able to experiment with some success upon George Forster, who had been found guilty of murdering his wife and child. Onlookers report that Forster’s eye opened, his right hand was raised and clenched, and his legs moved.\n\nM. Aldini, who is the nephew of the discoverer of this most interesting science, showed the eminent and superior powers of galvanism to be far beyond any other stimulant in nature. On the first application of the process to the face, the jaws of the deceased criminal began to quiver, and the adjoining muscles were horribly contorted, and one eye was opened. In the subsequent part of the process, the right hand was raised and clenched, and the legs and thighs were set in motion. Mr Pass, the beadle of the Surgeons’ Company, who was officially present during this experiment, was so alarmed that he died of fright soon after his return home.5\n\nIn Mary and Percy Shelleys’ tragic personal lives, there is much evidence that they believed the dead could be successfully reanimated. For example, Percy Shelley writes of their child, William Shelley’s last illness: “By the skill of the physician, he was once reanimated after the process of death had actually commenced, and he lived four days after that time”.6 Death, it seems, could be reversed.\n\nIn the years leading up to Mary Shelley’s publication of Frankenstein, there was a public debate in the Royal College of Surgeons between two surgeons, John Abernethy and William Lawrence, on the nature of life itself. Both of these surgeons had links with the Shelleys: Percy had read one of Abernethy’s books and quoted it in his own work and Lawrence had been the Shelleys’ doctor.7 In this debate, questions were asked about how to define life, and how living bodies were different to dead or inorganic bodies. Abernethy argued that life did not depend upon the body’s structure, the way it was organized or arranged, but existed separately as a material substance—a kind of vital principle, “superadded” to the body. His opponent, Lawrence, thought this was a ridiculous idea and instead understood life as the working operation of all the body’s functions—the sum of its parts. Lawrence’s ideas were seen as being too radical: they seemed to suggest that the soul, which was often seen as being akin to the vital principle, did not exist either. Lawrence was forced to withdraw the book in which he had published his lectures and resign the hospital post he held, though he was reinstated after publicly denouncing the views he had put forward. The episode showed how controversial the categories of life and dead had become and provided further inspiration for Mary Shelley’s novel.\n\nSources###"}
{"prompt":"What is the difference between living a life based on consciousness and living a life based on thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" We are not our bodies, our thoughts, or our emotions. Before we are born, we do not decide on the body we will have. Our thoughts are reactions to stimuli and sometimes reactions to those reactions. Our emotions are responses to stimuli and sometimes responses to those responses. Our names are words to identify ourselves and can be changed with the flick of a pen.\n\nSo, what makes us us? If we were to say we are the sum total of a body, emotions, and thoughts, that would be incorrect. They are subjective components of our existence. What is our objective existence, then?\n\nAbove all, we are the witnesses of our existence. We are conscious of our body, emotions, and thoughts. This consciousness is our objective self. Without it, we might as well be machines.\n\nBut as per usual, we are not in touch with this consciousness fully. Instead, we run our lives autonomously, as if our existence is a series of reactions and responses. Our true nature is not to act like a configuration of silicon, but to be free in the opportunities and possibilities of the moment.\n\nHow do we base our lives on consciousness rather than on thoughts, emotions, and our body? It is not easy to detach oneself from what appears to be who we are. The most effective way to distance oneself from the subjective parts of life is to not take them so seriously.\n\nThis does not mean you should not take showers, should not cry at funerals, or dismiss thoughts altogether—just take mundane existence with less graveness. When we look in a mirror, most of us identify with an image. Our bodies, emotions, and thoughts are tools–though they are misused to a great degree.\n\nWhat is the use of our bodies, emotions, and thoughts? Our bodies provide conveyance and expression. Our emotions can give way to compassion and understanding. Our thoughts can be expressions of inspiration. The key component in the use of these three is construction. When guided by these three, we should base our actions on whether we are doing something constructive or destructive.\n\nWhen acting through pure consciousness–devoid of attachment to thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations–the choice of construction or destruction is no longer available. Thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations are dualistic, whereas pure consciousness is not.\n\nWhen we experience reality through consciousness alone, each thing we perceive simply is, without branding or conditions. Ironically, the highest state we can achieve is the state of being ourselves. The utter simplicity of it makes it difficult to attain.\n\nWe want to hold onto something: our name, our profession, our family, our memories, our aspirations, and so on. We want a sense of comfort and security of identity. Not knowing oneself is scary for most individuals.\n\nBut the most frightening of all is knowing that you have been living a lie and that your life thus far has been trivial. When we realize we have been conducting our lives based on a subjective existence, we feel like we have been a slave of our senses–which is true. And what can be more degrading than being a slave?\n\nWe are slaves until we can witness our thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations dispassionately. Even if we have attained pure consciousness for a few moments, it is not enough. As soon as we direct and delve our attention into these three elements, we have lost the state of pure consciousness. Therefore, one must be alert at all times in order to not get absorbed into illusion.\n\nIs it possible to be in the state of pure consciousness at all times? Yes, it is. Even if you have been in this state for one moment, you will know when others are in this state. You can meet people who are in this state continuously. These people are usually recognized as enlightened people, but there are people in this state that are not recognized as well.\n\nThroughout history, the experience of pure consciousness has been termed as “self realization.” Self realization is a spontaneous happening, despite some people trying their whole lives to attain it. It is a spontaneous happening due to its unconditional state. Someone can get self realization by watching cars go by, and on the other hand, by doing something traditional like penance. The only thing required is the pure desire to realize one’s true self. No one can be forced into having their self realization. If one is forced into getting self realization, without personal consent or desire, it will not be achieved.\n\nIf your desire to achieve self realization is strong enough, it can outweigh the negativity you hold onto. But, it does help before trying to get self realization to let go of your past. The past is finished and in a sense, you are born anew each moment. The history of your identity is a story you continually tell yourself and others. With each moment, that history is obsolete, as you have to face the present. Each moment is a choice: either to be in objective reality or not–whether to be the consciousness that watches the play of existence in self-contentedness, or to be a slave of your senses.\n\nWhen following and being absorbed in our subjective existence, we can feel pleasure for a few moments, but not a continual satisfaction. This is because if we run our lives on gaining sense pleasures, we will have a period when we do not have the opportunity to have the pleasures we want, or we will grow tired of the pleasures we have.\n\nAlso, the more we focus on sense pleasures, the more dissatisfied we are. This is due to getting further and further away from the continual satisfaction that is pure consciousness. Some people get to a breaking point where they have indulged so much in mundane pleasures that they feel like renouncing pleasures altogether. They become tired of seeking satisfaction in something temporary and addicting. The state of pure consciousness, on the other hand, does not give pleasure in bursts and fits. It is a subtle, balanced state of sustained contentment. All problems arise in a dualistic reality, and since it is without a sense of identity or separation, the state of pure consciousness contains only peace–a complete sobriety that carries no worries with it.\n\nTo be in this state at all times is not the easiest thing. Usually, people who get in this state swing in and out of subjective existence and objective existence. But even getting into the state of pure consciousness only once per day can have a profound impact on one’s life. Once you touch that reality, for whatever duration, it changes your view of mundane life. But first, the initial experience of it, self realization, needs to be achieved.\n\nDespite the process of self realization being spontaneous, there is a method we can use to allow pure consciousness to enter into our lives: 1) have a pure desire to get self realization 2) affirm that pure consciousness is the reality 3) and to ask for self realization.\n\nIn this method, we use our own body as a tool to allow pure consciousness to be realized. In order to go above our physical state, we need to use our physical state as a stepping stone. We have not experienced the state of pure consciousness yet, so we must start with what we know: our physical self.\n\nFirst, ensure you have a desire to achieve self realization. If you feel a desire to know objective reality and to go beyond subjective reality, then you are ready to get self realization.\n\nDuring the process of self realization, we use our hands. The right hand is used to do actions, as it relates to the side of our nervous system that is responsible for action. Our left hand is placed on our lap, with the palm open. The left hand corresponds to the left side of our nervous system, which relates to desire. Therefore, we are leaving our left hand open to express our desire for self realization. The right hand is placed first on the area of the heart and then on the top of the head. When we want to make a declaration of truth or want to show our honesty, it is a common gesture to put our hand on the heart. So, when we place our hand on our heart, we affirm that pure consciousness is the reality–not our thoughts, emotions, or bodily sensations. When we put our hand on top of our head, we are recognizing that reality is beyond our mind. While placing our hand on top of our head, we ask for our self realization.\n\nAfter the process of self realization is done, it is common to feel a subtle, cool breeze flowing from our hands and above our head. This is the sign that we have gone beyond our subjective self and that the reality, the pure consciousness, is now flowing through us. When we are engaged in our thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations, the flow of energy will subside. But as soon we reenter the state of pure consciousness, the energy will flow once again.\n\nFeeling this energy is only possible after getting self realization. It is your guide to know what state you are in and what state other people are in. After self realization, through the changes in the energy flowing from your hands and the top of your head, you will know what is constructive and destructive. Whatever you experience as constructive, the energy will flow. Whatever you experience as destructive, the energy will lessen, heat up, or stop altogether. Through this energy, you can guide yourself and others towards a constructive life.###"}
{"prompt":"What were some of the most significant scientific and technological breakthroughs of 2015?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If you watch science-fiction films produced in the 1970s or 1980s, you will most likely decide that that were naive and somewhat absurd in their predictions about the future. Video chats, cell phones, electric cars, lasers, touchscreen panels, portable computers, and other technological wonders have become so common that many people nowadays do not even pay attention to them. Perhaps, in another 20 or 30 years, our current concepts regarding the future will also seem naive to future generations, especially considering the wonders that contemporary science introduces almost every day. For example, 2015 was a year especially rich with scientific and technological breakthroughs.\n\nPerhaps one of the most significant discoveries—for the field of artificial intelligence and cybernetics, so for science in general—was made by Selmer Bringsjord, a professor of computer science and cognitive science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. He conducted an experiment with the purpose of figuring out how machines can be capable of being self-aware. For this purpose, Dr. Bringsjord used three programmable NAO Robots, who recently led an experiment with three programmable NAO Robots, in hopes of showing that these humanoid machines can be self-aware.\n\nAccording to Luciano Floridi, a professor of philosophy from Oxford University, in order to be recognized as self-understanding, a robot must be able to know it exists, be able to state this fact using the personal pronoun “I” without preceding programming, and to know what to do about it. Bringsjord’s experiment is a response to these requirements. He used three robots of the same model that were able to speak; however, two of them were programmed to remain silent. Then all three robots were told they were given a “dumbing pill” that makes them silent, and asked them to figure out which of them could talk. The results were amazing: the only speaking robot said that it did not know the answer. However, after a short pause, it said: “Sorry, I know now. I was able to prove that I was not given a dumbing pill,” thus not only demonstrating its ability to analyze the situation, but also to understand its involvement in it, and to teach itself new behaviors based on analysis (CS Monitor).\n\nAs if self-aware robots are not amazing enough, it seems that human beings are getting closer to integrating mechanic parts into their biological bodies. Prosthetics nowadays have turned from imperfect and clumsy substitutes of real limbs to advanced and convenient tools of interacting with the world. In particular, the American DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has recently introduced a cybernetic prosthetic arm which can successfully imitate the sense of touch, returning tactile feelings to their owners. This prosthetic arm can be connected to a person’s nervous system, thus not only solving the problem of sensibility, but also allowing one’s brain to control the prosthetic directly. The arm was tested on a young man under 30 years old who was paralyzed for more than a decade. DARPA engineers wired the arm’s electrodes to the man’s motor and sensory centers; as a result, he became able to control the arm in the same way people usually move their natural limbs. The sensibility of the prosthetic arm was high enough to allow the young man to feel when his artificial fingers were touched with almost 100% accuracy.\n\n“At one point, instead of pressing one finger, the team decided to press two without telling him. He responded in jest asking whether somebody was trying to play a trick on him. That is when we knew that the feelings he was perceiving through the robotic hand were near-natural. Prosthetic limbs that can be controlled by thoughts are showing great promise, but without feedback from signals traveling back to the brain, it can be difficult to achieve the level of control needed to perform precise movements,” said Justin Sanchez, DARPA program manager who participated in the experiment (The Guardian). If such research continues, physical disabilities will probably disappear in the nearest decades.\n\nYet another technological solution that might revolutionize our daily lives could be the ultra-new solar panels. However, it would be more correct to say “solar cells” rather than panels, because they are flexible and as thin as a sheet of regular paper; in addition, they can be printed on a 3D printer, which makes their production cheaper than regular solar panels. Solar cells’ efficiency has risen 20% throughout the recent years, and it is likely they will successfully substitute more habitual alternative sources of energy.\n\n“I’ve witnessed firsthand how the technology has enabled urban poor communities in India to access off-grid electricity. Its success is due to its cost effectiveness and simplicity. A 10×10 cm solar cell film is enough to generate as much as 10-50 watts per square meter,” says Scott Watkins of Korean firm Kyung-In Synthetic that develops solar cells (Inhabitat). Together with other inventions in the field of producing and conserving power such as Tesla products, solar cells might soon change the world as we know it.\n\n2015 was a year of incredible scientific and technological discoveries. Some of them were true wonders; for example, a self-aware robot, and a prosthetic arm connected to the human brain and returning the sense of touch to a disabled person. Paper-thin foldable solar panels developed by a Korean company Kyung-In Synthetic also has bright horizons. However, despite how important and fascinating these wonders are, they do not make even 1% of technological and scientific breakthroughs made during the previous year.###"}

Although a significant part of them is meant solely for entertainment and possess little-to-no artistic value, there are also movies in which actors’ performance, plot, camera work, atmosphere, and other components are so brilliant that they deserve to be awarded. In the beginning of the 20th century, such an award had been established; nowadays known as the Oscar Award, it has become a mass culture event year by year throughout almost a century.\n\nThe Oscar Awards ceremony was initiated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), formed in 1927 with the goal to honor talented actors, directors, cameramen, and other people involved in the cinema industry. The first president of the Academy was Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., a famous actor back then, and the first ceremony of awarding was held on May, 1929 at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Surprisingly, the initial ceremony was a rather private event, with only a little over a hundred people being invited, and with the price for tickets equaling only $5. Originally, there were 12 categories and two special honors, and there was no intrigue in the ceremony itself: the names of all the winners were announced in advance, and the ceremony itself served only for handing out the awards and for the banquet. The first actor who received an Oscar statue was the German actor Emil Jannings; the first best actress was Janet Gaynor, who acted in such films as “Sunrise,” “Seventh Heaven,” and “Street Angel” (Awards & Shows).\n\nThe award itself—meaning the statue, which the Oscar event is usually associated with—does not look impressive. To start with, its name is not Oscar; officially it is called “The Academy Award of Merit,” and “Oscar” is a nickname. It is 13.5 inches tall, and weighs about 8.5 pounds. The statue stands on five spokes, which symbolize the basics of the Academy: screenplay writers, producers, technicians, actors, and directors. Initially, the statuettes were made of solid gold-plated bronze, and a bit later, from the alloy of nickel, copper, and 24-karat gold, known as britannia metal; during the years of World War II, statuettes were even made of painted plaster, but this only lasted for three years. Nowadays, the Oscar is traditionally made of gold-covered metal (Oscars.org)\n\nAt the same time, despite its cultural value, an Oscar statue is incredibly cheap—it costs only $1. If an actor or another award nominee wanted, for some reason, to sell his or her Oscar statuette, they are obliged to sell it only to the Academy, for the estimated price of $1. Such practice has been enabled since 1950, and every winner announces whether he or she wants to keep or to sell the statuette. In 1989, the heirs of a producer Mike Todd wanted to sell the Oscar statuette he received for his movie “Around the World in 80 Days,” but the Academy successfully blocked the deal. However, those Oscars that were awarded before 1950 can be sold and bought freely; for example, the statuette received by Orson Welles for “Citizen Kane” was sold in 2011 for $861,542 (The Hollywood Reporter).\n\nThe Academy Award of Merit, most often referred to as an Oscar, is a sign of acknowledgement of actors, directors, and other people related to the process of producing a movie, for their contributions and talents. The ceremony originated in 1927, when it was a private event for the chosen few; however, it has gradually become one of the main annual events in world culture. The statue itself is made of gold-plated metal, and despite its cultural value, it can be sold for only $1 due to the rules established by the Academy. Despite this selling price, the Oscar is the most highly recognized award in film.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of drinking Coca-Cola?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What is the most popular non-alcoholic drink in the world, after tea? Coca-Cola. Wherever you go to, you will see commercials advertising it; whatever fast-food restaurant you drop in to, Coca-Cola (or Pepsi, which is practically the same regardless of what numerous advertisements claim) will be included into the majority of menus. Children and adults all over the world drink Coca-Cola. It is promoted as a harmless energy drink, and it is associated with holidays and fun—just remember all those Christmas commercials on TV. Considering such popularity, it is important to know what this drink consists of; unfortunately, unlike what marketers and manufacturers try to persuade us in, Coca-Cola is not harmless.\n\nLet us first take a look at how drinking Coca-Cola affects our bodies, and then move onto analyzing the ingredients causing certain destructive effects. So, approximately ten minutes after drinking a can of this drink, it delivers about twice as large as the recommended dose of sugar to your body; some of the ingredients dissolve the intense sweetness so that a consumer does not feel nauseous. Within ten more minutes, due to the increased level of sugar in blood, the levels of the hormone called insulin rise dramatically, which in its turn causes the liver to transform the surplus of sugar into fats. In 40-45 minutes, a consumer’s blood pressure rises due to the absorption of the caffeine contained in Coca-Cola; adenosine, which is a natural suppressor of the central nervous system, gets blocked from the brain receptors, which causes an individual to feel an increase in mood. In about an hour after a person drinks a can of Coca-Cola, their metabolism fires up as the drink’s ingredients combine with calcium, magnesium, and zinc in the large intestine, and the diuresis causes them to urinate more often. This, in its turn, leads to dehydration and deprives the body from electrolytes, which it needs for nutrition (Tech Times).\n\nAll the aforementioned effects are caused by a crazy mix of chemicals; many of them, if consumed in pure form, can be dangerous to one’s health. Perhaps the least harmful among them is carbonated water, citric acid, food coloring, and assorted aromas. For example, citric acid, or E330, is a common food preservative widely used in many products; E150D, a food coloring, is also safe. However, other ingredients are more dangerous, though. Orthophosphoric acid contained in Coca-Cola in significant quantities, in its pure form, is so corrosive that it is stored and transported in special containers, because regular containers become easily corroded by it. When it gets inside one’s body, it causes bone density problems, in particular osteoporosis; it can also negatively affect one’s eyes and cause painful skin rashes. Sodium benzoate, or E211, is another typical Coca-Cola ingredient; it is known to be able to cause allergic reactions, especially among people who are allergic to aspirin or who have asthma. Sodium benzoate can make one’s asthma worse in several seconds. It leads to the cirrhosis of the liver; research conducted in Sheffield University in the United Kingdom showed that sodium benzoate can somehow deactivate certain segments of the human DNA, which can lead to such frightening conditions as Parkinson’s disease and other diseases that are associated with it (Thought Pursuits).\n\nSodium cyclamate, another ingredient, is so dangerous that it has even become impossible to find it in Coca-Cola sold in the U.S.—it has been excluded from the list of components after, in 1969, the FDA discovered that sodium cyclamate caused bladder cancer among rats. According to researchers, sodium cyclamate can be transformed into a highly venomous cyclohexylamine by bacteria that live in human intestines. Still, this chemical can be found in Coke Zero—a popular drink in Italy, Germany, Chile, Spain, and some other countries. The inclusion of this ingredient in soda drinks caused protests among consumers in Mexico, which resulted into the exclusion of sodium cyclamate from the Coca-Cola sold in this country in 2008. Later research showed there is little-to-no evidence that sodium cyclamate is able to cause cancer among other species of mammals; however, the FDA has not revised its decision (Mic.com).\n\nAspartame, or E951, also contained in Coca-Cola drinks, is a substitute for sugar. It is used for the sake of people with diabetes, since they cannot afford consuming regular sugar, and the drink manufacturers strive to reach a larger audience; however, this substitute is highly unstable chemically, and if the temperature rises, it becomes methanol and phenylalanine (probably, this is the reason why it is recommended to drink Coca-Cola cold). The danger is that methanol can lead to irreversible blindness due to the destruction of an optic nerve—5 to 10 milligrams of this substance are usually enough. Aspartame also converts into formaldehyde, a strong carcinogen. There is even such a disease as aspartame poisoning; its symptoms include memory loss, blurred vision, headache, dizziness, fainting, nausea, and so on. This ingredient can easily lead to multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, and epilepsy; this is not to mention mental diseases including Alzheimer’s, and tuberculosis (Why Don’t You Try This).\n\nAs it turns out, Coca-Cola is not such a happy drink as it is being advertised. On the contrary, because of several incredibly dangerous ingredients contained in it, this drink can easily ruin one’s health, and even cause life-threatening conditions. In particular, Coca-Cola causes dehydration and washes out electrolytes from the human body; its ingredients such as orthophosphoric acid and sodium cyclamate can lead to problems with bones, or cause cancer (at least among the rats on which it was tested), and aspartame—a seemingly harmless sugar substitute—can lead to brain tumors and Alzheimer’s. One should consider all this when drinking Coca-Cola.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of the Zika virus?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Every year, international media outlets launch new informational campaigns dedicated to new diseases—usually viral—that are expected to threaten the health of people all over the world. Throughout the recent decade, newspapers and websites around Europe and the U.S. informed the public about the Siberian plague, the H1N1 flu, atypical pneumonia, the Ebola virus, and other threats—the news about which causes stress in common people. 2016 has not become an exception in these terms, and this week, the WHO has announced a new danger: the Zika virus. Let us take a look at what it is exactly.\n\nThe Zika virus is an endemic microorganism in Africa and Asia; it is related to a group of viruses named flaviviruses and is connected to the dengue virus. The Zika virus is usually transmitted by mosquitoes; initially, it was retrieved from monkeys and Aedes africanus mosquitoes inhabiting the Zika forest in Uganda in 1947; in humans, this virus was first discovered in 1954 in Nigeria. In the South Pacific, it was first identified in 2007 after an outbreak on Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia (WHO).\n\nOne of the features of the virus posing difficulties for its diagnostics is that only one out of four people bitten by an infection-transmitting mosquito develops any symptoms; most often, symptoms include skin rashes, conjunctivitis, mild fever, and muscle and\/or joint pain that begins approximately 2-7 days after contamination (PAHO). As a rule, adults deal with the disease easily; however, there is a not-so obvious danger: the most affected victims of the Zika virus are pregnant women. Transmitting the virus to an unborn baby may have dramatic consequences: the Zika virus is known to cause severe fetal birth defects and poor pregnancy outcomes (health.govt.nz).\n\nCurrently, there is no cure for the Zika virus. The best way to deal with it is to have a lot of rest, drink water and tea to prevent dehydration, and take acetaminophen or other pain-relieving medicines (mind, however, that aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen are not recommended to use in case of a Zika virus infection). As a general precaution measure, avoid mosquito bites while sick, and make sure to not pass the virus to people around you (CDC).\n\nThe Zika virus is not a new disease: it was first discovered in 1954 in Nigeria. However, the panic around it has begun only in 2016. It is mostly characterized by mild fever, weakness, pain in muscles, and conjunctivitis; the symptoms last up to 7 days, but only one out of four infected develops any of them. However, the main danger of the Zika virus lies in the effects in has on pregnant women and their babies: if transmitted to an embryo, the virus can cause severe defects in a baby’s development. Considering this, the Zika virus demands strong attention from healthcare organizations.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the difference between autism and other mental conditions?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" About a century ago, people with noticeable mental deprivations were mostly considered ill, and placed in asylums. Nowadays, when psychologists know much more about different mental conditions, not all of the peculiar mental conditions are considered dangerous, or become a cause for psychiatric treatment. At the same time, not all of these conditions are identified as illnesses—many remain a mystery, or require additional scrutiny. One of such conditions is autism.\n\nIn fact, autism—or more accurately, autism spectrum disorders—is a complex of disorders that occurs during brain development. All of them are united by a relative similarity of symptoms, such as social dysadaptation, difficulties with verbal communication, the lack of empathy or emotional expression, repetitive behaviors, and so on. According to the recent (in 2013) update to the DSM-5 diagnostic manual, all diagnoses related to autism, such as autistic disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder, were united under the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (Autism Speaks).\n\nThe period during which ASD usually develops is considered to be between the first and the third years of a child’s life. According to the statistics, this is a more frequent condition than it was believed before; in 1943, when ASD had been first described, one of 2,000 children was considered to have autism. Nowadays, however, scientists consider that ASD or autism-related conditions can be observed in one out of only 68 children; besides, there is up to a 20% chance that a second child in a family will have autism—given that the first one already has one of the ASDs (UCSD).\n\nDespite the decades of research studies in this field, it is still difficult to name what exactly causes autistic development; what experts agree about is that it might result from more than just a single cause. Numerous evidence shows that autism is caused by a complex of physical factors—not by emotional traumas or mistreatment in childhood—that affect brain development. Some forms of autism may have genetic origins; recent studies have been aimed at determining which genes are responsible for the development of ASD. The main difficulty here is that autism is most likely determined by the ways genes interact with each other, and the ways a child is affected by his or her environment; therefore, there is no genetic testing allowing to diagnose a child’s pre-disposition to developing ASD (NAS).\n\nSymptoms of autism-related disorders are well known: undeveloped social behavior and difficulties with social adaptation (up to complete isolation from one’s society); delayed or in some other way impaired cognition; severely limited interests—an autist shows interest only towards a small part of the world around him or her, sometimes completely ignoring the rest of it; repetitive or ritual behavior; language abnormalities (such as echolalia—repeating once heard words for hours a long time after they were heard) and so on (UCSD). At the same time, many autistic persons possess talents not commonly found in regular people: for example, they can be brilliant mathematicians, or have photographic memory—like Stephen Wiltshire, who created an extremely detailed painted panorama of New York City after seeing it just once.\n\nAccording to statistics, one out of 68 children has ASD-related symptoms, so the amount of autistic people around us is much higher than expected. However, even though some symptoms such as repetitive behaviors, limited interests, language difficulties, or social dysadaptation can intervene in normal social interactions, they do not necessarily prevent an autistic person from living a normal life, especially with the help of other people. This is also proved by the fact that you might run into several people with ASD during your regular Sunday shopping without even realizing it.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the reasons why teenagers might join gangs?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Adolescence is one of the most difficult and turbulent periods of life for both parents and their children. During their transit from childhood to adult life, teenagers seek to self-identify and try to find their place in the world; they learn to interact with their society, adopt social norms, and define their life priorities. Unfortunately, this process is not always smooth. Some teenagers experiment with substances, and some get involved in illegal activities. One of the biggest problems a teenager can get into during adolescence is becoming a part of a teenage gang.\n\nWhy would a teenager even want to join a gang? Experts believe it might be connected to a desire to gain authority and respect in the teenage society hierarchy: gangs usually attract adolescents who want to belong to a respected community that provides security and anonymity, and at the same time tend to be susceptible to peer pressure. Dr. Kenneth Sladkin, a child and adolescent psychiatrist in the Fort Lauderdale area, says that despite the high numbers of teens in gangs, the majority of them still do not accept criminal group standards: of the estimated eight hundred thousand gang members in the United States, the majority of their teenage members rather might be described as criminal “wannabes.” “For these kids, the gangs are almost like social clubs. They meet in school and talk about who’s in this gang or that gang. They’re not the youngsters who are staying out all night and getting mixed up in crime and turf wars,” believes Dr. Sladkin (HealthyChildren).\n\nDoes it mean the problem of teenagers participating in gangs is not worth attention? No. The percentage of actual criminals among teens is still high; besides, even passive participation in a gang (like described by Dr. Sladkin) still increases the chances that a teenager will become entangled in drugs (addiction or trafficking), vandalism, theft, and robbery (HealthyChildren). What is even more disturbing, even if a teenager quits a gang, the likelihood of him or her getting involved in illegal affairs in adulthood remains high. According to research, teenagers who joined a gang in adolescence had three times higher chances to receive illegal incomes between ages 27 and 33. This means that even if a teenager does not commit a crime now, he or she will do it later. Besides, even if they are not committing crimes, former gang members are at a three-times higher risk of developing substance addictions in a later age; they are also twice as likely to have poor health and be in need of receiving public assistance. This is not to mention a significantly lower likelihood of successfully graduating from school (University of Washington).\n\nFor those parents concerned about whether their child might become a member of a gang, there is a set of criteria regarding a child’s behavior and\/or appearance to pay attention to; if at least some of the following is true in your case, you can suspect your child of being a member of a gang:\n\nJoining a gang might be an extreme way of teenage riot; adolescence is the time when teenagers seek to establish themselves in a social hierarchy, and being a part of a gang might seem a considerable option for them. Although not all teenagers in gangs become criminals and commit crimes (mostly they are “wannabe criminals”), being a member of a gang can still lead to problems later: including substance abuse, poor health, getting involved in illegal activities, and so on. Usually, if your child has problems at school and with police, wears specific colors of symbols all the time, possesses a lot of money from unclear sources, and hides their activities from you, he or she might be a part of a gang.###"}
{"prompt":"How does music affect the human brain?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is a well-known fact that listening to different kinds of music can evoke various feelings and moods in a listener. For example, listening to pop music can make one energetic or cheerful, and listening to ambient or lounge melodies can calm a person down. However, the most outstanding in this aspect is classical music, which is capable of—as numerous studies have shown—making people smarter.\n\nResearch aimed at revealing the connection between music and cognitive processes started in the 20th century, when in 1988, neurobiologists Gordon Shaw and Xiaodan Leng attempted to model brain activity on a computer. Scientists discovered nerve cells, connected to each other in certain ways, formed specific patterns that might be responsible for the basic exchange of mental activity. Instead of a regular printout, they, for some reason, decided to turn the results of their experiments into sounds; surprisingly, they discovered the output was a rhythmic pattern of sounds, somewhat similar to music. Shaw thought if brain activity can sound like music, it might be possible to learn more about the mechanisms of its work through observing how brain reacts to music. He joined two other researchers, Frances Rauscher and Katherine Ky, and together they conducted a fundamental study, revealing what is now called the “Mozart Effect” (lrs.ed.uiuc.edu).\n\nWithin the process of the experiment, subjects were suggested to listen to Mozart’s sonata written for two pianos (K448) for 10 minutes. After this period, the participants of the experiment displayed higher spatial reasoning skills, compared to periods of listening to specially designed “relaxing” music. This effect did not last longer than 15 minutes, and the same effect was not always achieved by other investigators; still, the majority of experiments proved that Mozart’s sonata K448 caused an increase in spatial-temporal performance—however, without enhancing general intelligence (JRSM).\n\nResearch in this field continues. Recently, researchers have located specific areas of mental activity linked to emotional responses to music. “You can activate different parts of the brain, depending on what music you listen to. So music can stimulate parts of the brain that are under-active in neurological diseases or a variety of emotional disorders. Over time, we could retrain the brain in these disorders,” says neuroscientist Anne Blood at McGill University in Montreal (How to Learn).\n\nNumerous research studies have proved that music definitely affects the way the human brain works, increasing its performance in certain circumstances and under certain conditions. Especially famous in this relation is the “Mozart Effect,” which manifests itself in a temporary boost of spatial reasoning skills. Although general intelligence is not affected by the music one listens to, neurobiologists say it might be possible to deal with certain neurological diseases with the help of music.###"}
{"prompt":"How can you best prevent or resolve a conflict?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Life often requires people to participate in unpleasant situations. Being able to deal with daily stresses, deadlines, loads of work, and personal flaws is an essential part of being human in the modern world. Rather often, these unpleasant situations do not occur on their own, but rather happen because of other people’s actions and words. Social interactions often imply conflict. There is nothing bad about this; however, many people still tend to see conflicts as something bothersome and difficult. Fortunately, there are ways to solve conflicts in productive ways.\n\nThe best way to solve a conflict is to not let it happen. This may sound controversial, but conflict prevention is indeed the best way not only to eliminate points of collision, but also to develop a mutually-beneficial point of view (or course of action) before the difference in views grows into conflict. To prevent a conflict, you should take a conscious and proactive position, seeking out areas of potential conflicts (Forbes). To do this, you will need to learn the points of view your potential opponents share and the benefits of understanding people around you. Time spent seeking out threatening tensions will help you avoid unnecessary conflict—even if the conflict flares up, your preventive effort will most likely minimize it.\n\nIf the conflict has already arisen, one of the best strategies to resolve disagreements is to treat the situation with humor. It does not mean, however, you must ignore your opponent’s arguments and make jokes about them; it means you should sustain a friendly atmosphere, saying serious and difficult-to-express things with a bit of humor. Humor will help you discharge anger, reduce tension, reframe problems to make them look easier to solve, and set your opponent’s mind to working on a problem with you, not against you. Just remember that you should laugh with your opponent, not at them. This way, a conflict can become an opportunity for establishing a greater connection and intimacy between you and your opponent (HelpGuide).\n\nHowever, if you are already engaged in a conflict and there is no obvious way out of it, remember some rules that will help you minimize danger. One rule is that any physical or verbal abuse is never acceptable, no matter how intense and personal a conflict gets. You should also abstain from personal criticism (attacking psychological and\/or physical features of your opponent); ignoring the opponent altogether (“shutting down”); nonverbal hostility (such as “eye-rolling”), and making yourself a victim of your opponent (Huffington Post). These are the conventional rules of engaging in a conflict; following them, you can significantly contribute to the solution of a complicated situation.\n\nAs we can see, conflicts can be approached differently. If you perceive a conflict only as a source of problems, it may be hard for you to solve; however, if you approach a conflict with a sense of humor, and stick to certain psychological rules, you can minimize your psychological “losses,” and even come to a beneficial result. And remember: the best way to solve a conflict is to prevent it.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the problem with slang language?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Exchanging text messages online is one of the most popular forms of communication around the world. People send billions of messages every day using emails, social media networks, mobile applications, and so on. The daily amounts of messages, as well as the valued speed of information exchange, has led to the development of digital slang—usually abbreviations or contractions of words used in communication most often. And although many people do not see the problem in slang language, there is an opinion that it can pose a threat to literacy.\n\nSlang is a specific category of conventional language used by a relatively small group of people who share situations or interests. It consists of words and phrases that cannot be found in regular dictionaries, but possess real meaning and are used to efficiently convey information; slang words and phrases can be either completely made up, or based on existing linguistic constructions (Boston University).\n\nAmong the most common digital slang terms and expressions are well-known abbreviations used in electronic messaging: “bb” (bye-bye), “brb” (be right back), “lol” (laughing out loud), “idk” (I don’t know), “smh” (shaking my head), “c u m8” (see you, mate), “btw” (by the way), “u2” (you too), and so on. Although it may seem convenient to use such distortions in order to accelerate communication, in fact slang overuse poses a problem; nowadays, this can be most often noticed in the academic environment. Slang is common among students, and unfortunately it has moved from online communication to student assignments.\n\nAccording to a study involving around 700 students between the ages of 12 to 17, 85% of them are actively using at least one form of electronic communication, whether through instant messaging, text messaging, or social media. Terry Wood, a foreign language teacher at St. Mary’s Ryken High School in Leonardtown, Md., believes that Twitter and Facebook are among the reasons of a great decline of students’ writing abilities. “They do not capitalize words or use punctuation anymore […] Even in emails to teachers or [on] writing assignments, any word longer than one syllable is now abbreviated to one,” says Terry Wood (U.S.News).\n\nAt the same time, not all of the experts believe slang is negatively affecting linguistic and writing capabilities. Slang expert Tony Thorne thinks slang is an appropriate part of the English language. “The very nature of the English language—and what it means to be British—is its flexibility […] A long time ago, slang was about work. Market workers, carpenters, public houses, farmers had their own slang […] All groups—it doesn’t matter whether they are soldiers, policeman, criminals or whatever—always generate to some extent their own language. It’s not just to communicate information, it’s in order to include people into your group and exclude people out of your group […] Slang has not become more prevalent, simply more public,” says Tony Thorne (BBC News).\n\nIt is hard to deny that slang has become a part of everyday communication. It is convenient for quickly exchanging messages in the environment of the Internet; slang can also be a part of professional, cultural, or other subculture. At the same time, young people tend to use slang words in inappropriate situations (in an academic environment, for example), which, as some specialists believe, negatively affects their communication and writing capabilities. So, slang should be used where it belongs—within informal and\/or small groups of people, sharing the same situations, occupations, or interests.###"}
{"prompt":"What psychological mechanisms underlie the correlation between colors and human behavior?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Every year, psychologists make amazing discoveries about the ways the human brain works. Throughout decades of research, specialists have revealed numerous correlations between an individual’s behavior and ways of thinking, and their childhood, environment, relationship with parents and peers, gender, significant events, and many other factors. One of such discoveries is the influence of color on the human mind—in particular, on the decision-making process. This influence turned out to be so significant that companies all over the world started to pay color a lot more attention when developing brands and introducing products on the global market.\n\nScience has provided numerous confirmations to this thesis. For instance, a study called “Impact of Color in Marketing” reveals that the first impression a customer makes about a product is based on the product’s color in 90% of cases. Another research study, “The Interactive Effects of Colors” shows that purchasing significantly depends on whether the color fits the brand or the product; in other words, colors define characteristics that customers subconsciously imbue products with. According to a number of additional studies, a brand’s recognizability depends on the colors used, which makes them extremely important for the process of brand development and creating brand identity (Entrepreneur). Considering this, it becomes clear why many famous brands keep using the same colors in their logos and design for decades; Pepsi, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Apple, Microsoft (the Windows OS logo, in particular), FedEx—not only they have developed recognizable symbols, but also made certain colors an inalienable part of their corporate style.\n\nPsychological mechanisms underlying this correlation are rather interesting. The human brain identifies colors as informational clusters, each conveying its own message. Warm, bright colors, for example, such as orange, red, yellow, or beige, are active and eye-catching; they are perceived as friendly and energetic, and may motivate customers to enact certain behaviors. For example, it is known that orange and red, apart from their other properties, can increase appetite; this is why many fast-food restaurants use these colors in decor and logos. Cold bright colors, such as silver or azure, are calmer, and are commonly associated with aesthetics and freshness. They are often associated with professionalism, rationalism, and harmony; brands willing to emphasize these characteristics often use cold, bright colors in their designs. A lot of companies in the health industry and commerce use cold tones. Warm darker colors such as brown, dark-gold appeal to status, classics, and luxury. These colors are often associated with expensive products aimed at highlighting the social and financial status of a customer. Cold, dark colors (blue, green, navy), in their turn, provide the feeling of stability and high quality, which is the reason why scientific, governmental, and financial organizations use them in their designs so often. Finally, neutral colors—grey, black, and white—are used to compliment other color combinations (Blurgroup).\n\nBrands all over the world have become keen on using colors to convey complex messages to their customers. For example, Japan Airlines (JAL) communicates an image of a powerful, authentically Japanese transportation airline, and wishes its customers good luck during the flight. How? The logo of JAL consists of several components: a red bird in a white circle. The bird is an easily recognizable symbol of flight; at the same time, in many Asian countries, red is considered to be the symbol of luck and wealth. The red color on the white field resembles Japan’s national flag. Altogether, these elements form a clear message to customers. Another prime example is the UPS (United Parcel Service) brand image design; it is brown, which resembles traditions and solidity. The shield creates an additional feeling of dependability, and the company’s name illustrated in its golden color communicates additional reliability (Color Matters).\n\nIt can be seen that colors are used in branding for a solid reason. Studies show that the majority of customers are influenced by a brand’s coloring when deciding whether to buy or not to buy a certain product. Subconsciously, customers imbue brands with certain characteristics, based on the colors companies use in their designs; therefore, for brands, it is crucial to communicate their messages to customers clearly by using appropriate colors.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the most intriguing species discovered in 2015?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Ecology activists nowadays often claim that humanity is causing hundreds of species to go extinct; they use disappearing rhinos, crocodiles, or monkeys as examples of such extinction. Unfortunately, they seem to forget about animals of smaller sizes—it is hard to remember when activists panicked about ants, worms, or ticks, for example. At the same time, our planet is so big, and nature is so diverse, that scientists keep discovering hundreds of new species every year. It is just that some of them are not large or cute enough to draw the attention of activists; however, this does not make these species less interesting from the scientific perspective.\n\nOne of the most intriguing findings made by biologists in 2015 is probably the X-Phyla, or Dendrogramma Enigmatica. These are small sea animals; its shape reminds of a mushroom, with a stalk 8mm in length, and an 11mm cap on it. X-Phyla is a multicellular animal related to jellyfish, corals, sea anemones, and comb jellies. Generally, they look like fossils from the Precambrian era, reminding of trilobites and probably being a kind of a living fossil; the specimen was found on the sea floor at a depth of about 3,200 feet near Point Hicks in Australia (ESF).\n\nAnother intriguing species discovered this year is Deuteragenia Ossarium, or the bone-house wasp. One would probably say their habits are rather creepy; females of this small Chinese species of wasps have developed a unique way of taking care of their offspring. First, a wasp carves a hole in a stem of a plant, and puts a dead spider in it; after it, the wasp stuffs a dead spider with an egg. The dead spider becomes a source of food for the wasp’s larvae. The hole is sealed with soil, so the larvae are safe inside. The wasp, however, does not stop and keeps carving holes, placing spiders, and laying eggs in them until the whole stem is full of the wasp’s offspring. Then, the wasp plants some dead ants onto the top of the stem: these ants emit a toxin that repels potential predators and helps keep its babies safe when they are ready to hatch. Considering the amount of dead insects the bone-house wasp uses, it is clear how it has gotten its name (Earth Touch News).\n\nAmong the larger species, scientists have recently identified a new specimen of giant tortoise on the Galapagos Islands—specifically, on Santa Cruz island; in general, it is the 15th known tortoise species discovered on this archipelago. Tortoises here tend to weigh up to 250kg, and live more than 100 years. There were two populations of giant tortoises on Santa Cruz island, and for a long period of time, biologists thought they were two big groups of the same species, but recent DNA testing proved that they belonged to two different species. The new species, the Eastern Santa Cruz Tortoise, possesses a shell of a more compressed shape compared to other species and inhabits a different area of the island. The estimated population of tortoises on the archipelago is about just 250 animals, so ecologists hope the recent discovery will help protect them (BBC).\n\nThese are just three of the great amount of species discovered this year. Each of them is unique, and altogether they prove that nature is much more diverse and mysterious than one might judge by only watching the Animal Planet channel. A tiny living fossil X-Phyla from Australia, a hideous bone-house wasp from China, a surprisingly unknown-before specimen of tortoise—all of them do not represent even a small part of all the species discovered in 2015. And what about the following years? For sure, nature has a lot more surprises in store for biologists.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the two main types of downshifters?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Living in a fast-paced world requires an individual to spend colossal amounts of energy every day. A regular western person spends a lot of time being in traffic jams (which is even worse for those who do not own a car), works in an air-conditioned office for at least eight hours a day, is in traffic jams again to get home, pays numerous loans, taxes, and so on. This is stressful, and not all people can withstand such pressure every day. Therefore, some of them choose an alternative way of life: they quit their jobs or businesses or at least decrease the amount of daily work, move away from big cities to rural areas, or sometimes change their occupations dramatically. This is called life downshifting, and recently this movement has been steadily gaining popularity around the world.\n\nLet us take a closer look at a downshifter. Who is he or she? Regardless of gender, a downshifter is generally a person who prefers the quality of his or her personal life over material goods, career, and other popular values. A downshifter may voluntarily reduce his or her work hours—meaning he or she also gives up a significant sum of his or her salary—in order to have more time for family, friends, hobbies, or other occupations; a downshifter may also choose to limit his or her consumption in order to save more money. Sometimes such people even quit their jobs, change companies, careers, or even specialties and occupations in general, if the amount of stress they  deal with are too much for them to withstand (HubPages).\n\nThere are two main types of downshifters, if any classification can be applied in this case: downscalers, and mold melters (Yowusa.com). Downscalers are those who want to slow down: they decide to work less, earn less, and stress out less as well. In turn, mold melters are more radical: they want to break out of corporate culture. Whereas downscalers do not mind working in companies and\/or businesses and seek for a more relaxed pace, mold melters are, generally speaking, those people who quit their positions and move to rural areas to live off the land.\n\nDownscaling is a sort of rational revision of a person’s consumption rates, a reevaluation of what a person earns and consumes. Rather often, people race for incomes to keep buying things they do not need, or do something they do not have to do. For example, an office worker who stays at their workplace extra hours, does not take days off, works hard and responsibly to earn a salary—and spends his or her free money to buy a new iPad and a car, even though they have several such things already. A downscaler would exclude ubiquitous consumption, calculate the amount of work needed to sustain his or her needs, and enjoy a less stressful life free of the race for achievements. A person who consciously chooses public transport over a car, camps locally instead of travelling to the Bahamas, for instance, and chooses a less-paid job with a more flexible schedule in order to dedicate more time to family can be called a downscaler (IFR).\n\nMold melting is what the majority of people probably sees downshifting as. Imagine you are a salaryman whose work is to write reports, send emails, and do other boring tasks; deep inside, however, you have always dreamed of becoming an artist, owning a studio and living on the sales of your own art. In this case, you have three options: keep working at your current job because it is stable and familiar; keep working, but try to allocate some time for your hobbies; or, you can act as a mold melter: quit your job and do your best to become an artist. The most famous mold melter of all times was, perhaps, the ancient Roman emperor Diocletian, who once resigned his post and moved to a village to grow cabbages.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that mold melters are impulsive weirdos. A person who wants to downshift this way will most likely revise their consumption, but in a much more radical way than a downscaler. A future mold melter will create an extensive and detailed plan of how to sustain themselves on minimum wages or savings for a period of time before they can start living on what they want to do. Mold melting is a responsible approach to shifting from one paradigm to another (IFR).\n\nDownshifting is an alternative way of living for people who are too tired to maintain a contemporary, stressful life. Some people feel they want to slow down the pace of their lives, look around, dedicate more time to whom or what they love; others dream of radical changes, a total reset of lifestyle and career. In any case, downshifting is steadily becoming a trend, and if you feel like your current work and life is too much for you to take, you might want to consider some form of downshifting.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the evidence for intelligent extraterrestrial life?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The question of whether there is intelligent extraterrestrial life has interested humanity for decades. All over the world, one can find people claiming to have seen UFOs or have been abducted; this is not to mention the infamous Area 51, numerous conspiracy theories surrounding alien entities on Earth, the FBI’s “Blue Book,” and so on. However, all of these stories have remained merely science-fiction stories—at least, until October 2015, when the Kepler telescope discovered something that might be an megastructure built by aliens.\n\nThe Kepler telescope was designed to discover exoplanets, stellar flares, star spots, and dusty planetary rings. Exoplanets cannot be seen directly—instead, Kepler detects slight dips in the light of a star; an exoplanet orbiting around a sun makes its light dim, creating a lightcurve. This lightcurve allows us to figure out a planet’s approximate size and even shape. Obviously, planets possess a round shape, due to the basic physical laws that dictate that a planetary body is governed by hydrostatic equilibrium and which, to cut the long story short, causes its round shape (Discovery).\n\nBut what Kepler has discovered recently is far more exciting. The star which it observed recently—KIC 8462852—displays a dramatic and strange dimming of its starlight. Normally, stars with exoplanets revolving around them manifest a 1-2% drop in their light; however, KIC’s light dims by approximately 20%. What is more fascinating is that these drops are not periodical, as one would expect from an orbiting astronomical object, but seem to occur randomly; at least, during the 1600 days of Kepler’s observations of the star, these intervals were irregular: approximately after 800 days of observation, KIC’s light dropped by 15%, and on the day 1500, the dimming reached 20% of the starlight. Such a dramatic drop of brightness could occur if only the object passing in front of the star was at least half of its size. This object is unlikely to be a planet though: one of the largest-known planets, Jupiter, is only 1\/10th of the size of our sun, and KIC is 1.5 times larger than our sun (The Guardian).\n\nMost likely, based on what the strange light pattern “tells” scientists, there is a whole mess of objects circling KIC 8462852. These objects seem to be organized in a sort of formation, and are in general big enough to block a significant amount of KIC’s light. Researchers Yale Postdoc and Tabetha Boyajian wrote that, “KIC 8462852 was observed to undergo irregularly shaped, aperiodic dips in flux down to below the 20% level. The dipping activity can last for between 5 and 80 days […] We determine that KIC 8462852 is a main-sequence F3 V\/IV star, with a rotation period ~0.88 d, that exhibits no significant IR excess.“ They have also added that this mess of objects is neither a comet field nor asteroid remnants. Jason Wright, an astronomer from Penn State University, suggested that the objects could be an industrial object, a megastructure constructed by aliens. “Aliens should always be the very last hypothesis you consider, but this looked like something you would expect an alien civilization to build,” Wright admitted.\n\nAlthough it is too early to make unequivocal conclusions, the phenomenon of KIC challenges everything astronomers know about exoplanets and the stars around which they revolve. Too big for a planet, unlikely to be a field of asteroid remnants of comets, the mysterious object near the star can be the first evidence of the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the reasons people develop low self-esteem?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There is a saying that there is no bigger enemy to a man than a man himself. This saying is fair for all genders though; indeed, no one can affect your life as much as you can do yourself—both in a positive or a negative way. All of us have at least once met people who would have nice jobs, pleasant appearances, fulfilled lives—but who are chronically displeased with themselves, would tend to criticize or underestimate themselves, or to seek and find flaws in whatever they do. Such people create obstacles in their own way—so one might say they are enemies of themselves; and the most common reason for such destructive behavior is low self-esteem.\n\nWhat people think about themselves seems to be based on facts, and we have got used to thinking we can trust our visions of who we are—but in fact, these are nothing more than opinions, and these opinions can be wrong. Such opinions usually exist as statements, stationed in our subconscious and affecting the way people consciously think and act. When these opinions are positive (“I am good,” “I am worthwhile,” I am creative,” “I am loved and respected”) a person has more confidence in themselves, is less prone to stress and self-ostracism, and tends to deal with life complications better; however, if the set of subconscious opinions is negative, a person may experience various difficulties in their life—and the larger part of these difficulties they create for themselves (IFR).\n\nLow self-esteem does not strike a person out of the blue. Reasons exist in a person’s past that lead to the formation of negative beliefs. Usually, low self-esteem has higher chances to develop in a person if he or she was punished systematically in their childhood; alienated from peers at school, misunderstood, or did not meet certain standards; was openly abused or neglected; were an object of someone’s else frustration and distress; was deprived of warmth and interest; belonged to an ostracized social group, and so on (Overcoming). The potential reasons are numerous, and foreseeing them all in the process of parenting is impossible; however, parents should do everything possible to minimize the risks. Other possible risk factors are illness or injury, culture, or religion, the way other people react to a person, and even mass media messages (Mayo Clinic).\n\nSo, how does one know if their self-esteem is low? There are certain patterns people with the regarded problem think and act. The whole list of how they manage to hurt themselves would probably be too long for an academic paper, but generally a person with low self-esteem tends to withdraw from social activities; feels constant anxiety, severe changes of mood, and shyness; feels like they fail to socialize—a situation of direct communication may cause stuttering, blushing, and so on. People with low self-esteem cannot be helped by giving them cheering compliments—they do not believe them, and fail to accept them, since they tend to focus only on his or her negative sides. Also, cases of eating disorders, orientation on the opinions of surrounding people, depression, and reluctance to do anything connected to socialization are more frequent among people with low self-esteem (self-confidence.co.uk).\n\nIs there a way out? Yes, and it might be more obvious than what many people probably think. The trick is that people with low self-esteem are incredibly confident about themselves—in their worthlessness, to be exact. For some reason, they believe only their negative images of themselves are true, and tend to doubt any positive signals about their personalities. Therefore, one of the methods to deal with the problem might be to raise these people’s uncertainty: why should not they start doubting their negative affirmations as well? This might be the first step towards a turnaround: when a person treats his or her negative beliefs critically, it is easier for them to turn to a healthier self-image. Yet another way might be to quit trying to affect self-esteem directly, and find a bypass; since self-esteem is rather often affected by what we do, success in certain spheres of life might lead to a boost of self-esteem as a happy side-effect (self-confidence.co.uk).\n\nThe problems people with low self-esteem imagine exist mostly within their own heads, and have little to do with reality. Mostly developed as a result of traumatizing experiences in childhood, low self-esteem can prevent a person from engaging in collective environments, and enjoying social communications. However, if a person starts to evaluate their negative self-beliefs more critically, and focuses on real life activities, their self-esteem might turn to a brighter side.###"}
{"prompt":"How does spectroscopy allow astronomers to study stars located millions of light years away from Earth?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" During the 20th and the 21st centuries, humanity greatly advanced in scientific development. The human mind has found ways to draw energy from the wind, sun, and earth; in about 30 years, Mars and the Moon will probably become inhabited; laser surgery, cybernetic prosthetics, and all kinds of mobile Internet technologies are becoming commonplace at the moment. One of such commonplaces—wonderful in their nature, but already routine and widely used—is the spectroscopy of stars, allowing astronomers to study stars located millions of light years away from Earth.\n\nSpectroscopy is the analysis of light emitted by an astronomical object—be it a star, a galaxy, a nebula, and so on. Most of the information astronomers nowadays receive is acquired through spectroscopy. This method of analysis and observation had been invented long ago; the first steps to create it were taken in 1850 by Joseph Fraunhofer, who constructed the first crude spectroscope; since that time, this tool has been modernized and enhanced numerous times. Nowadays, in order to disperse light, scientists use diffraction gratings; this dispersed light is then projected onto a special device, a bit similar to a DSLR camera’s matrix. In the outcome, scientists get a 2-dimensional spectra in a digital format, and can extract all kinds of data from it (Cosmos).\n\nSpectroscopy is done at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays; the focus is on optical or visible light having wavelengths between 360 and 760 nanometers (nm)—from deep blue to far red (University of Washington). However, it is the studying of cosmos that seems to be giving the most revolutionary results, in regard to physics and science in general.\n\nProfessor Fred Watson from the Australian Astronomical Observatory explains it in a simple way: “You take the light from a star, planet or galaxy and pass it through a spectroscope, which is a bit like a prism letting you split the light into its component colours […] It lets you see the chemicals being absorbed or emitted by the light source. From this you can work out all sorts of things” (ABC Science).\n\nFor instance, spectroscopy allows us to figure out the chemical composition of stars. It is possible due to emission lines and absorption lines. Emission lines are the radiation emitted by certain chemicals at very specific wavelengths when heated or electrically charged; absorption lines appear when the light from a hot source comes through a cooler gas, which cancels some of the emission lines (ABC Science). Every chemical creates its own emission and absorption lines, so they are a cosmic cipher for encrypting the periodical table, so to say.\n\nSpectroscopy allows scientists to determine the direction and trajectory of an astronomical object’s movement, as well as its velocity; all this is possible due to the Doppler effect. Originally discovered while studying sound, the effect implies that when the source of sound gets closer to the observer, the frequency of sound becomes higher (because sound waves “compress” and become shorter), and when this source gets farther, the sound gets lower, because sound waves “stretch” in space. Surprisingly, the same works for light waves. The change in frequency of wavelengths allows astronomers to determine whether an object is moving towards or away from them. “In light waves, it causes things moving towards you to shift to shorter wavelengths at the blue end of the spectrum. And objects moving away from you shift to longer frequencies, at the red end of the spectrum” (ABC Science). Age, mass, and other parameters that astronomical objects possess can be also calculated solely due to spectroscopy.\n\nIf you have ever wondered how scientists manage to make all kinds of amazing discoveries about distant galaxies, or how they know what stars consist of, spectroscopy is the answer to your question. Discovered in the middle of the 19th century, it has become one of the major tools of studying the Universe. It allows astronomers to learn a lot about any observed object, starting from its mass and distance from Earth, and ending up with chemical composition, age, and temperature. In the future, humanity will probably invent even more sophisticated means of researching stars, but so far, spectroscopy is one of the most amazing and precise tools astrophysicists have.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of food poisoning?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Physical health is a valuable but easily spent resource. Not speaking of serious chronic diseases, there are a lot of minor, less noticeable threats that can nevertheless affect one’s physical condition and productivity: the common cold, headaches, and nausea are among them. However, among these minor threats, the most distressing one is perhaps food poisoning, which can easily incapacitate a person for at least several days.\n\nA person usually gets food poisoning as a result of consuming contaminated or spoiled food and drinks. It often happens at picnics, in school cafeterias, restaurants, and other similar places. There are different ways food can get contaminated. For example, meat can become contaminated by contacting the intestines of an animal being processed; water can contact animal or human waste and become infected as well. Generally, contamination occurs when food is improperly processed or stored. Other ways of contamination include dirty hands, improperly-cleaned cooking utensils, an expired expiry date, and so on. Besides, a person can get food poisoning when consuming raw or under-cooked products—fruit, vegetables, fish, eggs, or meat (Medline Plus).\n\nGenerally speaking, food poisoning is an intoxication caused by low-quality food. However, a more meticulous scrutiny reveals that food poisoning has a lot to do with malicious bacterium; commonly, these bacterium comprise Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Listeria, and some others. Although they are, in general, not life-threatening, in rare cases there can be serious complications caused by the exposure to these bacterium, such as reactive arthritis or brain\/nerve problems (Web MD).\n\nSymptoms of food poisoning include fever, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, general weakness, and strong abdominal pain or cramps. Usually, the symptoms start within the first several hours after contamination, but in some cases, food poisoning symptoms can remain hidden for days or even weeks. The sickness usually lasts up to three days; in the majority of cases, one can treat the sickness themselves: usually it is enough to adhere to a special diet (often it is is recommended to eat boiled rice, and drink a lot of strong tea or plain water) and take charcoal pills. However, there might be cases when it is crucial that a person with food poisoning visits a doctor. The list of disturbing symptoms includes bloody vomit or stools; diarrhea for more than three days; an oral temperature higher than 101.5 F; dehydration, severe weakness, and neurological symptoms such as blurry vision or tingling (Mayo Clinic).\n\nFood poisoning is a common but distressing digestion disorder usually caused by the consumption of contaminated food. In order to minimize the risks of developing the symptoms, which include nausea, diarrhea, weakness, fever, and some other manifestations, one should avoid eating raw or under-cooked food, wash hands before meals, and always check the expiry date on a product package. Food poisoning is easy to treat, but there are cases when it is better to seek medical aid; these cases include having blood in one’s vomit or stool, dehydration, high oral temperature, and neurological symptoms.###"}
{"prompt":"How does multitasking negatively affect workers?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Nowadays, if you want to get employed in a prospective company, you need to be outstanding in order to withstand competition. Employers often promote inflated standards to their would-be workers, even if their duties include only xerox copying or sharpening pencils. One of the qualities crucial for any employee is multitasking; throughout the recent decade, it has become almost a cult. However, although it is believed that a multitasking person can complete more work within the same amount of time compared to a “regular” worker, in fact multitasking is not only ineffective, but also harmful for those who try to spread their energy on working on several projects at once.\n\nMultitasking is not what everyone thinks it is—simultaneous work in several different directions. In fact, multitasking should be called “task switching.” According to Guy Winch, PhD and the author of the book “Emotional First Aid: Practical Strategies for Treating Failure, Rejection, Guilt and Other Everyday Psychological Injuries,” our brains are not capable of maintaining constant attention towards several objects at once. “It’s like a pie chart, and whatever we’re working on is going to take up the majority of that pie. There’s not a lot left over for other things, with the exception of automatic behaviors like walking or chewing gum,” Guy Winch says (Health.com). So, a person has to constantly switch from one activity to another, without getting themselves fully engaged in at least one of them.\n\nIf you think this is productive, you are wrong. The negative effect of multitasking on productivity has been proven by numerous researchers; one of the most recent experiments proving this statement has been conducted by the researcher Zhen Wang. The participants of her experiment who were told to do several things simultaneously displayed an increased feeling of being pleased with themselves, and in these terms multitasking might be beneficial; however, when it came to evaluating the results of the tasks these people were to accomplish, it turned out they are much worse compared to people who were free to prioritize their activities and do things one at a time (Lifehack.org).\n\nMultitasking being bad for work is just half of the problem; the second half of it lies in the fact that spreading your energy on several tasks at once is detrimental not just for your productivity, but for yourself as well. Over-stimulation caused by your brain being constantly bombarded by incoming external stimulation (such as phone calls, requests, new tasks, and so on) puts you at risk of becoming unable to distinguish what is important and what is not. In 2009, a group of researchers from Stanford University led by Clifford Nass, PhD, figured out that multitasking participants were distracted the most by unimportant information stored in their short-term memory; multitasking people also tend to forget their tasks’ details, thus becoming less able to perform them well. Besides, multitasking leads to the increase of stress levels, burnout, employee absences, disability, and so on (Chron). Therefore, sometimes it can be useful for office workers to turn off notifications on their smartphones, and pay all their attention to one task at a time.\n\nEfficient multitasking is a myth brought to life by employers’ desire to have fewer workers who would do more work in the same amounts of time. Multitasking is nothing else but switching between tasks, as the human brain is not capable of maintaining attention on different tasks for a long time. Research shows that multitasking does not lead to an increase of productivity; on the contrary, multitasking workers show worse results compared to their non-multitasking colleagues; they also tend to have problems with memory and display increased stress levels, which inhibits workers’ morale and leads to their absences and other negative effects. Therefore, employers and employees should stop deceiving themselves, and return to the good old way of working: one task at a time.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the most recent discovery about water on Mars?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" For hundreds of years—perhaps since the times when people realized that Earth is not the center of Universe—humanity has wondered whether there was life on other planets. For some reason, Mars—the planet that is especially easy to notice in the night sky—was always considered to be the most prospective planet in these terms. Scientists, astronomers, science fiction writers, and common people have been excited by the possibility of the existence of life on Mars; these hopes are vastly reflected in modern mass-culture. And what is the most exciting is that these hopes may have a rationale behind them; the most recent astronomical observations show there is flowing water on Mars—and where is water, there is life.\n\nObserving the surface of the Red Planet allows scientists to assume that sometime in the planet’s early history—billions of years ago—it was covered with oceans, and had rivers flowing on its surface. It is considered that Mars was warm and moist enough to host life—not as we would like to imagine life on other planets, since most likely it was some sort of microbial life. However, the problem of the Red Planet is that its mass is lighter compared to Earth, which means its gravity was not strong enough to sustain the atmosphere. Gradually, the water evaporated into the atmosphere, and the atmosphere escaped into space, leaving Mars as the desolate desert we know today (Space.com).\n\nThere have been three more rover missions to Mars, including the latest: Curiosity-1. One of their missions was to find evidence that the Red Planet had once been warmer and capable of supporting life. In 2014, the data collected by Curiosity assured scientists there had once been liquid water on Mars. In particular, the analysis of rocks at the bottom of Mount Sharp in the middle of Gale Crater—a 96-mile-wide barren bowl—has demonstrated rather intriguing results: judging from the alternating sediment layers at the base of the mountain, scientists assumed that over the course of millions of years, water flowed on Mars at different levels. Back then, Curiosity scientists suggested that Gale Crater was covered by a large ocean (The Atlantic).\n\nThe most revolutionary discovery, however, has been made just recently, on September 28, 2015. NASA has found absolute evidence that there is liquid water on Mars at present. NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter identified the presence of perchlorates—hydrated minerals that have formed streaks on slopes on Mars’ surface. Perchlorates—at least some of them—are known to be able to keep water from freezing in extremely low temperatures; for example, -94 Fahrenheit, which is a temperature close to the average one on Mars, is not an obstacle for certain perchlorates to keep water from freezing. During the Mars “hot” seasons, when the temperature on the surface gets around -10 degrees Fahrenheit, perchlorates form streaks—also called recurring slope lineae—on the Martian surface. During the cold season, these lines usually disappear (Wired.com).\n\nAccording to Lujendra Ojha, one of the project’s researchers, this gives scientists a clearer picture of what water is like on Mars. “Something is hydrating these salts, and it appears to be these streaks that come and go with the seasons. This means the water on Mars is briny, rather than pure. It makes sense, because salts lower the freezing point of water. Even if RSL are slightly underground, where it’s even colder than the surface temperature, the salts would keep the water in a liquid form and allow it to creep down Martian slopes.” Although their team has no clue about where the water comes from, they suggest it might be the underground ice melting, or subterranean streams feeding water to the surface (Wired.com).\n\nAlthough the recent NASA discovery is not the long anticipated image of water freely flowing on the Martian surface, it has aided scientists in figuring out the truth about water on the Red Planet. Great scientific discoveries rarely look like something fabulous—remember the Newton’s apple, for example—but the form in which these discoveries are made rarely influence the greatness of their outcomes.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the differences between Generation Z and their predecessors?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is not a secret that every generation of people has its own values, behavioral patterns, and ways of thinking. Problems related to this fact—such as misunderstandings between people of different ages, “father-son” problems, and so on—have existed, perhaps, since the times of primeval people. These problems tend to go beyond family relationships, also spreading to such spheres as social hierarchy and work. Nowadays, American society mostly consists of the representatives of Generation X (people born in 1960s) and Y (born in 1980s-early 1990s); their behaviors and traits are already well-studied. However, recently yet another generation has climbed up on the stage: Generation Z, people born in late 1990s-early 2000s, and although sociologists and psychologists have not studied them completely yet, it is already known that Generation Z is completely different from their predecessors.\n\nBut what are these differences? This is the first generation that cannot imagine a life without having a mobile gadget with an access to the Internet. Z people never lived in times without Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social media services. Whatever they need, they can easily find on the Internet right at their fingertips (thanks to smartphones), and mostly for free.\n\nThis has its good and bad sides. From one point of view, Generation Z is native to the Internet: they are more savvy with it, and they navigate it with an ease that their Y predecessors, the millennials, could only dream of; in the age of digital technologies, it is a valuable trait. On the other hand, Generation Z no more have a need to use their long-term memory and to be perceptive: all knowledge they need is saved on the cloud or on distant servers. This has lead to a drastic result: the average attention span of a Generation Z teen is only 8.25 seconds! This means they are unable to focus on something for more than eight seconds. Even a goldfish has a larger attention span of nine seconds (The Telegraph).\n\nConsidering the enormous daily flow of information, Generation Z cannot afford paying attention to everything around them; they have to be picky, to fish out valuable information from the flow. Their attention span is shorter, but they can sort the information out easier and faster, so one cannot say Generation Z is less effective when working, or less capable than millennials. Besides, when they find something truly worth their attention, they demonstrate commitment and the ability to instantly focus on what they find interesting (Co.Exist).\n\nThe ability to quickly navigate through a large amounts of information allows the representatives of Generation Z to develop more diverse personalities. Generation Z representatives often have unusual hobbies and interests (sometimes not typical for teenagers and young people—astrophysics, for example), and obtain knowledge from a wider range of disciplines compared to their predecessors, although this knowledge may be superficial (IFR).\n\nAt the same time, there is a number of difficulties and drawbacks typical for this generation. One of them is having unrealistic expectations for themselves and for other people. This is often fueled by a rampant celebrity culture. Chloe Combi, a consultant on youth issues for the Mayor of London, and the author of research dedicated to Generation Z, explains it by the fact that, “Gen Z has grown up with reality TV stars, social media celebrities and world-famous twenty-something billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg.” What is more important and dangerous is that the accessibility of any Internet content—including porn—has negatively affected the way Generation Z representatives treat personal and sexual relationships. Generation Z is obsessed with sex, and sexual insults. Harassment is also becoming more common among its representatives (The Telegraph). Women are more objectified within this generation, and abnormal sexual behavior—like in porn movies—is often imitated and considered normal.\n\nGeneration Z is a new generation that sociologists are actively studying at the moment. Consisting of digital natives, Generation Z heavily relies on the Internet and other technologies in their daily lives. This makes its representatives more diverse personalities with knowledge in a wide range of disciplines, with unusual hobbies and interests, and with a superior ability to instantly sort out information and find something worth attention. At the same time, Generation Z representatives have alarmingly-short attention spans on average (less than a goldfish), and demonstrate unrealistic expectations towards themselves and surrounding people. They are also more sexually active, and because of an easy accessibility of pornography, they tend to misinterpret sexual relationships, and imitate abusing sexual behavior demonstrated in porn movies. Therefore, American society needs to find ways to make use of Generation Z’s positive traits, and at the same time somehow neutralize the negative ones.###"}
{"prompt":"How did Nikola Tesla's inventions change the world?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is difficult to underestimate the role of a single person in the development of culture, science, technology, and so on. Throughout history, the greatest inventions and greatest discoveries usually belonged not to groups of people, but to single individuals; these persons moved humanity forward. One such person was a famous Serbian inventor, Nikola Tesla. Widely known among scientists, he nevertheless remains almost unknown to the wider public, although the scale of his genius was probably compatible with Einstein’s.\n\nMany of this man’s inventions have forever changed the world we live in. For example, the rotating magnetic field, which was his first breakthrough in 1882; a rotating magnetic field allows power engines to have an alternating current without having to convert it into a direct current (as it had to be done before the invention of a rotating magnetic field). Just a year after Tesla had brought  the idea of an alternating current motor to life, he built a physical model of it; within two years, the AC motor was used in AC generators and transformers. In 1897, Nikola Tesla had introduced the idea of the radio to the world—he had sent a wireless transmission from his laboratory in New York to a boat located 25 miles away. Antennas, tuners, and everything else related to the radio was also invented by him, although the credit for these inventions was given to an inventor named Guglielmo Marconi (HowStuffWorks). This is not the full list, of course.\n\nApart from his inventions, Nikola Tesla was an intriguing and interesting personality himself. Although being renowned and rich, and thus being popular among women, he nevertheless remained single, abstaining from having any emotional and sexual connection with women; he believed that it would negatively affect his thinking capabilities. Still, in one of his interviews, he admitted that he doubted this decision from time to time (EDN.com). He rarely slept, claiming that for him it was enough to take a quick two-hours long nap to completely refresh his mind and body; in addition, he was a vegetarian, and had photographic memory—Tesla could remember contents of an entire book after briefly looking at its pages (LiveScience.com).\n\nHe had his own mental peculiarities; perhaps all people do, but those of his were as unique as himself. He was afraid of dirt and diseases, and could not stand being exposed to certain things, such as earrings, pearls, hair, or overweight women. He was also known to have several OCDs, such as constant hand-washing and counting items in his mind. His passion for cleanliness was obsessive, as well as his proneness to self-discipline; however, he never asked for psychiatric aid, and even managed to use some of his OCDs in favor of his studies (scienceblogs.com).\n\nNikola Tesla was a scientist and inventor who forever changed the world we live in. Without him, we would probably never use a radio (or not until decades later); AC motors, transformers, antennas, and a lot of other things related to electricity would hardly be possible without this man. Possessing attributes such as a photographic memory, a strong intelligence, self-discipline, and devotion to his work, he also suffered from a number of quirks: OCDs and strange aversions. Still, this only made his personality more intriguing and fascinating.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the most common symptoms of seasonal affective disorder?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Each season of the year is beautiful in its own way; throughout centuries, people have learned to benefit from each of them, mostly in terms of agriculture and hunting. There are, however, dangers some seasons possess; in winter, it is frost; in summer, exhausting heat; in spring, floods and flower pollen (bad for allergic people). But what about autumn? For many people, fall is not just a time of golden leaves and heavy rains, but also a period when people become melancholic, depressed, tired, and sleepy. Why? The answer is: because they develop symptoms of seasonal affected disorder (or SAD), or seasonal depression, as it is commonly called.\n\nSAD mostly affects a person’s mood; the same time each year, an individual with SAD will experience mood changes and other symptoms, usually starting from September or October, when the weather becomes colder and days are shorter (Mayo Clinic). This period ends in April or May, but in rare cases, people may experience SAD even in the summer (Cleveland Clinic).\n\nAccording to scientists, among the possible reasons why an individual may have a SAD, there may be certain brain hormones triggering attitude-related changes during specific periods of a year. Less sunlight can cause our brains to produce less serotonin—a hormone that directly affects our positive mood; the more serotonin your brain produces, the better you feel. The lack of this hormone can result in feeling depressed and exhausted. Respectively, SAD is less often observed in those regions of the world where people do not have a lack of sunlight, even in winter (WebMD).\n\nThe most common symptoms of autumn or winter SAD are the following: anxiety, irritability, self-isolation, loss of interest in hobbies, sadness, absentmindednes, psychological and physical fatigue, sleepiness, and weight gain. The more rare summer SAD includes symptoms that are the opposite: restlessness, problems with sleeping, and decreased appetite (Cleveland Clinic).\n\nSeasonal depression is not the same as major depression (however, it does not mean that major depression cannot have the symptoms of SAD). Generally, SAD is a temporary psychological condition connected to the lack of serotonin caused by the change of seasons. Among the most common SAD symptoms one should mention anxiety, irritability, absentmindedness, abandoning one’s usual social activities and hobbies, fatigue, and so on. In the case of the more rare summer SAD, the symptoms may be the opposite, including problems with sleep, weight loss, and restlessness. SAD is less rare than we usually imagine, and we should be on guard to not be susceptible to its adverse effects.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the peculiar habits of famous writers?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Creative people are often referred to as being strange. Indeed, the way such people approach trivial tasks, their outlooks, manners, and values can be slightly or even significantly different from the rest of their given society. At the same time, such individuals are capable of creating something that is out of many people’s competence: visual arts, music, literature, and so on. In particular, many famous writers were known to be eccentric; they developed peculiar habits and rituals—often for the sake of creative productivity or inspiration—that their contemporaries often could not accept as normal.\n\nFor example, Jack Kerouac was known not just to lead a somewhat unhealthy and marginal lifestyle, but also for his fancy manner of writing; there were no computers in his days, and everything was typed on a typewriter. It implied, in particular, the manual “reloading” of a typewriter: when an author finished a page, he or she had to pull it out and insert a new one. Kerouac hated this limitation; in order to avoid it, he wrote on long scroll-like sheets that would extend seemingly infinitely. When he was working on his famous novel “On The Road,” he typed all of it this way; Kerouac’s prose often flows like water, his pace of writing was rapid, so in order to maintain it, using this type of paper was fine. He had, however, complications with his editor Robert Giroux because of this technique (Brainpickings.org).\n\nSome famous writers preferred to write while lying down. Writing this way (like Woody Allen, George Orwell, Mark Twain, or Truman Capote) can be considered peculiar to some extent, but compared to Victor Hugo’s habit, it is mundane. How about writing while being naked? When Victor Hugo was working on his famous “The Hunchback of Notre Dame” he felt he was unable to waste his time and go outside, so he asked his relatives to take away all his clothes. This way he could stay in his cabinet and write. Even when the days were cold, he would work on the novel while being wrapped just in a blanket (Lifehack.org).\n\nWilliam Faulkner, one of the most famous American writers, was known to have severe problems with alcohol; he consumed large portions of it while writing. This habit of his started after meeting Sherwood Anderson in New Orleans. Faulkner himself explained his habit (or addiction) in the following way: “We’d meet in the evenings, and we’d go to a drinking place and we’d sit around ’till one or two o’clock drinking, and still me listening and him talking. Then in the morning he would be in seclusion working, and the next time I’d see him, the same thing, we would spend the afternoon and evening together, the next morning he’d be working. And I thought then, if that was the life it took to be a writer, that was the life for me” (Flavorwire.com).\n\nAs it can be seen, famous writers often had habits that did not quite fit into societal norms. Jack Kerouac neglected the requirements of his editors in favor of his comfort: to manage his own fast pace of writing, he would tape paper sheets together in the form of a scroll, so that he did not have to reload his typewriter all the time. Victor Hugo would ask his relatives to take away all of his clothes—this way he had no opportunity to go outside, and thus had to stay at home working on his novels. William Faulkner drank a lot of whiskey when he was writing, so it is hard to distinguish whether it was an addiction or a routine. Such behaviors are different from the way people usually behave, so it can be said that these are ways of creative people.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the consequences of a star explosion?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Humanity has been amazed by stars for centuries. In the age of ancient myths and legends, in the times when sailors used constellations to navigate in oceans, and until now, stars have remained one of the biggest mysteries people have ever encountered. Nowadays, scientists can figure out not only the distance between a certain star and Earth, but also the star’s composition, mass, age, and many other parameters. Technological progress allows us to understand the universe much deeper than it was possible for scientists in the past. One of the phenomenon that modern science managed to explain is the explosion of stars, or supernovae.\n\nIn 1604, Johannes Kepler discovered the last observed supernova in the Milky Way. Being a brilliant scientist, it is still unlikely he could comprehend or explain the phenomena he observed and described. A more recent supernovae explosion that occurred in our galaxy took place about one hundred years ago; it was discovered by the NASA Chandra telescope (NASA). Years of observations prove that supernovae occur not just in the Milky Way, but around the whole observable Universe. Such explosions are not unique or rare—on average, they occur once in 50 years; however, each of these explosions provide scientists with valuable data, enabling them to understand the Universe better (Space.com).\n\nBut not every star star becomes a supernovae. For many of them, it is typical to cool down and turn into white dwarfs. However, in some cases, stars “refuse” to simply fade away. Some of them accumulate matter from neighboring stars until a runaway nuclear reaction ignites (type one supernova); others run out of their fuel—the thermonuclear reaction inside such stars slows down, and the star collapses under its own gravity (type two supernova). In the second case, as a result of an explosion, a neutron star may later form; however, scientists believe that in case of the collapsing star being massive enough (around 30 masses of our sun), it may turn into a black hole instead (Space.com).\n\nWhen a star explodes, it emits matter into surrounding space at the speed of about 25,000 miles per second. Among these emissions is iron—one of the key elements of which our planet and we ourselves consist of. Moreover, supernovas (and them only) are a source of all known heavy elements in the Universe; this fact makes it possible to say that all of us consist of ancient star matter (National Geographic). Moreover, these very elements travel across the Universe to form new stars, planets, and other objects. Due to supernovae, scientists have discovered that our Universe is constantly expanding, and supposedly it is not the last surprise that studying these huge cosmic explosions can bring to us.\n\nA supernova is a star explosion. When a star becomes old, it either collapses under its own mass, or accumulates matter from nearby stars, and in both variants, an explosion occurs. During the explosion, they jettison a vast amount of matter into the surrounding space; this is the matter of which all objects—including human beings—in the Universe consist of.###"}
{"prompt":"What is nanotechnology and how can it revolutionize reality?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Among all the technological wonders of modernity, there is one that, in perspective, can revolutionize reality. During the recent two centuries, there have been several such discoveries: electricity, radio waves, flight, nuclear energy, the Internet, and others. But today humanity stands on the edge of something completely new: nanotechnology.\n\nTo start the explanation of nanotechnology properly, let us figure out what is this “nano” part of the word. “Nano” is a prefix used in the metric system, meaning one billionth part of something; so, nanometer, a standard measurement unit, is a 0,000000001 part of a meter. To be able to imagine how small this value is, let us refer to examples. One inch is 25,400,000 nanometers. Even a more illustrative example: a sheet of regular office A4 paper is 100,000 nanometers thick (Nano.gov). Human hair is about 80,000 nanometers thick (Nanowerk.com). Generally speaking, “nano” in “nanotechnology” means “very small, tiny.”\n\nSo, in this case, what exactly is nanotechnology? According to the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative, nanotechnology implies the ability to understand and control matter at dimensions between approximately from 100 up to one nanometer; it also involves imaging, measuring, modeling, and manipulating matter at the estimated length scale (Nanowerk.com). At the nanoscale, matter possesses unique properties; properties of materials behave under atomic and molecular rules, and this is why nanotechnology is so advanced: researchers can gain control over these unique properties to create new tools and products in areas of science and engineering (nnin.org). For example, nanotechnology allows to construct materials and structures at an atomic scale; this means scientists can “build” materials from atoms and molecules.\n\nNanotechnology is still in the process of development, but nevertheless, it can already surprise humanity with wonders that were impossible several decades ago. For example, there are special carbon nanotubes that are able to turn into an artificial muscle; there is a 3D printer that can print new cancer drugs; there already exist self-healing materials, such as concrete that fills in its cracks to ship hulls that knit back together; viruses were created that convert pressure into electrical energy, and so on. These and other inventions are the beginning of a new technological era (io9.com).\n\nNanotechnology is a relatively new branch of science that can revolutionize the reality we live in today. Nanotechnology operates with matter at dimensions between one to one hundred nanometers. This allows scientists to gain control over the unique properties that matter at such a small scale possesses. Self-healing materials, artificial muscle, and other wonderful inventions are only the beginning of the new era of technology.###"}
{"prompt":"What are black holes and how do they form?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The amount of amazing scientific discoveries being made nowadays is incredibly high. Almost every day, humanity discovers something that either confirms or denies the existing understanding of the Universe. However, there still are a number of mysteries that astronomers are on the cusp of solving. Among such mysteries are black holes—being perhaps the most popular and well-known (due to mass culture) space phenomenon—which are one of the least researched.\n\nGenerally speaking, a black hole is a space object possessing extreme density; its mass is so enormous, and the respective gravitational attraction is so powerful, that even light cannot escape its trap. This is why they are called ‘black holes’—you cannot see them without special devices, since there is no light in the point where a black hole is. The first person to have predicted this phenomena was Albert Einstein, and the term ‘black hole’ appeared in 1967, introduced by the American astronomer John Wheeler. But, only in 1971 was the first black hole discovered (Space.com).\n\nBut how do black holes appear? Science offers us the following explanation: when a large star burns the last of its ‘fuel,’ it may start collapsing under its own mass, falling in on itself until it shrinks to an object much smaller than the original star, but with the same mass—the stellar black hole (Space.com).\n\nNo one knows exactly what is going on inside black holes. A popular science-fiction topic (raised in the recent film ‘Interstellar,’ for example) refers to what happens if somebody falls into a black hole. Some believe black holes to be the predicted wormholes to other parts of the Universe. Others make less fantastic suggestions. Either way, what is truly amazing about black holes is how they distort time and space. If a person ‘falls’ into a black hole, for an outsider, the movement of this person will be slowing down, unless it finally freezes (universetoday.com). Moreover, according to Stephen Hawking, the incredible gravity of a black hole will be endlessly stretching this person in length. However, for the person ‘falling’ into a black hole, time will seem to pass as usual—and, respectively, this person will not notice any spacial distortions either.\n\nAnother popular question is, “What happens if a black hole gets too close to Earth?” Black holes do not move around space. Nothing bad will happen to Earth, because no black hole is close enough to the solar system to consume our planet. However, if theoretically a black hole, possessing the same mass as the sun, took its place, nothing would happen anyways. The same mass means the same gravity, so the planets of the Solar System would keep orbiting the black hole as if nothing had happened (nasa.gov).\n\nBlack holes are quite the space phenomenon, with its properties being mysterious. Although predicted and described a century ago, they still possess one of the biggest conundrums for scientists. Originating from collapsed stars, black holes possess such an enormous gravity that they are able to distort time and space. However, as scientists claim, Earth is not in danger—yet.###"}
{"prompt":"How does playing outdoors affect children's health and well-being?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" About twenty years ago, when the Internet was not so easily accessible, and daily life was not spammed with all kinds of gadgets and electronic toys, children used to spend much more time outdoors. Nowadays, however, children prefer to spend free time at home, as this way they can watch more TV, play XBox or Playstation, play games on their parents’ tablets, and so on. Although this may also be more comfortable for parents, as they can watch and control their child easier when at home, for a child’s sake, it is better to encourage him or her to play outdoors.\n\nAccording to a new study held in Australia, teenagers who are regularly engaged in moderate-to-vigorous outdoor activity tend to have better health and easier social interactions than their peers who prefer to stay at home and play games. On average, the difference in time spent outdoors for these two groups was about 2.5 hours. Bamini Gopinath, a senior research fellow at the university’s Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research, says that “Parents should be conscious of the fact that outdoor physical activity is beneficial to their child’s overall health and well-being, and should try to limit the time their child spends in front of the screen” (HealthDay).\n\nIndeed, as it has been discovered that outdoor activity does not just generally improve the way a child feels; there are a number of specific benefits a child or teenager receives from playing outdoors. In particular, such children build stronger bones and muscles, are more flexible, and have a better sense of balance; such children also have a more healthy weight and cardiovascular system. Spending a lot of time outdoors helps teenagers avoid or reduce stress and feel more relaxed, have more confidence in themselves, boosts self-esteem, and allows them to keep in touch with old friends and also make new ones (Healthy Kids).\n\nAlso, spending time outdoors helps children to develop skills connected to creativity and invention. According to Robin Moore, an expert in the design of playing and learning environments, the objects of the outdoors grant children with limitless possibilities for playing, and each time a child steps outside, these games change, or new ones are invented. “Natural spaces and materials stimulate children’s limitless imagination and serve as the medium of inventiveness and creativity,” says Moore (Portland Family). Creative skills that a child develops when playing outside can help him or her in the future—for example, when there is a need to solve a non-standard task, or come up with a new idea.\n\nAlthough the popularity of gadgets and gaming consoles is beneficial for parents (since it is easier for them to control and watch their children when they are at home), for children’s sake, it is better that they spend more time outdoors. Playing outside not only improves a child’s general physical and psycho-emotional condition, but makes him or her physically stronger, more flexible, and self-confident. Playing outdoors positively affects self-esteem, helps a child to maintain a healthy weight, and develop social contacts. Moreover, playing outdoors contributes to the development of creative thinking and imagination. Therefore, parents should encourage their children to spend much more time outdoors.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the point of string theory?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The world we live in today is constantly advancing in terms of science and technology. Due to the Internet, the information about recent scientific discoveries—which has before been only known by the chosen few—is now widely available to the masses. Science has become popular, easily accessible, and even entertaining. One of the ever-popular objects of interest for both science enthusiasts and serious physicists is string theory, which has all the chances to become the most important theory in the history of science. But what is the point of it?\n\nTo start with, string theory has not been developed all at once in its modern version. On the contrary, its premises had been developed in the beginning of the 20th century, and since that time, string theory has undergone numerous changes. Accordingly, different types of string theory were named differently. In different times—and depending on the particularities of each type—the theory was called bosonic string theory, supersymmetric string theory, Type I, Type IIA, Type IIB, Heterotic string theories, M-theory, Matrix theory, Brane world scenarios, and many others (Dummies.com). Therefore, today’s name “string theory” is more a generalization for a number of co-related theories.\n\nString theory as we know it is an attempt of modern physics to find a single theory that offers the ultimate explanation to such forces of nature as gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. As physicists have known for a long time, matter consists of atoms; each of them is a combination of electrons, protons, and neutrons. As science progressed, it was discovered that electrons, protons, and neutrons consist of smaller particles. According to string theory, these particles are tiny vibrating strings (Physics.org). Scientists believe they are complex objects, the existence of which is possible due to long-chain inter-atomic bonding. A matter-based vibrating string is the result of a combination of conservation laws, mass, and convenient linearities that are inherent to our habitual form of spacetime. The strings are believed to be composed of a statistically unlikely form of long-chain bonding, depending on the properties of atoms, which are complex multiparticle structures and whose properties are rather unlikely (Physics.StackEschange).\n\nString theory introduces the idea of the multi-dimensional universe. So far, scientists have considered that only four dimensions exist (usual space dimensions and time). However, string theory suggests there should be around eleven dimensions. Nowadays, physicists are looking for a way to discover these seven new dimensions (Physics.org). Only time can show what practical use humanity will be able to extract from the discovery of these additional dimensions. However, it can be said that string theory does not deny the possibility of the existence of parallel universes.\n\nString theory today is the most prospective theory explaining such forces of nature as gravity, electromagnetism, and nuclear forces. It reconciles—or at least tries to—the general theory of relativity with quantum mechanics. Throughout its development, it has bore numerous names, such as the bosonic string theory, supersymmetric string theory, and so on. The theory implies that the particles of which atoms—and, respectively, matter—consist are strings vibrating at different frequencies. And, which seems to be more exciting to the public, string theory claims the existence of parallel universes is possible.###"}

Its clash of forces and ideas emits a power that does not fade.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the importance of African-American folk music in the musical history of the United States?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Note: This is a public domain essay written by Dorothy A. Johnson in 1922, with edits.\n\nMusic as the high art of which we think is a comparatively recent phenomena, but it is probable that music in some form has existed as long as speech itself. When humankind first expressed its ideas in words, it learned to express its emotions in music. One of the earliest comprehensible forms of music of the common people of any country was the folk song. As the recorded expression of the emotions of a people, they are invaluable, and they are of even greater importance, because in them, we see a beginning of the recognition of musical form as we have it today.(1) If folk music is of such vital importance in the musical history of a country, surely it is necessary to find some form of folk music as a musical background for our own country. America as a civilized nation is so new that her folk music is sadly lacking in comparison with other countries, but America has folk music in the songs of the African-American. Even the music of the Native Americans has not played so important a part in the musical history of our country.\n\nAfrican-Americans are probably the most gifted musically of any people; that is today, their music is the nearest like the music of the cultured nations in form and tonality. The songs as we have them today, many of them have been founded on the pentatonic scale, in which the fourth and seventh tones are omitted, and they nearly all retain an exotic character, owing to their origin. (2) The melodies are surprisingly sweet and artistic.\n\nAfrican-American folk songs are not so much expressions of joy and mirth as they are expressions of a slave’s sorrow in bondage from which they have no hope of release. Therefore, their songs are largely of a semi-religious character, expressing their hope of release in the world to come. One outstanding feature of these “sorrow songs” is the fact that a note of triumph is always present, even in the most despairing passages.(3) The well-known “spirituals” were songs or hymns the African-Americans made for themselves when they adopted their master’s religion, and are centered about such familiar religious subjects as Samson, the Ark, Daniel, Moses, Judgment Day, and Jesus Christ and his miracles.(4) Satan also was a favorite topic, being treated in much the same humorous fashion as he was treated in the old miracle plays of medieval Europe.(5) There are many beautiful melodies among the old spirituals, including such well known airs as “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” and “Steal Away to Jesus.” The latter is interesting, as it originally had an underlying significance far from religious. It was sung by the slaves on the plantations near the end of the day as a kind of signal to other slaves that a secret religious meeting was to be held that night, and when the slave sang “I hain’t got long to stay here,” they were thinking not of the shortness of life, but the short time before they would leave hard work to attend a pleasant religious meeting.(6) In addition to the spirituals proper, which were sung sitting down, there were what were called “running spirituals” or “shout songs.” The shouts took place on Sunday or on praise nights. When the spiritual was struck up, the African-Americans present formed a circle and shuffled around the room with a jerky movement. Sometimes they sang the chorus of the spiritual and sometimes they shuffled in silence. The monotonous thud of their feet could be heard half a mile distant.(7)\n\nThere are many other classes of African-American folk songs besides those of a religious nature. These include children’s ditties, love songs, work songs, and dances. It would be impossible to speak of them all in detail.\n\nAfter all, what is the point of describing and discussing African-American folk-music at such length? The “Literary Digest” of October 20, 1917 says, in part: “Our only original contributions to the domain of American art have come to us through our African-American population[.] In the spirituals or slave songs the African-American has given America not only its only folk songs, but a mass of noble music. How did the people who originated them manage to do it? The sentiments are easily accounted for; they are mostly taken from the Bible; but the melodies, where did they come from, some of them so strangely sweet, and others so wonderfully strong? Take, for instance “Go Down, Moses.” I doubt if there is a stronger theme in the whole musical literature of the world. African-Americans possess a valuable and much-needed gift that will contribute to the future American democracy.(8) To prove the truth of this statement, we have only to look at the effect that African-American folk music has already had on American music, and on the music of other nations. George W. Chadwick is the best known of the American composers who have used African-American themes. He made use of such themes in his second symphony. But it was a bohemian, Antonin Dvorak, who ranks the highest among composers who have used African-American music. His “New World” Symphony is based almost entirely on African-American folk-songs, and anyone who has heard it must confess that it contains some of the most beautiful melodies ever written. Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, an African of English birth, was the first African to win renown in the field of art music. He has used African themes in many charming compositions.(9) If foreign composers recognize the high worth of our African-American folk songs, surely we should do all in our power to preserve and develop what is our own American folk music.###"}
{"prompt":"How can people prevent Alzheimer's disease?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Although humanity has greatly advanced in the matter of treating various diseases, there still are health problems that neither medicine nor science has been able to solve. Cancer, HIV, Ebola, and other major illnesses kill thousands of people every year. However, there are disorders that not only influence the human body, but also twist and distort the way the human mind works. Among such diseases, one of the most often diagnosed problems is Alzheimer’s disease. It is impossible to cure, but possible to prevent; therefore, people of all ages and professions should be aware of this problem, and the ways one can avoid it—especially considering the number of misconceptions surrounding this sickness.\n\nAlzheimer’s disease generally means memory loss and the decrease of intellectual capabilities in a degree that interferes with the daily life of a patient. Unlike many people tend to think, Alzheimer’s disease is not a normal part of aging, although the majority of people suffering from it are above 65 years old; however, there are cases when people in their 50s or even 40s already show some of the symptoms. In its early stages, patients suffer a mild loss of memory, but at later stages, they lose their ability to carry on conversations and to respond to their environment. On average, it takes from eight to twenty years for the symptoms to become noticeable, depending on the patient’s age and other health conditions (Alz.org).\n\nThe development of Alzheimer’s disease is a gradual death of brain cells. The rates of degeneration are significant—the brain size of a patient with Alzheimer’s shrinks as the tissue progressively loses nerve cells and connections. Autopsies of Alzheimer’s patients show inclusions in the nerve tissue, called plaques and tangles. Plaques are found between the dying cells in the brain, and tangles are within the brain neurons, forming due to disintegration of the tau-protein (MNT). As years pass, the scales of brain cells dying grow, and it starts affecting patient’s lives directly.\n\nSymptoms of Alzheimer’s disease include losing items (usually smaller ones, such as keys); forgetting about recent events, conversations, or people whom a patient has spoken to; an inability to find the right words during a conversation; forgetting important dates, such as anniversaries; suddenly getting lost in a familiar place. Other symptoms include the disruption of thinking, reasoning, and perception. In particular, a patient may start to lose the point of a conversation or repeat themselves; they can hardly figure out the distance between themselves and other objects or people; they cannot focus on what they do, as well as they cannot perform sequential tasks, such as cooking or knitting (Alzheimer’s Society). All this makes the life of a person with Alzheimer’s much more difficult.\n\nAlthough there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, studies show that physical exercise (or physical activity, in general) may play a role in reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Also, a number of studies suggest that eating certain foods can help an individual keep their brain healthier, thus preventing the development of Alzheimer’s disease. In particular, such a preventive diet should include lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; it should be low in fat and added sugar. In particular, people who eat a “Mediterranean diet” are reported to have had a 28 percent lower risk of developing a mild cognitive impairment, and a 48 percent lower risk of progressing from this impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. All this suggests that proper nutrition can help prevent the development of Alzheimer’s disease.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the primary issues with Google Glass?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Many bloggers and journalists compose titles like, “The Future is Now.” Considering the scales of technological progress and the amazing possibilities it provides people with, it is difficult to disagree. Throughout the last decade, humanity has made a huge leap forward in terms of technology. Along with other technological wonders, there is an invention that can revolutionize the way people interact and communicate as dramatically as the Internet did back in its foundation days: Google Glass. However, its usage at the moment is connected to a number of significant problems which, at its current stage of development, are difficult to solve.\n\nThe primary issue with Google Glass is that with its help, one can easily violate the privacy of other people without them suspecting it, and creating other privacy issues for both the wearer and people around them. In particular, in the case of Google Glass, there can be no “overt act” that would signal to another person that the wearer starts or stops surveillance. With Google Glass, you can start recording information with a wink or a word, whereas a smartphone you need to hold it in your hand in a noticeable way. Therefore, it is easy for a Google Glass wearer to perform unauthorized surveillance. However, the wearer themselves is vulnerable; the later generation of Google Glass will have a function allowing constant recording, with no pauses or intervals. This means Google can record and store information about everything a person does—once again, without an owner even knowing about this (Epic).\n\nAnother problem with Google Glass is hostility towards people who (Explorers) would wear it. Considering the aforementioned problems with privacy, it is easy to understand why other people, noticing a Google Glass owner, would treat this person with distrust. In regard to this problem, Google was forced to issue special guidelines for “Explorers,” suggesting they should always ask for permission before filming other people or their property, and not use Google Glass in unsafe environments and inappropriate situations, like a date, moments of intimacy, and so on (E&T). Besides, an unexpected problem with its image appeared: people wearing Google Glass were compared to cyborgs.\n\nIn addition, the price of Google Glass was as fantastic as its concept, and combined with its lack of applications, it is obviously not contributing to its wide distribution. It is unlikely that someone would want to pay $2,000 for a gadget that does absolutely the same (and sometimes even less) than a regular smartphone, which is cheaper, easier to use, and has a wider range of customization choices (IFR).\n\nSecurity issues, distrust towards owners, and an unfair price combined with the lack of applications have led to the downfall of Google Glass on the market. If the company somehow manages to solve these issues, perhaps this technology would have a brighter future, since the idea of Google Glass is indeed revolutionary.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the challenges that foster parents face?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Being raised in a complete family, where both father and mother can provide care and support, is ideal for a child. Having one parent may be challenging for both adult and child, but still can be seen as an option of a normal family. However, there are children who—due to different reasons—have neither a mother nor father to care for them, and for them life can be difficult, as different governmental programs do not provide such children with all the support they need. Fortunately, there exists an institution of foster parenting that allows such children to receive care and attention. However, being a foster parent is not easy, and such parents often face difficulties often unfamiliar to those who raise their own children.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges foster parents face is a variety of behavior deviations that a foster child may display. Usually, problematic behavior is caused by a child’s background; many children were taken away from their blood parents due to such reasons as physical or sexual abuse, emotional violence, incarceration of one of the parents, and so on. Such events often traumatize a child psychologically, which causes them to misbehave; the degree of such misbehavior can vary, and include manifestations from bed wetting or lying to stealing, running away, or attempting violence against foster parents. What foster parents need to understand in such cases is that it takes a traumatized child an ample amount of time to get used to a stable, consistent home where no harm will be dealt to him or her; after some time, misbehavior should stop if the foster parents remain patient and caring. However, every child’s background is different—and so is the damage caused to him or her; in the worst case scenario, misbehavior can last for a lifetime (About.com).\n\nSurprisingly, one of the biggest challenges a foster parent can face is their own family and\/or friends ridicule. For many of them, it may be difficult to understand why a person would want to start taking care of a completely unfamiliar child, taking all the respective financial, personal, and other responsibilities for this child. This may cause other family members to start acting dramatic, and emotionally and\/or verbally attack the foster parent, demanding to quit caring for the child. Unfortunately, this is the last thing foster parents would want (and expect) from their closest surroundings, since being a foster parent is difficult on its own, in addition to constant battles with relatives (KiwiFamilies.co.nz).\n\nYet another significant problem for a foster parent is the necessity to take care of a child from possibly a completely different cultural and linguistic environment (NSW Government). For example, if a regular American couple agrees to take care of a boy from a family of illegal Vietnamese immigrants, they will need to solve at least two huge problems: the language barrier, and the completely different mentality of the child. People from different regions of the world have different behavioral patterns, ways of expressing emotions, moral and ethical rules, and so on. For two people born at different ends of the world, understanding each other may be extremely different.\n\nBeing a foster parent is noble. At the same time, it also means facing enormous challenges; in particular, a foster parent may have to deal with severe misbehavior, opposition from their own friends and relatives, and significant cultural and language differences. All this makes foster parenting a real feat.###"}
{"prompt":"How can a student become part of a student government?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Being a student means not only studying hard, but also actively participating in one’s social life and in the life of your campus. Being a part of a student government is a perfect chance to influence processes taking place in the educational institution you attend. However, becoming part of a student government might be harder than expected, and in order to succeed, a candidate should consider observing several recommendations.\n\nGiven that you already know what ideas and suggestions you will come up with during elections, you will need to make people know more about you. For this, you will need to prepare a set of handout materials, including flyers, posters, badges, stickers, baseball hats—whatever you can find inspiration and resources for. On these materials, your name and a photo should be present; or, in case you do not want your photo to be everywhere, use a logo. Stickers, posters, and other materials are perfect for making people remember you; even if they do not support you, your name will be heard of, and this is one of the main goals of any election campaign. If you have some of your school’s or college’s famous people among your friends, do not hesitate to mention it—this way you will make your candidacy more alluring to potential electors (just like professional politicians do). Using small gift items, like pens and key chains, is also a common idea (ULS).\n\nThe next step would be taking your election campaign to a higher level, and in these terms, going to people and making speeches is crucial. Now people know you exist, and moreover you are running for election. Your task at this point is to 1) convince people your views make sense 2) make them like you. Prepare several persuasive speeches that cover the main points of your electoral campaign; your task is to show other students that you know what needs to be done, that you know how to do this, and that you are the only one who can do this. You must look confident and competent (IFR).\n\nTaking advantage of technology would be a significant step forward as well, favorably comparing you to the other participants of the election. Creating a Facebook page, a YouTube channel, and even a personal website dedicated to your candidacy may influence the voters’ minds positively. However, it is important to comply with dignity. The Internet is a comfortable environment for all sorts of manipulations with mass consciousness, anonymous blackmailing of opponents, and so on. Do not try to win elections with the help of, for example, posting compromising photos of your opponents, fabricating negative opinions about them on the Web, or tarnishing them in some other way. Your victory must be clean and achieved only due to your persuasion skills, charisma, and competence.\n\nStudent government elections are a serious challenge for those who want to actively participate in student life. Running for elections is a serious decision that requires a proper approach. First of all, you need to make people know about you by spreading different handout materials. Next, you need to become public and known, and persuade your potential voters in the importance of what you do. Besides, you need to add credibility to your campaign by taking the advantage of technology. And perhaps the most crucial point is to play by the rules and not to tarnish opponents’ reputation (FRI).###"}
{"prompt":"What are the consequences of bullying?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" School is a difficult time for both teenagers and their parents. For adults, it is the time when they worry about how their child (or children) succeeds in studying, socializing, and what habits and manners a child adopts from peers. For children and teenagers, school is difficult not just because of having to study and to try to receive good grades, but also because there is a specific hierarchic environment they have to fit into. Those who cannot do so often become victims of bullying and being harassed by their more “successful” peers (in terms of hierarchy). Bullying has always been a serious problem for schools in the U.S., as well as in the rest of the world.\n\nAlthough some people tend to see bullying as any conflict or act of violence occurring between students, it is not so. “For instance, if two students involved in conflict are of approximately the same physical or psychological strength, the quarrel between them is not considered bullying. Bullying has two main components: repeated physical, verbal, or psychological harmful acts, and an imbalance of power. Bullying includes assault, intimidation, spreading rumors, demands for money, destruction or theft of property, name-calling, and so on. In the United States, bullying can also include sexual harassment and ostracism based on sexual orientation” (Popcenter.org).\n\nAccording to the statistics, up to 28% of U.S. students in the 6-12 grades have experienced bullying, or are feeling bullied, which makes it obvious that bullying occurs most often in middle school. Surveys disclose that name calling as the most prevalent type of bullying; next goes teasing, rumor-spreading, physical incidents, purposeful isolation, threats, belongings being stolen, and sexual harassment. Researchers believe that considering the scale of the problem, it is not enough to just promote a message like “Bullying is not tolerated”; instead, there should be effective anti-bullying programs implemented. These problems should focus on bystanders in particular, because rather often they do not do anything to prevent or stop bullying when they witness it (NoBullying.com).\n\nUnlike some teachers or officials would want to believe, bullying is not something that happens and then vanishes without a trace—it has a number of negative consequences, usually for victims. Among the most common ones, one should mention depression and anxiety; poor nutrition and\/or appetite; breaks in sleeping patterns—for example, insomnia or extreme sleepiness; excessive feelings of sadness and\/or loneliness, loss of interest in once-enjoyed activities and so on. What is even more worrying, these problems not only develop in early adolescence, but tend to last throughout the entire life of a person. Health complaints, poor grades, low levels of participation in school activities, and skipping classes are also among the reported negative effects of bullying victims. In addition, sometimes desperate victims of bullying are known to cause gunfire in schools (Stopbullying.gov).\n\nBullying is one of the most significant problems connected to the sphere of education. Bullying usually implies repeated offensive actions—verbal, psychological, or physical—against a victim, who is outnumbered, weaker, or less resilient. Up to 28% of school students in America have at least once been bullied. Such offensive behavior causes a number of long-lasting problems in victims, including depression, health problems, difficulties in communication, and so on. Therefore, immediate and effective measures against bullying are required.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some signs that a teenager is planning to run away from home?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Adolescence is the time when a person is no longer a child, but not an adult either. This, in connection with hormonal imbalances and social adaptation, often causes teenagers to do things that they later regret, or that cause inconveniences and regular disturbances to their parents. One of such things is running away from home. Although in a number of cases it can be caused by a harmful environment or a traumatizing experience, it also happens even in prosperous and harmonious families.\n\nRunning away is considered to be a serious problem in developed countries—in the U.S., in particular. According to the National Runaway Switchboard—an organization that provides psychological assistance to children who already have run away from home, or are planning to do so, approximately one teenager out of seven (the range of age is 10-18 years usually) will at least once run away, or make an attempt. Currently, there are up to three million children and teenagers living on the streets in the U.S. (Kids Health).\n\nSpecialists distinguish between episodic and chronic running away. Episodic running away mostly occurs after some significant event that has happened to a teenager, and directly or indirectly affected their decision to leave home. It may also be connected to a teenager’s attempt to avoid some consequence, humiliation, or embarrassment. Chronic running away is a more serious and complicated problem. It may be a part of acting out, or of a teenager’s strategy to gain power over the members of his or her family—a kind of manipulation or revenge. It is like a threat, “If you make me do that, I’ll run away.” In fact, this is their main problem-solving skill: if something goes wrong, they run away, thus feeling that a problem disappears (EmpoweringParents.com).\n\nAlthough it is impossible to get into another person’s mind, the good news for parents is that there are ways to detect if something is wrong with their teenager. Usually, potential runaways demonstrate a drastic change in their usual behavioral patterns, or the way they live. For example, a teen might suddenly stop eating (or on the contrary, begin to overeat), sleep all day, spend all their time outside with friends or on their own, and so on. It is important to remember that sudden mood swings mean restlessness—something is worrying such a teenager, and he or she might be planning a runaway act. Then, teenagers may start behaving in a rebellious way: breaking things at home, fighting (with peers or even family members), using explicit vocabulary, and so on. Sometimes, they might disclose their intentions, or give a hint to their parents about what they want to do (for example, “If I was not around anymore, you’d start caring about me\/wouldn’t even care, and so on). Also, a teen may start accumulating money and possessions to live on while away from home. Keeping a bag with packed things in a closet is a direct sign that a teen is planning an escape (National Runaway Safeline).\n\nTeenagers running away from homes pose a significant problem for developed countries—in particular, the U.S. Up to three million teenagers aged 10-18 live homeless because of committing a runaway. Usually, the cause of a teenager running away is specific (in this case, it is considered an episodic act). However, if a teen uses running away to manipulate their family members or solve problems, then it is considered chronic. Fortunately, parents can usually notice signs that their teenager is preparing an escape: misbehavior, rebelling, hints, and the accumulation of money and possessions may be signs of a planned runaway.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the major stress factors that college students face?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Being a college student is often considered the best period of life. However, from a certain viewpoint, it is also one of the most difficult periods in the life of an individual; the reason for this is the lack of experience, maximalism, treatment from adults, expectations, and so on. College is a perfect stress environment, as it usually incorporates multiple major stress factors, and throws it at a student all at once.\n\nCollege freshmen are, perhaps, the most vulnerable category of students. This is due to the fact that they face the social challenges that involve leaving their whole support structure behind—friends, parents, hometown, habits. Freshmen have to create new social networks, deal with having to solve their problems on their own without parents’ assistance, and so on. Naturally, this leads to stress. Additionally, bad roommates, their homework load, part-time jobs, and dealing with the dynamics of young adult relationships is incredibly difficult for people in their teenage years (About Health).\n\nLifestyle is also one of the major factors causing stress in students. Whenever we say “student life,” we usually imply unhealthy eating habits, late night parties, alcohol, a lack of sleep in favor of extensive studying and social activity, and so on. There is no doubt all this negatively affects the physical (and psychological) health of students. Chronic fatigue causes students to feel exhaustion, and negatively influences their performance or attendance in class. They have less energy for academic exercises, and may choose to skip classes or do homework less thoroughly, which can become an additional stress factor on its own (Livestrong.com).\n\nPoor work and priority organization is yet another scourge for many young men and women living and studying on campuses. They are on their own now: no teachers, parents, or relatives are going to tell them what, how, and when to do activities. Because of the lack of experience, students cannot figure out what to pay attention to, and what is not urgent at the moment; how to organize their routine; how to spend less time doing mundane tasks; how to keep a balance between private and academic life, and so on. This causes frustration, poor performance, and stress. Effective ways to help it might be keeping records on what and how you do certain activities. After you see how much time this or that activity takes, you can start planning (IFR).\n\nBeing young is not only fun, but also stressful, especially when you are a college student. New social challenges combined with the absence of a habitual support network (like family or old friends), a poor and unhealthy lifestyle, and the lack of organization, often cause frustration and stress in students. The stereotype that college life is the greatest time in one’s life might be a fallacy.###"}
{"prompt":"How can you tell if someone is lying to you?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Perhaps some of you have seen the TV show “Lie to Me.” In it, a talented psychologist solves criminal cases based entirely on the behavior of people. Whom of us would not want to be able to understand whether we are lied to, or told the truth? Fortunately, this is not science fiction, and reading body language is possible; it is not difficult, and with some extra attention and experience, you will be able to distinguish truth and lies rather often.\n\nDeception can be detected by the way a person moves. Usually, a lying person moves less freely than one telling the truth; gestures, arm and hands movements, and facial expressions become stiff. Moreover, these arm and hand movements are aimed in the direction inward to the liar, as if he or she is trying to incorporate something within themselves. Lying people often try to avoid eye contact (although in some countries, this is a sign of politeness and respect), and often touch their face, mouth, nose, ears, and so on. Also, touching their chest—a sign of sincerity—is uncommon for liars (Blifaloo).\n\nA less obvious but still effective way to catch a liar is to watch his or her eyes. According to recent studies of deception, people blink less when trying to deceive a person they talk to. Because of nervousness, liars would be expected to fidget more, but cognitive load (which is having to think about what you say—lying requires plotting) has the opposite effect. Against all expectations, in deceptive situations, liars usually behave calmer than a normal person would, and fidget less. This leads, in particular, to the effect when liars blink or move their eyes less; in fact, it is common for liars to stare at one point when talking. This is due to having to invent and\/or repeat lies, which is more difficult than truth (Time).\n\nSlow speech can also be an indicator of lying, especially combined with the two previous signs. Although many people speak slowly because it is in their nature, liars have to slow down the pace of their speech because they need to hide the truth, and invent new facts and data instead of it. It is the same cognitive load as in the case with eye movement. Due to the same reason, liars often make pauses in their speech. All this is called nonverbal communication, and it can tell you a lot about a person through how he or she says something, not what he or she says.\n\nLiars behave different from regular people when talking; usually, there are several signs, when combined, can indicate if a person is lying. Liars usually make less movements when talking, their gestures, pose, and facial expressions are stiff and tensed. Because of constantly having to think about what to say, liars do not control their micro-movements; as a result, their eyes are often still, staring at one point. Due to the same reason, they often speak slowly, with a large number of pauses. However, these are only guidelines.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the negative effects of authoritarian parenting on children?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" As a rule, parents adore their children. Apart from families with psychological, substance, or criminal problems, for every parent, a child is a significant part of his or her life. Depending on parents’ temperament, they raise their children in different ways; some try to be supportive, understanding, and friendly—others prefer to be strict and demanding, and so on. It is hard to say which parenting model is better or worse; but what is obvious is that controlling and authoritarian parenthood—unfortunately, one of the most popular parenting models—has a number of negative effects on a child.\n\nIt is important not to confuse authoritarian and authoritative parenting. The latter is about reasoning with children, combining parental love within reasonable limits for them (without excessive pressure and\/or control), responding to children’s needs and emotional reactions, and teaching, but also supporting a child in his or her initiatives. This type of parenting leads to a child growing up as an independent and self-sufficient personality. However, authoritarian parenting is the opposite; it implies control over a child’s life, demanding a child’s blind obedience with minimal explanation, a forbiddance of child’s negative emotions, little-to-no expression of warmth and care combined with high levels of demand, and so on (ParentingScience.com).\n\nAlthough authoritarian parents tend to justify their parenting style by being worried about their child’s future, in fact they should think about the fact that their behavior traumatizes a child and makes him or her vulnerable in his or her future life. Studies show that children raised in authoritarian households experience problems with social interactions; often feel obliged to conform even if they do not want to; find it hard to deal with their anger and frustration or express themselves through anger and frustration, thus directing negativity towards themselves; develop a strong fear of failure combined with low self-esteem, and so on (The Positive Parenting Centre). Also, such children may develop a denial of any authorities, thus increasing the chances of becoming a troubled teenager or a criminal.\n\nThe authoritarian parenting style is often observed in highly religious families (or even communities). Such parents often try to instill feelings in their children, such as shame or guilt, in order to be able to control them through “pinning” these feelings. “Do what I say, or you are a bad child,” “You should be ashamed for doing\/not doing this or that” are typical phrase models for such parents. In addition to shame or guilt, authoritarian parents often appeal to higher authorities, usually to their communities or God. By doing so, authoritarian parents unconsciously teach their child to pretend and to hide their true emotions and desires, conform and obey. It is important to remember, however, that even when conforming, deep inside such children might hate what they have to do, disagree with the rules and requirements; this can lead to teenage rebellion, problems with the law in adolescence and adulthood, severe family conflicts, and so on (IRF).\n\nThe authoritarian model of parenting, despite its seeming efficiency, usually leads to results opposite to those it strives to achieve. Authoritarian parenthood often implies control over a child’s life and emotions, a high level of demand combined with a low level of warmth and support, and the requirement of total obedience. This leads to a child developing a number of psychological problems such as low self-esteem, indecisiveness, poor social adaptation, and so on. In some cases, authoritarian parenting may lead a person to commit crime.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the importance of nonverbal communication?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If you live in a big city in a developed country, then you are more or less involved in different kinds of communication. Communication nowadays has become a sort of cult; daily, people maintain dozens of personal contacts—at work, in the street, public transport, and so on. Because of this, it is not only important what and how you say something to other people, but also how your body behaves in the process of communication, as body language is as informative as the spoken one, sometimes conveying information more personal and important than the one said aloud. This is called nonverbal communication.\n\nNonverbal communication includes facial expressions, gestures, the distance between speakers, eye contact, voice intonations, touch, and many other minor details which—if decrypted properly—can provide speakers with valuable details about each other. For example, space between people can say a lot about the level of intimacy between them: usually, the shorter the distance between speakers, the more friendly or intimate they are, and vice versa. Or if a person avoids eye contact, it might mean that he or she is hiding something, feels uncomfortable around you, and so on (IFR).\n\nBody language has several important functions. For instance, a person’s gestures can repeat the message he or she is making orally; a little child explaining how birds fly and waving his or her arms like wings is a decent example of this function. Another function—the opposite—is the opposite: when the way a conversationalist acts does not match with the orally-transmitted message. An example is when a person sitting with a dull face and twirling a pen in their fingers says they are interested in what you say. Substitution occurs when verbal messages can be expressed by nonverbal means (like shrugging). The function of complementing can be explained by a situation when a parent pats their child on the head for behaving well, while speaking it out loud. In addition, gestures can be used for accenting, like when raising one’s index finger when speaking about something important (HelpGuide.org).\n\nAt the same time, it is important to remember that in different cultures, norms of communication may vary; for example, in some eastern countries, looking straight in the eyes of a conversationalist is considered rude. In Caucasus, men usually communicate when gathering in large groups where everyone stands very close to each other. Men in some Arabic countries may walk around the street holding hands, or may kiss each other in cheek when greeting, but this is the indication of friendship between straight men, not romance or intimacy. Therefore, sometimes body language may also differ depending on culture (IRF).\n\nGestures are a rich layer of everyday communication, and being able to decrypt them may disclose new meanings of what people say to each other. Nonverbal communication usually includes posture, voice intonations, touch, eye contact, distance between speakers, and facial expressions. Body language messages may accent, compliment, repeat, substitute, or contradict orally spoken messages. However, depending on the culture, these messages may differ, so it is important to remember about it when communicating with people from different countries.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the reasons why teenagers might start taking drugs?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Many adults today refer to adolescence as a wonderful time, which was—even despite of its limitations—supposedly one of the best periods in their lives. Being a teenager is indeed great: you are young, a long life is ahead of you, and the world is waiting for you. However, sometimes parents face a problem: instead of enjoying youth and healthiness, their teenage son or daughter one day comes home high on pot (or something worse). If it happens once, it might be alright—teenagers often seek new experiences, and this particular case might be a mistake your teen will never repeat again. However, if a teenager is abusing substances regularly, there might be something wrong going on in his\/her life.\n\nAdolescence is the time when both young men and women seek to fit in their community, find their place in it, and be accepted. Already not a child, but still not a grown-up, a teenager looks to be treated as an adult. Without yet realizing that adulthood is about responsibility, decision making, and self-sustainability, teenagers often stick to what they believe are exterior attributions of being a grown-up: drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, and drug use. Doing this, they get into illusions, believing they are mature. Unless something bad happens to them (in the best case scenario is arrest, and in the worst case, drug addiction and rehab) they believe “bad things” happen only to other people. So, their survival instinct malfunctions, and as a result, they throw themselves into dangerous experiments with substances. Also, those teenagers who grow up with parents abusing alcohol or drugs often follow their examples: either subconsciously, or naively considering that if parents do it, then they also should (Promises.com).\n\nAs it has been said, teenagers often seek for acceptance. But compared with the acceptance by a society in general, even more important for teenagers is the acceptance of their peers. Adolescents want to fit in groups that they consider to be authoritative. Being “the only one not participating”—be it drug use, shoplifting, or other dangerous but “cool” activities—means being left out, which leads to disrespect and ostracism. In order to comply with the requirements of their surroundings, teenagers may make bad decisions, like taking drugs, to cover-up their insecurities. Thinking about the consequences is not typical for adolescents, so teenagers do not care how drug use will turn out for them or their families. Besides, teenagers want to rebel. It is a paradox, but adolescence is all about paradoxes: they want acceptance from a particular society, and they want to rebel against it. Drugs are one of the easiest ways to seem like an outlaw, to manifest neglect of social rules and norms, and so on. What teens do not realize is that drugs do not make them independent—on the contrary, doing drugs leads to addiction (Dublin City Schools).\n\nStress, boredom, and self-medication are also the reasons why many teenagers start taking drugs regularly, or at least from time to time. Adolescence is full of stresses; although adults often think it is not, as if they forgot themselves being this age. When teens feel unhappy and cannot find a healthy outlet for their excessive energy, they tend to find dangerous ways of releasing their frustration. The often rough teenage years can take an emotional toll on children, sometimes even causing depression. This is why for so many teenagers, it is hard to refuse trying out marijuana or other drugs—they seek a way to get rid of negative emotions. Unfortunately, this only makes their situation worse (DrugFree.org).\n\nAlthough adults often explain teenagers’ substance abuse in a simplified manner, like “It’s just a period,” the actual reasons for drug use by teens are usually more complicated. Craving for acceptance by their given society and especially peers, a desire to rebel and manifest aggression against accepted rules, bad examples given by parents, stress, depression, or boredom, a fear to be left out—these are just some of the reasons causing teenagers to try their first harmful substance. Thus, these wishes and motives should be paid attention to.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some common symptoms of allergies?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Medical technologies in the 21st century have become so advanced that humankind has long ago dealt with the diseases that had been considered terminal for centuries. The plague, cholera, tuberculosis, and other similar illnesses are now under control, and although they can pose danger, with the proper treatment, a patient’s life can most likely be saved. But, there are still issues modern medicine cannot completely get rid of—one of such problems is allergies.\n\nAllergies are hypersensitive responses of the immune system to substances which, in one way or another, contact the body; it may be physical contact, inhalation, exposure, or any other way of contact. An allergic person’s immune system reacts to such a substance (or substances) as if it was a dangerous pathogen, thus trying to destroy it. The mechanism is in many cases similar to, for example, the common cold or flu. Allergies are extremely common. According to public health authorities, about 20% of people in North America and western Europe have allergic rhinitis, or an allergy to pollen. According to another study, treating children’s food allergies costs the U.S. approximately 25 billion dollars annually (MNT).\n\nAs it has been mentioned, allergies are caused by specific substances; these substances are called allergens, and a wide variety of them exist. Usually, most of the allergens are eaten or inhaled. Dust, pollen, or pet dander are among the most common allergens. Peanuts, cocoa, chocolate, water—anything can be an allergen. Usually, an individual’s sensitivity to allergens vary from one person to another, so three people with nut allergies can display different reactions to the same substance (Science Daily). The mechanism of allergies is sophisticated. Most people usually possess IgE-antibodies (immunoglobulin E); this antibody normally works as a defense system against infections such as, for example, the flu. However, sometimes IgE-antibodies start responding to common environmental antigens, treating them as hostile, and for the immune system of such people, a common element of the environment becomes equal to some sort of a virus.\n\nAllergic people mostly suffer from such symptoms as a runny nose, sneezing, coughing, nettle rash, swelling, itchy eyes, sinus pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and so on. These symptoms are typical not only for allergies, but also for a wide range of diseases—therefore, it is usually necessary to consult with a doctor before starting to treat them (Allergy UK).\n\nIn the majority of cases, allergies are not mortally dangerous; however, they are common and widespread diseases, which about 20% of people in North America and western Europe have. Allergies are caused by allergens—usually safe substances or elements of the environment, which a person’s immune system treats as infectious. Common symptoms of allergies are similar to the symptoms of a number of other illnesses, so before treating these symptoms, it is advised to visit a doctor.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the risks of teenage pregnancy?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" To understand which problems worry first world countries the most today, it is usually enough to check the headlines in major newspapers. Although mass media tends to pay a lot of attention to one problem while completely ignoring others, still referring to them is a sound way to learn about major social, political, and cultural issues. Today, along with news about diplomatic scandals, wars, epidemics, and economic crises, headlines are often dedicated to teen pregnancy, which is a real scourge of modern American society.\n\nBy teen pregnancy, experts usually understand it to be pregnancy among young women between the ages of 15 and 17 years. In 2013, on average, 13 teens out of 1,000 peers were pregnant. According to recent studies, teen pregnancies have declined in the United States, but the teenage representatives of some social and\/or ethnic groups seem to be in the risk zone; for example, African-American and Hispanic teens in the U.S. are two to three times more likely to become pregnant than Caucasian teens. Moreover, it is reported that nearly one in five teen births is a repeat birth, which means that pregnancy for these teens is not a first time occurrence (HealthCommunities.com).\n\nBut what risks do teenage to-be mothers face? In fact, being a teenage mother is truly difficult, even compared to regular pregnancy. For example, teens are at a high risk of not getting appropriate prenatal care, as they are often afraid to tell their parents about their pregnancies, and cannot afford prenatal care themselves. Pregnant teens often get high blood pressure, or pregnancy-induced hypertension, as well as preeclampsia much more often than pregnant women who are in their 20s or 30s. Teens are also more likely to give birth to premature babies, meaning that the pregnancies do not last for the regular 40 weeks; also, teenage mothers are exposed to higher risks of having low-birth-weight babies (usually 1,500 to 2,500 grams, and sometimes even less). A very-low-birth-weight baby weighs less than 3.3 pounds. Among other risk factors for teen mothers are STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases), postpartum depression, and so on (WebMD).\n\nAlong with health problems, teenage mothers are usually less likely to finish high school, which decreases their chances to get adequate higher education, and then find a job to sustain themselves, and their child. It means, in its turn, that teenage mothers are more likely to live in poverty, be a single parent (and also divorce if they get married to the father of their child). Also, since teenage pregnancy is often unwanted and unexpected, teenage mothers are often more likely to abuse or neglect their babies (Sutter County).\n\nTeenage pregnancy is a complicated modern phenomenon that requires the attention of governmental and non-governmental organizations, psychologists, and first of all, parents. Although the tendency of teenage pregnancy in the U.S. seems to be gradually decreasing, certain ethnic and\/or social groups still remain vulnerable to this phenomenon. Becoming pregnant as a teenager leads to a number of health problems (such as preeclampsia, high blood pressure, STDs, depression, and so on), as well as to social consequences, such as divorce, a low quality of life, child abuse, and so on.###"}
{"prompt":"How does procrastination negatively affect a person's life?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Have you been in a situation when you had a deadline approaching, and there was still a lot of work to do, but instead of doing your best to catch up on time, you watched YouTube clips and browsed random websites? If yes, then you are one of the hundreds of millions procrastinators. This word, procrastination, has become rather popular recently, and people use it eagerly. But is procrastination some sort of modern sickness, or is it trivial laziness?\n\nProfessor Clarry Lay, a psychologist writer who researches the issue of procrastination, believes procrastination occurs when there is “a temporal gap between intended behavior and enacted behavior,” which means a significant time period between the moment when a person was intending to do a task and started doing it. So, if instead of doing something you should focus on, you prefer doing something more enjoyable at the moment, then you are procrastinating (MindTools).\n\nProcrastination is not so harmless as it might seem at first glance. The Procrastination Research Group at Carleton University in Canada asked 2700 interviewees to answer the question, “To what extent is procrastination having a negative impact on your happiness?” 46% replied that procrastination affects happiness “quite a bit,” and even “very much,” and 18% of the respondents believed procrastination has an “extreme negative effect” on their lives and happiness. Procrastinators usually estimate time poorly, focus on the past instead of the present, and do not act on their intentions; this is usually connected to low self-esteem, an inability (or unwillingness) to compete with others, perfectionism, self-deception or self-confidence, anxiety, and so on (Success Consciousness).\n\nThere are ways, however, to deal with procrastination, or at least to minimize time spent unproductively. A person should be aware of the triggers that make them procrastinate—usually it is a complicated task, or a vast amount of work. Next, procrastinators should consider applying several of the numerous time-management techniques, and find motivation that would encourage them to complete “dangerous” tasks on time. They should constantly be aware of the possibility to roll back to procrastination, and develop techniques that help them complete tasks on time.\n\nProcrastination is not equal to laziness. It is a tendency to postpone doing work or completing important tasks in favor of more pleasant activities. According to studies, procrastination can greatly harm the feeling of happiness of a procrastinator, and is usually connected to perfectionism, low self-esteem, self-deception, and other similar psychological traits. Fortunately, there are ways to deal with procrastination, such as awareness, time management, and motivation.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the significance of Planck length?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" As science has developed and researchers have gotten the opportunity to explore the micro-world of atoms, an urge for new units of measurement has emerged. In 1889, a German physicist, Max Planck, introduced his system of lengths, which included many of the measurement units we operate with today, including the shortest length in the world: Planck length.\n\nProviding someone with a visual image of such a small length is, perhaps, an impossible task. Planck length is only 1.6 x 10 meters squared by negative 35 meters; if you know the size of a proton, try to imagine something that would be 10-20 times smaller—and it will be Planck length (PhysLink.com). In case you are not familiar with mathematics, it means that Planck length is 1000000000000000000000 times smaller than a proton.\n\nWhat is it needed for? When developing his system, Max Planck was trying to come up with a way to define measurement units that depended on constants of the universe, not on a system of measurement or relative lengths. Usually, we measure lengths either in feet or in meters, which often causes confusion; Planck was looking for units that would not depend on the way one measures something (FermiLab Today).\n\nPlanck length is a crucial component of the equation that describes the entropy in black holes, offered by Stephen Hawking and Jacob Bekenstein. In the theory of strings, it is considered that the Planck length corresponds to the size of the “strings,” of which all the particles in the standard model are thought to consist of (fromquarkstoquasars.com). Even if string theory is wrong, Planck length will not lose its value, because, as Planck said himself about his discoveries, “These necessarily retain their meaning for all times and for all civilizations, even extraterrestrial and non-human ones, and can therefore be designated as “natural units” (Fermilab Today).\n\nPlanck length is the smallest length among those that are known to humanity at present. It is 1.6 x 10 meters squared by negative 35 meters, which is about 10-20 times smaller than a proton. Max Planck developed this length as a measurement unit that would be independent from any measurement system, and would only depend on the constants of the universe. Planck length is now actively used in quantum physics—particularly, in the theory of strings—and it seems that its value to science will never fade.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the components of the perfect world according to young people?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" During recent years, many Hollywood movies dedicated to all kinds of utopian or dystopian future societies have been released; in literature, the dystopian genre has also become quite popular among adults and especially teenagers in the U.S. But what about the world that young people would like to live in?\n\nAccording to recent studies by Dr. Alice Freidenhsrauer, the majority of young people connect the future world with the intense development of technologies (FaResearch.net) Usually, they describe their perfect version of the future as a world where Internet-based technologies are integrated in daily life so much that there is no perceived difference between virtual reality and the real world. For example, Dr. Freidenhsrauer gives an example of Tony Herbenson, a 19-year-old student from Silverton College of Arts, who described the future he would like to live in as a place where technologies have become as natural as speech or sight; Tony suggested that in the future, people will implant certain gadgets in their bodies—for example, communication devices, which allow the immediate access to the Internet, or to virtual (enhanced) reality, and so on. This reminds of the ideas of transhumanists, who believe that merging technologies with the human body would be a natural stage of evolution for humankind.\n\nAnother research study conducted by the IFR Institute showed that among people between 16 and 26 years old said that one of the crucial components of the perfect world they would like to live in is peace and welfare. By peace, the respondents meant the absence of wars—either global or local, and by welfare they implied mostly health. After the recent media panic around Ebola, many young people consider health safety to be crucial for well-being, rather than money or success. Young people hope scientists will soon manage to find cures for such major diseases as cancer, HIV, and Ebola. Also, young people expect humanity to solve the problem of hunger and overpopulation.\n\nRecent studies in Silverton, co-conducted by the SAN Institute in 2013, show the perfect world for young people is impossible without having solved ecological problems. Global warming seems to be the problem that worries young middle-class Americans significantly; about 34% of respondents believe the current ecological situation affects their health and mental condition directly; 40% think bad ecology might have a connection to certain causes of sickness they had in the past, or have now. Only 10% of respondents do not believe ecology affects them in any way. So, “a clear sky above the head” is also a part of how young people see a perfect world.\n\nThe idea of a perfect world is not new; recently, it has become rather popular in cinema and literature. At the same time, young people have their own set of images and requirements towards the future. They include expectations for advanced communication technologies to become an integral part of everyday life; curing major diseases and solving such problems as hunger and overpopulation; and the end to global warming. Therefore, we may imply that the vision of modern young Americans reflects the existing social tendencies rather accurately.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the consequences of animal cruelty?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Before human beings became the dominant species across the globe, animals were the masters of Earth. Today, animals need to be protected and preserved from extinction, of which humankind can be the first reason. And while the majority of the human population realizes the importance of a humane attitude towards animals and the protection of their rights, cruelty to animals still exists.\n\nIf you check the webpage of RSPCA Australia (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), you will find a list of actions and conditions that can be qualified as cruelty to animals. The list includes such points as torturing or beating an animal; failing to provide it with food and appropriate treatment in case of disease or injury; killing an animal in an inhumane manner; failing to provide appropriate transportation conditions, and so on (RSPCA). As it can be noticed, cruelty to animals is defined based on specific criteria that allow us to evaluate the way an animal is treated.\n\nAccording to statistics, animals who suffer from cruelty most often are dogs (64.5%) and cats (18%). 25% are for other animals, such as horses (The Humane Society). Supposedly, it means domestic pets are the most vulnerable category to suffer from cruelty; also, it might mean cruelty towards animals is a result of pet owners demonstrating their anger, frustration, or stress on the closest and most defenseless creatures (this can be a proof in favor of the aforementioned conduct disorder).\n\nUndoubtedly, there are people who mistreat animals because of their own misfortunes, twisted personalities, mental illnesses, ignorance, or indifference. According to The American Psychiatric Association, animal cruelty is “one of the diagnostic criteria of conduct disorder.” The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) defines conduct disorder as “a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age appropriate societal norms or rules are violated (CFAWR).” In practice, it means animal abusers—those who treat animals cruelly—are likely to commit certain forms of crime and abuse towards people as well, which is a disturbing sign for sure.###"}
{"prompt":"How has Christmas changed in different countries over time?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Christmas is coming, and most children are probably waiting for Santa to come to their homes and deliver gifts for them. It would not be an exaggeration to say Christmas has long ago lost its religious meaning for the majority of participants in this holiday and has turned into some kind of family celebration with presents and dinner. However, this is true mostly for the United States (and perhaps Great Britain), but what about other countries? Although not all the world is Christian (and Christmas is a Christian holiday), many nations celebrate it annually, each in a different way.\n\nCountries of the European Union have different traditions regarding Christmas. For example, if you ever go to Sweden or Norway on Christmas, you will be surprised to discover how people of these countries prefer porridge to cookies. In Netherlands, Santa Claus comes not from the North Pole, but from Spain, using a steam boat, and his assistant is not an elf, but a guy named Black Peter (parentdish.co.uk). Italian people put up scenes of Christ’s nativity in churches, city squares, and homes. However, rather often, Italians exchange gifts on January 6th (kids-world-travel-guide.com). In Ukraine, Christmas is also celebrated not on December 25th, but on January 7th, which is connected to a different calendar that is used by the Orthodox Church for religious dates. Until Christmas Eve, people usually fast for 39 days, and then have a 12-course supper in honor of the 12 apostles (todayifoundout.com).\n\nAs for Asian countries, in Japan, for example, Christmas is considered to be a time to share one’s good mood and happiness with other people. As most Japanese people are not Christians, this holiday in Japan has no religious connotations. Japanese couples usually see Christmas Eve as a romantic occasion to spend time together, go to a restaurant, or have a walk, so it is somewhat similar to St. Valentine’s Day (which is, in its turn, super popular in Japan). Besides, unlike the United States, Christmas in Japan is not an official holiday, so companies work as usual, and the traditional Christmas food is cake and chicken (whychristmas.com).\n\nChristmas is celebrated even in India, although there it possesses some national specifics. For example, instead of pine trees, Indians decorate their homes with mango leaves; they also decorate mango or banana trees the same way as we do with pine trees. Also, Indian people like to put burning oil lamps on flat rooftops—this symbolizes the light Jesus brings to the world (thenorthpole.com).\n\nAlthough Christmas was originally a Christian holiday, it has spread all over the world, and has become a popular and a favorite holiday in many countries. According to Christian ideals, Christmas brings peace and unity in the homes of people across the world, and regardless of how people decorate their homes or what they do on this occasion, the holiday still remains one of the main annual events for many families across the globe.###"}
{"prompt":"How can people be so gullible as to believe in astrology when it has been proven to be false?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Living in the 21st century means living in the age of technological wonders, allowing people to do things that would be considered magic a century ago. Television, the Internet, cell phones, space flights, bullet trains, virtual reality, and holographic and three-dimensional images are just several examples demonstrating the incredible technological progress humanity has made during recent decades. Simultaneously, many people still believe in awkward and sometimes absurd phenomenons, like superstitions, magic, astrology, and so on. Especially this thesis refers to astrology; although many people claim horoscopes for their zodiac signs are “absolutely true,” science proves it is only a matter of perception.\n\nIf you have ever read a horoscope for the zodiac sign you were born under, you must have noticed that sometimes “predictions” about your personality traits, lifestyle, relationships, or career can somehow seem to be exact. Fortunately, this does not mean that distant stars and planets somehow affect your destiny; much more likely, in such cases, you are experiencing what is called the Barnum Effect.\n\nGenerally, the Barnum Effect (also called the Forer Effect) means people’s tendency to take vague and generalized characteristics of themselves as accurate and truthful (Paranormality). Or, in other words, it means that people accept characteristics that can apply to many people as personal and accurate only for themselves.\n\nHere is a psychological characteristic composed of the statements used by the American psychologist Bertram Forer in the experiment that proved the effect. He provided each of his students with the following text, and each of the students recognized it to be his or her precise psychological characteristic:\n\nYou have a great need for other people to like and admire you. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage. While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. Your sexual adjustment has presented problems for you. Disciplined and self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others’ statements without satisfactory proof. You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic. Security is one of your major goals in life. (Forer)\n\nAs you can see, the statements above can be more or less applied to almost anybody. No need to say that horoscopes usually consist of phrases that to a significant extent resemble (or even repeat) those in the presented text. Sometimes, horoscopes can be completely accurate. For example, a Gemini writer may read that his or her sign is prone to writing and\/or literary work. But such cases are either coincidences (not every Gemini in real life is a writer, or at least talented in writing), or illustrate a person’s ability to find particularities in vagueness.\n\nAstrology and horoscopes should not be trusted. Although some of the predictions may seem incredibly accurate, this is an illusion caused by the peculiarities of how our minds work. People tend to accept generalized characteristics as accurate and applicable to themselves; this is called the Barnum (Forer) Effect, and it is responsible for making use see horoscopes as something credible.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the symptoms of Ebola and how is it transmitted?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Currently, the world is facing an epidemic due to what is considered to be among the most dangerous viruses that humanity has ever faced: the Ebola hemorrhagic virus. Though there were announcements about experimental cures that were reported to be successful in terms of treating the virus, people around the world continue to die from Ebola. Though this virus is lethal, its symptoms are sometimes the same as less dangerous diseases, such as fever or flu. To settle anxiety about the spread of this virus, it is important to know what humanity currently deals with in terms of this epidemic.\n\nEbola was first discovered 1976 in Africa, on the banks of the Ebola river, after which the virus has been named. Back then, there were two major outbreaks of the virus, and this is how people learned about it. There exist several strains of the Ebola virus, some of them are deadly to people, and some are not.\n\nThe main symptoms of Ebola can appear in a period between the second and the 21st days of contamination, but usually it happens on the eighth through 10th day (CDC). Among the symptoms that appear in the first turn, one should mention fever and chills, strong headaches, pain in joints and muscles, and general weakness. These symptoms are not too different from those that people usually experience when catching a severe cold, or flu, so victims may even ignore these symptoms, or try to treat them as a common sickness. However, as the virus keeps progressing, a patient develops nausea with vomiting, diarrhea, chest and stomach pains, red eyes and rashes over the body, severe weight loss, and bleeding from almost all bodily orifices (Mayo Clinic).\n\nThe virus is usually transmitted either through blood or through waste. Contagion through blood usually takes place if a person consumes infested meat, or even touches it (for example, butchering can also lead to contamination). Also, there were cases when people got infected after stepping in feces of infected mammals, mostly bats (Mayo Clinic). The other ways of getting infected is through skin by receiving bodily fluids through pores.\n\nEven though there is no specific cure from Ebola, doctors still try to treat it. In order to diagnose Ebola, doctors usually take tests on such diseases as cholera or malaria, because it is difficult to diagnose Ebola based solely on symptoms. After the diagnosis has been made, doctors start treating the symptoms, which includes eliminating infected cells, electrolytes, blood pressure medication, blood transfusions, oxygen therapy, and so on (WebMD).\n\nThough Ebola is a highly dangerous disease, it is not likely that it will spread globally. It is most deadly in anti-sanitary conditions, which many African countries are notorious for. As for first world countries, even though there is still no universal cure, they are at much lesser risk than African countries. Though the symptoms of Ebola are severe and getting infected is not difficult, with the correct handling of an outbreak, the virus should not be able to spread.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the most common causes of the common cold?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Summer is gone, and now it is the middle of autumn. Despite that it is a beautiful season, favored by poets and creative people in general, it is also the time when the weather changes, and gets colder. Many people in autumn may wake up and discover their noses are stuffed, and their throats ache; the most unlucky of them feel fever and chills. These are the most common symptoms of the common cold, and since it is only getting colder, it is useful to figure out what exactly causes the common cold to be able to avoid it.\n\nMost people think the common cold is caused by cold weather, since it sounds logical and obvious. However, cold itself does not cause sickness, which is easily proved by people who can swim in ice-cold water, or by those who are less sensitive to cold weather. The most typical cause of the cold, however, is a family of viruses called rhinoviruses (HowStuffWorks). A rhinovirus is transmitted through air, so when an infected person sneezes, and you inhale the air nearby, you may get infected as well (this is one of the reasons why doctors sometimes recommend to wear face masks in public places when it is cold outside). The virus can be transmitted in some other ways as well, like through handshakes (and touching in general).\n\nAnother kind of virus responsible for people getting the common cold is a family of so called coronaviruses. It is believed these viruses usually cause about 20 percent of colds. Coronaviruses usually affect the nose, sinuses, and\/or upper throat. Though this type of virus is not too dangerous, there have been cases when it has caused serious danger and death. For example, in 2012, close to 100 people in the Middle East died from what was called MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Coronaviruses are also known to have caused severe acute respiratory syndrome, and some other illnesses that have lethal consequences (WebMD).\n\nThe respiratory syncytial virus is also among the main causes of the cold. RSV usually affects infants, and in the majority of cases does not lead to anything more serious than the common cold. Yet, it can cause pneumonia in rare cases, so parents should be aware of this sickness (WebMD).\n\nOn the whole, the common cold is not a threat to modern humanity. If a person has a strong immune system, their body can even deal with the illness on its own; however, this is rare, and it is still highly recommended to visit a doctor after noticing the symptoms of a cold. Viruses causing the common cold are usually transmitted through air, and usually do not cause serious sickness. However, some types of coronavirus, such as MERS or SARS, are known to have caused deaths in the past. RSV in particular can be a threat for infants, due to its capability to cause pneumonia in rare cases. But in general, timely treatment eliminates all the symptoms and the sickness itself.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of living a year without purchasing anything?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Today, it seems almost impossible that a person can live in a big city without purchasing anything. City dwellers are constantly surrounded with many possible kinds of goods, services, and entertainment. Without even realizing it, people tend to waste significant amounts of money on almost worthless purchases, like drinks at a bar, or cinema tickets, or shopping. However, two people from Calgary, Canada, managed not only to realize it, but also broke free from the circle of infinite consumption. Their experiment lasted a year, and was called the Buy Nothing Year.\n\nGeoffrey Szuszkiewicz and Julie Phillips, an accountant and a communication adviser, started to calculate their profits and expenditures; at some point, they realized they were spending a lot of money on objects and services they did not need. For instance, Geoffrey would spend about $150 monthly (Julie would spend $250) on a haircut in a salon, and Julie would regularly go to restaurants and bars with her friends (Forbes).\n\nSo, to avoid unnecessary expenditures, Geoffrey and Julie started to live together (she rented a room in his apartment), and phased out all objects they used to spend money on. Chemicals for household chores, gas, dining out, getting haircuts in salons, and other activities and purchases people in Calgary get used to making turned out to require huge amounts of money. Geoffrey and Julie sought for alternatives; for example, they walked or biked instead of using their cars. Gradually, they learned how to live without purchasing items that almost any citizen considers necessary; they only went to grocery stores to buy food.\n\nWhen the Buy Nothing Year project had run to its end, Geoffrey and Julia calculated their savings. It turned out during the year, Geoffrey had saved $42,300. Julie, in her turn, had saved $13,800. Both of them say they have obtained many useful skills throughout the year: to live only on what is necessary, frugality, managing money, and other useful traits that will help them care about money less, and focus on what they like doing.\n\nGeoffrey’s and Julie’s experience demonstrates how even living in a developed country, where advertising and consumption have reached its peak, a person can still remain mindful and maintain control over his or her expenditures. Social responsibilities and communication seem to be closely connected with spending money—dining out with friends, sitting in bars, going to the cinema, and so on and thus refusing them may be difficult. But, the outcomes are worth the risk.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the major expenses for American teenagers and what do they reveal about teenage culture in the United States?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Adolescence is the time when an individual shifts from being a child to being an adult, ready to take on responsibilities, and face the challenges of the real world. At the same time, adolescence is also the time for having fun and treating life in probably the most relaxed way ever, which does not automatically mean irresponsibility. Though many adults believe American teenagers spend money mostly on entertainment, research shows this is not true.\n\nSurprisingly, American teenagers spend much less money on video games or concerts as it is usually considered. According to a semiannual report issued by Piper Jaffray in April 2014, the major part of teenagers’ expenditures goes to food (Business Insider). Indeed, as the graph from the report shows, American teenagers eagerly spend about 21% of their money on food, mostly at Starbucks.\n\nThe latter fact seems to be somehow connected to the new trend in U.S. teenage culture, which is hanging out in restaurants rather than in malls. For example, in 2014, American teenagers visited malls on average 29 times, compared to 38 times in 2007. As the report propounds, “Restaurants have become a gathering place and teens are increasingly suggesting they prefer dining out to other forms of status brand spending. We see restaurants as the next generation hang out for teens.” The supposed mall culture seems to be waning in favor of more class (Quartz).\n\nAlong with food, American teens spend approximately equal amounts of money on clothes. Mostly, they give preference to athletic wear rather than denim apparel. Teenagers in the U.S. seem to be preferring the “athleisure”—clothing which can be worn both inside and outside of gyms. Athleisure preferred in 2014 is manufactured by such brands as Adidas, Lululemon, Juicy Couture, Athleta, and some others (Business Insider).\n\nOther expenditures are more or less divided between cars, shoes, gadgets, events and entertainment, and healthcare. Thus, American teens are reported to spend about 10% of their money on personal care, 8% on cars and gadgets respectively, about 7% on video games, and 6% on music, movies, and events such as concerts, respectively. However, the amount of money young people spend on books and magazines is dramatically low: just about 2% of the money they possess (Piper Jaffray).\n\nThe mentioned report gives reasons to assume American teenagers in 2014 pay a lot of attention to their status and fashion, which is illustrated by their choices of places for hanging out (restaurants instead of malls), and their striving to follow fashion trends. At the same time, teenagers seem to pay little attention to their intellectual development, as they spend comparatively little money on books, movies (which can also be contributing to personal growth), and magazines. In the age of the Internet, this cannot be the only criteria to make such conclusions, but it still makes a contrast with what is important and trendy in American teenage culture: status and fashion.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the evidence for the existence of God?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It seems the arguments for proving or disproving God’s (or a god’s) existence will never be pinned down as absolute truths. Most of the time, one becomes an atheist or a person of faith based on a form of logic or a type of emotion that is personally attractive, though this logic or emotion cannot be said to be absolute truth (Harper, 12). Through logic and emotion, both sides of the argument for divinity and a lack of divinity can be “proven.” For me, music has been one of the pieces of evidence for the existence of God or a god.\n\nWhen I listen to Sufi music, particularly qawwali music, I get into states of ecstasy and feelings of mystic transformation. Sufism is a mystical sect of Islam that places great importance on music as a tool to put people in a state of oneness with the divine. In qawwali music, the words of saints are combined with infectious rhythms and soaring melodies. When a listener tunes into a qawwali willingly, many times the listener will at some point feel a transformation in his or her consciousness, which could be said to be like feeling the rhythm of the Universe, or a feeling of oneness having spiritual tones (Garge, 10).\n\nThis occurred to me often while listening to a particular maestro of qawwali music, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. I am not a Muslim, or a Sufi, but was curious to hear something new when I first received a CD of the acclaimed singer from an aunt of mine. I had been listening to mostly alternative rock music, and a first listening of Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan surprised me and gave me immediate awe. There was something in his voice that had a certain substance I could not deny. Later, I realized this substance was the mystic devotion the singer expressed and of which I felt keenly with many listenings.\n\nThis might not sound entirely scientific, as it cannot be tested or observed strictly (as of now), but its effects and the experiences that are a result of those effects are difficult to deny if they happen to one personally. And it is not just me experiencing regular effects of ecstasy listening to Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s music—thousands of listeners lay claim to feel a sense of spiritual fulfillment while enjoying his music (Byth, 32). And surprisingly, many of the people who claim this are neither religious or spiritually-minded. It seems people get mystically hypnotized by Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s music whether or not it was intended to.\n\nThere may never be any proof for or against God’s or a god’s existence, or whether we would know what this proof could possibly be. But when I listen to Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s riveting vocals, it brings me into a state of ecstasy and I feel I am getting in contact with the eternal spirit the mystics talked about and still talk about. I may be hallucinating each time I listen to this music, without the usage of drugs, but I choose to believe this is highly improbable. Rather, I accept this music expresses divinity and this expression can be felt by the listeners of this music.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the definition of art?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The definition of art is subjective, though famous art critics propose they know what “good” art is. What can we say about art, though, when galleries exhibit such sculptures as a Virgin Mary covered in cow dung, and it is being lauded? What is the border between art and an attempt at art? Questions such as these have been asked for thousands of years, and it seems these inquiries will never be answered objectively (Jorque, 131). One definition of art, however, has prevailed since its inception: it is what is pleasing to the senses. The word ‘pleasing’ can be misleading, as what is pleasing to one individual has the possibility of not being pleasing to another. Thus, it is what is pleasing to each individual—but this is still a vague definition, as it encompasses many concepts. Take for example, eating a great meal at a fancy restaurant. It is pleasing to the senses, but is this art? Some would state in the positive, specifically those adhering to the Neo Sense artist movement.\n\nEven though this definition of art is subjective, it states how it affects individuals personally in a poignant way. Even if, say, an art admirer enjoys pondering over grotesque forms of art others might consider revolting, this is his or her sense of what is pleasant (Lorde, 23). What would not be art would be based on an individual’s concept of pleasing (Lorde, 18).\n\nThus, the art critic has no place in the Neo Sense movement in terms of the one-on-one assessment of art. “Good” and “bad” art is not in the equation when referring to it as solely being a phenomenon that pleases on an individual basis (Kiln, 16). This is not to say art critics are not necessary—they are expressing their own view of what pleases them or not, though their statements are not entirely substantiated.\n\nWhat does this mean for the artist itself when adhering to the Neo Sense movement? It means the definition of pleasing is entirely up to them. However, artists cannot discount what has influenced them to think and feel in the way they do about how they appreciate one aesthetic over another (Kiln 89). What pleases someone is a combination of personal discovery and an absorption of what has pleased others (Klacsansky, 67).\n\nThe definition of art has never been easy to pin down. The Neo Sense movement may have happened upon a universal definition of it, though. As perceived by the movement, art is what pleases us personally, even if it means it may be horrid to others. Each person is a judge of art; each person is the only artist in the world. An artist makes what is art for him or her. It is a personal perception—no more, no less.###"}
{"prompt":"How does our understanding of space and time change when considering the smallest scales of existence?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" At the smallest scales of existence, our conceptions of space and time are irrelevant. Say if we went through smaller and smaller scales of our bodies, we would find that eventually we would arrive at Planck length (Roper, 131). To imagine the size of Planck length, consider that a hydrogen atom is 10 trillion trillion Planck lengths across. At this scale, time and space as we know it can no longer can be understood.\n\nSo what does that mean in terms of understanding ourselves? Well, we can rightly say that yes, we do have time and space according certain scales of ourselves (larger than Planck length), but as for our ultra-minuscule selves, the essential matter of who we are, our comprehension of existence breaks down (Joplin, 12).\n\nWho would we be without space and time? Some people might say we would be nothing, while others might say we would be like virtual particles, popping in and out of existence—which is a little bit more than nothing, though it cannot be said to strictly exist. It would mean we exist and do not exist simultaneously. This idea corresponds to my next point: that any question we ask can be answered in many ways.\n\nThe answer to any question is ambiguous when trying to state exacting truth (Hopp, 45). Take a simple question for an example: “What is your name?” My name is Nicholas David Klacsanzky according to law, but my name could be any number of names that I have attached to my identity, and others have given me. Is my lawful name my true and only name? That is up for interpretation. And in fact, any statement of supposed “truth” can be unraveled to show that there is another way to look at it.\n\nThere is a Zen aphorism that goes along like this, “To speak is to make a mistake.” This is said with the idea that the truth cannot be spoken, as truth is all-encompassing and even beyond being—it would have to be spoken about in terms that do not exist in language in order for the reality of the truth to be perceived through language (which is a paradox).\n\nSo, truth is an experience. I believe this is why Socrates said, “I know only of my own ignorance,” and made the people at the top of ancient Greek society confused about their basic concepts of their existence. We cannot understand reality through mental concepts: only through our pure experience without the obstruction of mental activity.\n\nWithout the interruption and clouding of reality by mental processes, existence is clear. We do not need to understand anything in order to know existence as it is. In fact, the only way we can perceive reality is by giving up trying to understand and giving up “understanding” itself. Then we can witness life in all its profound simplicity.###"}
{"prompt":"How would our perception of reality change if we did not experience it through terminology?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What would the world be like without names, terms, or definitions? Would we, human beings, experience life differently? I believe we would perceive our sensory experiences in a dramatically different way if we did not witness our reality through ingrained terminology. The major shift in our consciousness from perceiving without the filter of definitions would be that we would no longer analyze our surroundings, but rather experience separate entities as a whole.\n\nAs infants, we do not know the difference between ourselves and others (Hammond, 34). It is our most natural state to not know what separates us. But as the awareness of individuality comes in, we start thinking we are distant from what we perceive. We have to ask ourselves if this sense of identity is the truth of our existence, though. For if it is not, then that carries many implications.\n\nIf what we experience is not separated by definitions, a rose might as well as be ourselves, and vice-versa. In physics, we know the shift of a single electron, say within an atom of a diamond, will affect the entire Universe (Sawyer, 435). This is due to the Universe having to compensate for the shift of the electron. From this viewpoint, we can see that a single action from one entity affects the entire spectrum of existence, and is therefore not separate.\n\nAnother implication we can consider is how we see ourselves. If we know we are not just our identity, but the Universe itself, we can gain a profound understanding of who we actually are. Taking this standpoint, we then would be all the matter and energy that comprises existence, which would make us feel grand and small simultaneously. We are grand because we are a vast collection of illusory identities (given identification, but in fact whole), but we are small because we are just one thing. As one thing, size does not matter, nor any other distinction.\n\nIn Zen philosophy, emptiness is everything that is and what everything returns to through its illusory existence (Klacsanzky, 981). It is that something that cannot be described, as the best definition of it would be nothing, which is actually something. There can never be truly nothing, yet neither can there be truly something. For an example of the concept of nothingness, I will provide a short story. A Zen monk came up to Bodhidharma, the founder of Zen, and asked him a question along the lines of, “If everything is emptiness, then how do we exist?” Bodhidharma then hit the monk on the head, and the monk winced in pain and understood later that saying exclusively that everything is empty is false. For explaining why there cannot be something, we can look at the most basic components of what makes up anything, which is essentially virtual particles that pop in and out of existence.\n\nApplying definitions to what we perceive helps us to interact with each other and the world around us―yet these definitions ultimately are not true. By understanding we are a single whole can have significant implications on the knowledge of who we are and how we comprehend our surroundings. We can know that each action that takes place affects everything else, how grand and minuscule we are, and the conundrum of existence of itself. But within this complexity, there is a sea of peace in knowing we cannot understand the fundamentals of life, and everything is simply as it is.###"}
{"prompt":"How has Stephen Hawking's life and work changed the way people perceive scientists and astronomy?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Astronomy (and astrophysics) has been continually connected directly to the world’s mysteries that have intrigued humanity throughout history. Before the advent of modern physics, people were offered dogmatic religious explanations of the Universe’s structure; however, such scientists as Galileo and Newton had completely changed the way the world had usually been perceived. Since their discoveries were made, the picture of the world we live in became more complicated, so that today it can be almost entirely understood perhaps only by scientists. Fortunately, there are people who make knowledge about the Universe accessible for everybody who wants to learn more about it. Such people are geniuses, as they often manage to explain phenomenally-difficult concepts in accessible language; one such person is Stephen Hawking—a great scientist and a gregarious personality.\n\nStephen Hawking, a mastermind in physics, astrophysics, and other complicated branches of science that I have only a faint of an idea about, was born in 1942. Surprisingly, at school the future genius had not been a brilliant student—his academic successes back then were rather mediocre (HowStuffWorks). However, when it came to entering a university, young Hawking had displayed a perfect score in physics, which had won him an Oxford scholarship. University professors had also recognized him as an non-diligent student; however, he received a first-class honors degree at Oxford, and started his graduate work in Cambridge (Special Education Degrees).\n\nAs a student, despite of being a member of the rowing team in Oxford, Hawking experienced increasing clumsiness and problems with controlling his body. Those were the first symptoms of a disease that later would change his life—amyotrophic lateral sclerosis—which has made him almost completely paralyzed. Despite all the difficulties the disease has caused him, Hawking has not given up; moreover, throughout his life, he did more than a regular healthy person would do.\n\nWhat is the most fascinating aspect about Stephen Hawking is his will power. Honestly, how many people would have not given up if they were diagnosed with ALS? However, Hawking not only continued his scientific work (despite being given just a few years to live when he was 21), but accomplished a number of great tasks, and made an invaluable contribution to science. Stephen Hawking wrote a number of world-famous books, which is already remarkable for a person who can only communicate with others with the help of a voice modulator. Besides, these books are dedicated to the most complicated problems that science (cosmology, in particular) has ever faced; however, Hawking managed to explain them (or at least bring the readers up to date) in simple words, with his own style and sophisticated humor.\n\nStephen Hawking, regardless of his circumstances, manages to live a more fulfilled life than people usually do. He is the director of research at the Cambridge Center for Theoretical Cosmology. He is the author of numerous innovative theories. He has floated in zero gravity and hopes to fly into space (Biography.com). He is a married man and a father. But most of all, he is a scientist recognized worldwide. He has refuted the image of a scientist as a bookworm delved into calculations and formulas; on the contrary, his personality, humor, books, and participation in different popular projects, such as “The Simpsons” (where he acted as himself) or “Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking,” have shown the world that science can be popular.###"}
{"prompt":"How does the media's portrayal of sex negatively affect children and adults?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" If one had to compose a list of the most popular subjects presented in media, sex would be in the top 10 for sure. The majority of debated moral problems are related to sex; media products, such as song lyrics, video clips on MTV, and many Hollywood movies, are dedicated to sex and\/or intimate relationships. Not to mention that such a condition is limited in terms of cognition and personal development, but it is also rather harmful, as real sex and its commercialized version have stark differences. The danger starts from confusing these two paradigms.\n\nReal sex is necessarily consensual—otherwise, it becomes a crime resulting in legal consequences. Be it passionate or dull, it still remains an act on which both individuals agree. For couples with healthy relationships, sex does not serve as a means to influence a significant other—otherwise, it becomes exploitative. In its turn, sex in media is almost necessarily exploitative, one way or another. The entertainment industry uses sensual images of both genders to promote products; celebrities use sexual images to gain more popularity; filmmakers and writers may overuse sexual scenes to maintain audiences’ interest, and so on. This leads to a binary idea that sex can be either used to achieve goals, or can be purchased in exchange for money or other stimuli (MSRStudies). Adults are believed to be able to distinguish between truth and lies; younger generations, however, often take media images at face value.\n\nChildren and teenagers are the most vulnerable age groups in terms of developing misconceptions about sex under the media’s influence; affected by a constant bombardment of sexual themes, boys and girls tend to get a wrong understanding of gender roles, appropriate behavior and relationships, and of sex itself. Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to completely protect youth from an undesired exposure to commercialized sex themes. Hence, the best way for parents to deal with the possible negative consequences of such exposure would be to build closer relationships with their children, to let them understand that discussing sexual topics with parents is more adequate than learning all that elsewhere (The Oregonian). This could enable parents to fix misconceptions their children might develop under the influence of media.\n\nThe way sex is usually depicted in the media industry has led to its perception from the consumerist point of view. Among the most widespread requirements indirectly imposed by media, one could mention physical attractiveness, sexual appeal and endurance, a certain type of behavior and lifestyle, and an idealistic body image. In pursuit of these rather illusionary ideals, an individual may develop serious psychological or physical issues: stress, depression, anorexia, STDs, and so on (MSFStudies). Stated succinctly, every individual has their own capabilities, and thus should be guided only by their personal experiences, instead of following standardized pre-made models offered by media.\n\nSex has remained a topic of interest. However, the media industry has brought it to a new level, turning it into an idealism that many people try to match. Sex in the media is mostly used for products or for the promotion of celebrities; this is a consumerist approach that implies that sex may be either a mean of achieving goals, or a service that can be easily purchased. Teenagers and children are especially vulnerable to media influences, as they have a lack of personal experience to base their perception on. Affected by distorted images in media, they develop incorrect conceptions about sexuality, gender roles, and sex itself. Moreover, even adults fall into this trap, trying to match idealistic (and often unrealistic) criteria, imposed by media. Inability to meet such requirements can have serious psychological and physical consequences.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the origins of yellow journalism?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In America, the majority of people start their day with a fresh newspaper or with news on TV to stay aware of the main events of the day. Journalism is supposed to be providing American society with unbiased and relevant information. Unfortunately, it is not always this way; there is a category of mass media that does not meet the requirements of true journalism. Such media outlets publish unreliable or half-truthful information, along with subjective opinions of journalists supported by random facts; generally, such a category of mass media is called “yellow journalism.”\n\nYellow journalism as a mass phenomena originated in the 19th century in the United States. Back then, there existed an intense competition between the two most popular newspapers of New York: “New York World,” owned by J. Pulitzer, and “New York Journal,” owned by W.R. Hearst (WiseGEEK). In order to overcome each other and sell more copies, these two periodicals had put sensationalism prior to objectivity; hence, instead of providing their readers with unbiased reports about recent events, these newspapers started to produce scandalous stories that had little or nothing common with reality. Articles were written with the primary goal to sell copies through shock.\n\nToday, one can witness the same process. News reporters seem to be more interested in producing a catching story that would hold public attention, rather than transmitting facts as they are (Western Journalism). Among the most eloquent examples of how yellow journalism works (and how widespread it is) are the headlines of popular newspapers and journals. Almost all of them are composed in such a way that a reader feels intrigued by the promise of “shocking” details disclosed in the article. This motivates readers to read through the text. The most “shouting” headlines are usually printed on the first page, to be instantly seen by a potential audience.\n\nTo be fair, a similar approach is rather often used by serious media resources; since they still need to attract the attention of potential readers to their materials, they can use “shouting” headlines, though in this case, the following articles are usually heavily supported by credible evidence, and are not biased—at least not as much as “yellow” periodicals (JournalismAnatomy).\n\nYellow journalism can be criticized for many flaws: biased information, low credibility, the prevalence of scandal and shock over objectivity, unprofessionalism and discrediting real journalism, and many others. At the same time, “yellow” stories are often more interesting to read compared to serious analytical materials; this is due to the fact that yellow journalism exploits near-scandalous topics and methods of presenting information, and often promises readers a sensation—a momentary event that would amaze (and amuse) a reader, but would be easily forgotten (JournalismAnatomy). Perhaps, this is the reason why yellow periodicals are being read so eagerly.\n\nYellow journalism originated in New York in the 19th century, as a result of severe competition between two major local periodicals of that time: “New York World” and “New York World.” In order to sell more copies, journalists of these periodicals focused on sensation and shock rather than on objective information. This principle remains the fundamental of modern yellow media. They use shouting headlines to draw readers’ attention, and usually present incredible and biased information, supported by several random facts. At the same time, professional serious resources can also use some methods of yellow journalism to sustain their audiences’ interest, though in this case, they still produce high quality materials. Unfortunately, despite its flaws (such as bias, unprofessionalism, and low credibility), yellow media remain popular—mostly due to the exploitation of sensational and amusing topics.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the effects of computer technologies on modern communication?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" I often try to comprehend cultural, social, political, moral, and other changes humanity has undergone throughout centuries of its existence and development. To a large extent, these changes were caused by technological progress: new inventions often transformed the way of people’s lives and respectively, the norms by which societies lived. Airplanes, cars, computers, mobile communication devices, as well as other technological wonders have reformed the way we think and live. But, what is even more curious, technologies have also morphed the way we communicate.\n\nEnglishmen have a tradition to talk about the weather when they meet an unfamiliar (or even a familiar) person. Japanese people have multiple complex ways to start a conversation politely. Many other nations also had their own rules of etiquette; these rules allowed people to enter the communication process smoothly. However, nowadays we can see that etiquette is rather often neglected in favor of the efficiency of communication. The pace of everyday life has increased dramatically compared even to the middle of the 20th century, and today people have to sacrifice courtesy in favor of productiveness and efficiency (IFResearch). Perhaps, from the viewpoint of a person from the 1950s, we would most likely look like rude and straightforward people, as we have become less concerned about our culture of communication, considering it to be archaic.\n\nThe time we live in is interesting in terms of the existence of at least two levels of language usage; basically, they are the real world and virtual reality (IDFS). The Internet has made it possible to transfer not only meaning, but also the emotional palette and even images. All kinds of emoticons in social networks and messengers serve the purpose of mitigating plain, insentient text; moreover, it happens often enough to send a photograph or an image file to explain yourself rather than describe your condition or situation in words (Instagram is a perfect example of how it works). Internet communication has also contributed to the development of a peculiar language layer: netspeak. It is not completely slang—it is rather a new digital language that has evolved from regular English, Spanish, Russian, and other languages. Such neologisms as brb, LOL, u2, btw, cul8r, a\/s\/l, and so on, along with an altered use of grammar rules and other peculiarities form a completely new culture of digital communication. This is not to mention texting (by the way, another specific word) via cell phones and other mobile gadgets.\n\nNot only has the language of the Internet changed, but also the language that we use on a daily basis. The modern English language is regularly updated by the expressions that were unknown less than a decade ago. For example, such neologisms as “to computer-face” means to throw quick disturbed glances at the monitor to create an impression of serious work pressure. The term “like-shock” is used to describe a condition of a person who has posted something in social networks and then gathered an unexpectedly huge amount of “likes” under it. Other peculiar terms such as “ghost-post” or “Facebook-minute” have also appeared in the modern English language due to the influence of computer technologies (Know-What). And though they precisely describe situations and conditions that many modern people are familiar with, their existence seems impossible out of the Internet-communications context.\n\nCommunication today has undergone serious changes, compared even to the middle of the 20th century. The pace of life has increased, and thus lingual etiquette has also evolved. Computer technologies are known to have influenced modern languages most of all. Lots of neologisms such as cul8r or brb appear almost on a daily basis. Besides, not only the language of Internet communication, but also regular language is changing. Many of its terms (such as “to computer-face” or “like-shock”) are familiar to people who often use computers; however, imagining them existing out of the context of the Internet and computer technologies seems impossible.###"}
{"prompt":"How does love chemistry work?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Love has been referred to as a sublime feeling as long as written literature has existed. Poets, philosophers, artists, and other representatives of creative professions sought for its origins, reasons, and recipes. However, in the 21st century, people have become pragmatic enough to assume that love might have more grounded, biological origins. Technological progress has allowed scientists to research this issue and provide valid arguments in favor of the theory that claims love is much (not totally though) about “simple” chemistry.\n\nAccording to Dr. Helen Fisher, an anthropologist at Rutgers University, love as a holistic system can be divided into three basic subsystems, each with its own functional tasks and roles: sex drive, romantic love, and attachment. Sex drive is necessary to make a person start looking for partners; romantic love appears to help a person hold focus on one specific partner; attachment is crucial for building a long-lasting and reliable relationship with a selected partner (Chemistry.com).\n\nEach of these subsystems need a driving force to operate and impact an individual’s behavior. Even though a loving relationship is a lot about psychology, it is still fueled by hormones; this is why using the expression “love chemistry” is fully justified. For the sex drive subsystem, testosterone and estrogen are crucial; the romantic love stage, or attraction, is “driven” mostly by dopamine and serotonin; attachment is sustained by such hormones as oxytocin and vasopressin (BBC Science).\n\nTestosterone and estrogen are respectively male and female sex hormones that are responsible for sex-related physiological reactions, lust, and the motivation to look for a partner. Testosterone and estrogen cause sex drive to be present; however, specialists admit that sex can give a start to romance, as it increases the influx of dopamine to the brain (Chemistry.com). Dopamine and serotonin are hormones that cause euphoria and good mood; the same hormones are also secreted after taking certain drugs, so this is why one can be “high” from the feeling of love, act impulsively, and “get stuck” on the person they fell in love with. In its turn, attachment—as the most long-lasting phase of a love relationship—is driven by the same hormones that are responsible, in particular, for mother-and-child bonds (oxytocin); this hormone is also believed to be secreted when the two partners get intimate. So, a serious relationship is more about care and tenderness, than romance and turbulent feelings.\n\nThe popular expression “love chemistry” should be understood literally. Along with natural psychological processes, love is also, to a significant extent, dependent on the hormones secreted by our bodies during various stages of a relationship’s development. Sex drive, which makes us look for new partners (if we do not have one already), is regulated by the hormones of testosterone and estrogen. During moments of intimacy, the brain is affected by dopamine and serotonin—the hormones that are responsible for all the symptoms of romantic love, such as euphoria, concentration on the object of love, impulsiveness, and so on. As a relationship develops, it becomes reinforced by the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin; oxytocin, in particular, is the same hormone that is responsible for the forming of mother-and-child bonds. Thus, despite the claims that love is purely a solemn and sublime feeling, it also has a lot to do about biology and chemistry.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the situation with the freedom of speech in the United States?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States guarantees every American citizen the freedom of speech, which means a right to freely express one’s thoughts and ideas. The freedom of speech is an integral American value—one of the pillars on which American society was built. However, the right to express one’s thoughts without constraint can be controversial; expressing hatred, for example, is also allowed. The main issue here is to guarantee others’ safety and make sure a person expressing hatred would not go further than expressing his or her position without committing illegal acts. Censorship is meant to regulate such controversies; on the other hand, censorship can be compared to a poisonous gas: it can turn against the attacker if the wind changes (ACLU).\n\nThe first recorded case of censorship in the United States occurred in 1734-1735, when a New York-based newspaper printer John Peter Zenger, who was accused of slandering the governor of New York (Zenger published a seditious libel criticizing the authorities) and was taken into custody. Zenger was defended in court by Andrew Hamilton, who proclaimed in his famous speech “Truth cannot be Libel.” This court case was historic in terms of empowering the freedom of press by the Constitution, even though there were numerous attempts to limit it—such as John Adams’ Alien and Sedition Acts adopted in 1798, or the Sedition Act of 1917 (Censorship in America).\n\nToday, the U.S. media finds itself in an ambivalent situation. It is shielded from revealing their sources, as it is protected by the First Amendment, and Obama’s administration even offered a federal shielding law for journalists. Besides, digital media sources and the Internet are more difficult to control, monitor, and censor. On the other hand, media ownership, combined with financial issues, traditional institutions trying to stay afloat and prevent the appearance of undesired information and political partisanship, as well as the government’s attempt to reveal whistleblowers, negatively affect the freedom of speech (Index on Censorship).\n\nAs for the quality of content being published online and in printed media, censorship is mostly applied to materials that match such criteria as obscenity, provocations, pornography, religiously or culturally sensitive issues, calls for violence, and certain other problematic topics, such as racial discrimination.\n\nAt the same time, it seems censorship is not limited only by these fields. Copyright legislature and surveillance pose one of the biggest threats for a free distribution of information over the Internet. As for surveillance in general, Google Transparency reports testify the United States takes first place in the world for the numbers of requests for users’ personal data; the number of court orders for content removal is also among the highest in the world (after Brazil). Considering that media companies in the United States tend to comply with governmental requests regarding users’ personal data, Americans tend to self-censor their electronic communications to avoid possible legislative issues (Index on Censorship).\n\nThe situation with the freedom of speech in the United States is controversial. Though it is guaranteed by the First Amendment as a right to freely express one’s thoughts and ideas, there are topics that are being monitored and censored, such as pornography, obscenity, religiously and culturally sensitive problems, calls for violence, and several others. American journalists are usually protected by state laws, which guarantee them their ability to work. At the same time, the American government is known to request telecommunication companies for users’ personal data, which results into Americans self-censoring their electronic communications. Copyright legislation is also considered to be a threat to the free distribution of information in media.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the hidden dangers of working in an office?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The majority of urban populations spend at least eight hours per day in an office. In most offices, working conditions do not assume regular physical exercising, or at least moving much; employees have to sit in one place throughout their entire working day. Such conditions can hardly be called healthy or natural, and so they almost necessarily result in manifold health issues, which have become typical among office workers. And whereas some of them such as back pain or bad posture are obvious, other problems may be difficult to identify.\n\nWorking in an office means sharing an environment with a number of other people. This fact means possible issues with germs and bacteria, as all people have different hygienic habits. This especially refers to male office workers; according to a study conducted by microbiologists of San Diego State University and the University of Arizona, men’s office spaces contain on average 10 percent to 20 percent more bacteria than in women’s working environments (MSN). Experts who did not participate in this research still confirmed the results obtained by their colleagues. Michael Schmidt, a microbiologist at the Medical University of South Carolina, says men are usually exposed to a greater risk of getting, for example, a norovirus, as they usually do not pay as strict attention to hand hygiene after using a bathroom as women usually do. Coworkers’ sneezing, coughing, or snuffling can also become a source of germs.\n\nAppliances used in offices can also be dangerous. For example, energy-saving fluorescent light bulbs are claimed to be able to cause skin damage by emitting excessive ultraviolet radiation if located 5 feet or closer to a person, according to the researchers from Stony Brook University in New York (Scientific American). In particular, photodermatoses and skin cancer are among the most often reported diseases. Free candies and coffee, conditioned office air (as well as too cool or overheated air), open office spaces that increases stress because of the lack of privacy, as well as other factors can also be harmful for one’s health (MSN).\n\nThough today it is common knowledge that there are direct psychological and psychosomatic health-related impacts of excessive stress at the workplace, it can be even more dangerous in terms of the safety of surrounding people. In 2007, on average, 16% of workers reported that anger at the workplace had led them to a company’s property damage; 9% of workers reported that violence caused by stress had occurred at their workplace; 10 more percent expressed fear that their environs might not be safe (RJC Associates).\n\nWorking in an office implies exposure to hidden dangers posed by the specifics of the environment. Along with such obvious health issues as poor posture or short sight, there also exist problems that can be noticed only when they manifest themselves. Among such harmful effects one should name germs, ultraviolet radiation from energy-saving light bulbs, conditioned air, and workplace rage caused by excessive stress.###"}
{"prompt":"How have textbooks and laptops changed the way we learn?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The world has become smaller, figuratively speaking, as telephones, cellular phones, and the Internet has invaded most households, leading to swifter ways of learning, progress, and development. Teachers have now been assisted if not replaced by computers instructing students; for example, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) is now running in many academic institutions; electronic books have now replaced physical textbooks; and higher learning institutions have grown nearer to students through online universities.\n\nIn academia, the aid textbooks extend to both teachers and students is indisputable beyond question. Since time immemorial, every subject area was able to get its share among learners through useful textbooks from different publishing houses. Many teachers across the globe could not imagine doing their lessons and teaching their students without any reference (Mckenzie, 1997). A teacher is not a hub of all the concepts there is in a certain subject area. Although not dependent throughout the semester or school year on textbooks, both teachers and students use a subject guide in a textbook, as it provides ample exercises apart from its lessons (Richardson, 2014).\n\nTalking about reliability and credibility, a textbook cannot be out in the market without going through a thorough academic and scholarly process. This means its trustworthiness as a source of lessons is certain. In addition, not all students, especially in rural schools, can afford to replace textbooks with technologies like laptops, etc.\n\nNevertheless, the modifications the technological age brought to ways of learning have posed a big question on the usefulness of textbooks. Affluent students in different schools here and abroad have provided themselves with laptops, if not required by their teachers. With a laptop, a student can listen and encode notes in class, do assignments, share notes, and work with classmates on tasks. Moreover, laptops allows them to view films and documentaries, and download music and video clips. This makes learning more fast-paced and accessible.\n\nBoth these educational resources that provide assistance have their pros and cons. Textbooks are reliable, but they must be updated and\/or replaced through the course of time, as concepts change and new educational progressions arise. Laptops, meanwhile, may be tempting to use as they provide a wide array of informational sources and may come in handy; but one must realize they are expensive, may pose distractions to the learner, and may even provide unreliable information.\n\nEven so, the student can still employ different learning strategies that are defined as steps taken by students to improve their own learning. These specific actions are taken by learners to make learning more convenient, more enjoyable, more self-directed, more effective, and more transferable to new situations.\n\nEach person has his or her own individual way of gathering and processing information. One is also inclined to solve problems in his or her everyday life. These personal cognitive abilities acquired in the course of a long socialization process are called “learning styles” (Reynolds, 1997). Professor Richard Riding (2005) assured students are not all the same. Each learner has individual differences influencing both their learning and their academic achievements.\n\nThe knowledge of one’s learning style can lead to enhanced learning and can help the learner focus on improving weaker points. Learning style analysis is also useful in informing the teaching and learning process, which can be used as a tool to enhance achievement and inclusion (DFES, 2004; Rose & Nicholl, 1997). Because textbooks and laptops are beneficial in a myriad ways, it could be better for any academic institution to integrate their use, and encourage and enlighten students as to their limitations.###"}
{"prompt":"What was the impact of the Reform Judaism movement on Judaism in America?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Students of American Judaism sometimes become shocked by the statements made by scholar Charles Liebman who pointed out the apparent struggle of Jews to integrate into larger American society while maintaining their distinctive group identity (Liebman, Charles). He argued that Jewish authenticity, traditional culture, and society are being challenged by modernity (Liebman, Charles). No doubt his greatest concern was for the American Jewish community. However, his overall treatment of “Jewish identity” is problematic. His essentialist approach assumes the existence of a common underlying Jewish culture, history, set of values, and practices. In the case of the American Jew, he asserts that maintaining one’s Jewish identity is increasingly a matter of personal choice. Despite his pessimism, Liebman presented his “cult of synthesis” theory, which states there is nothing incompatible between being a good Jew and a good American, or stated succinctly, between Jewish and American standards of behavior (Liebman, Charles). Rather, being a good American only reinforced one’s commitment to being an upstanding Jew (Liebman, Charles). After studying several Jewish newspapers of the 20th century and considering theories of several great Jewish culture and history scholars, it may be asserted that ousting Jewish traditions and values entirely was not an acceptable option for acculturation, and that most communities sought ways to find unity between their Jewish and American identities.\n\nA professor of American Jewish history, Arthur Goren, deals with essays about Jewish communal life in America and how the Jew as a minority dealt with what is essentially group survival (Goren, Arthur). There are 10 case studies that examine various strategies for maintaining a collective identity while being active in American social life. Goren’s main question was how to assure Jewish group survival within American freedom. There were certain efforts on the part of Jews not only to maintain Jewish identity, but Americanize it and become integrated in American social, economic, and political life as well (Goren, Arthur).\n\nProfessor Jack Glazier’s book, Dispersing the Ghetto, reveals programs of the Jewish immigrant’s relocation in America during the great wave of immigration of the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Glazier, Jack). He reveals some insightful accounts of the economic, political, and social difficulties that arose due to Jewish immigrants clustering in the urban center. The high density of population made Jewish organizations struggle for relocating them in such a way that they became less concentrated; this refers mostly to the Jews of Lower East Side in New York in the 1880s. In the 20th century, nearly every American city with a considerable Jewish population witnessed this sort of housing segregation. Glazier holds a standpoint that “individuals and ethnic groups to which they belong are the best arbiters of what it worthy of preservation and practice within the framework of American life” (Glazier, Jack).\n\nWhile full rejection of Jewishness in order to completely integrate into American society at large was never an option, Jewish communal leaders constantly sought ways to balance between becoming true American citizens, and maintaining a Jewish belonging. The Reform Judaism movement, which arose in the USA, aimed significant efforts to transform the American Jewish community into an organization accepting to all Jews—less exclusive and less demanding. In his work American Judaism, Nathan Glazer notes the impact of the Reform Judaism movement on Judaism in America. He says that, “By the turn of the century, Reform Judaism was the dominant current of American Jewry and had recreated Jewish identity in congruence with American liberal Protestantism” (Glazer, Nathan). The controversy of the reform of Judaism was indicative of an effort to promote Jewish survival within American freedom.###"}
{"prompt":"How do curfews for teenagers ensure their safety?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The teenage years of an individual is marked by evaluating one’s values, experiencing a shift in outlooks, and a tendency to act rebellious. It can also be a time when someone becomes excessively vulnerable to negative influences, and is magnetized towards dangerous situations. On the other hand, for parents, the period of their children’s adolescence means regularly worrying about their safety and formation as a citizen. Thus, a method of ensuring teenagers’ security is needed, and curfews are often seen as such a measure, since they have proved their efficiency. At the same time, certain peculiarities exist about establishing curfews for children.\n\nThe issue of teenage curfews is widely debated in the United States, where this institution is still rather popular, and in European democracies, where this measure is yet not so widely used. The first and foremost reason for establishing curfews is children’s security. Typical curfews require teenagers under 17 years to stay out of streets starting from 11 p.m. or midnight. This is believed to protect them from crimes committed after nightfall, as well as from violating the law, and there exist serious evidence in favor of this conviction. For example, when New Orleans enabled a dusk-till-dawn curfew in 1994, the rates of juvenile crime were reported to fall more than 20 percent. Even more impressive results were recorded in Dallas, which reported a 30-percent decrease in violent juvenile crime, and a 21-percent decrease in the overall rates of crimes committed by young people (The New York Times).\n\nOn the other hand, curfews can be seen as a preventive measure that infringes on the rights of young people, limiting their freedom. This thesis is particularly supported by the fact that curfew violations and the respective charges are among the most often committed juvenile crimes in the United States. In addition, there were reports claiming that police arrested more non-white teenagers for curfew violations. All this can cause a teenager to believe they have crossed a psychological line dividing them as criminals; thus, such teenagers may start to see themselves as outlaws, which can contribute to committing more serious crimes than a curfew offense (Scribd).\n\nWhat is important for a parent to remember when establishing a curfew for their children is that a teenager’s misjudged perception of certain rules may cause them to act on an anti-scenario, or misbehave in some other way; this is proved by research conducted by the University of Minnesota, according to which teens tend to bristle against what they see as unfair (Global Post). Considering this, parents should avoid the authoritarian style of establishing curfews; instead, they should have a conversation with their teenager that would be aimed at finding optimal conditions for a curfew—that would satisfy both sides. Also, flexible curfews (those which consider teens’ interests) tend to be more effective than rigid agreements.\n\nThe enabling of teenage curfews is among the most debated issues in the United States and in democratic Europe. The first and foremost task of teenage curfews is to ensure teenagers’ security. Cities that have enabled curfews (such as Dallas or New Orleans) report decreases in juvenile crime rates. However, curfew opponents claim this preventive measure infringes on the rights and freedoms of young people; besides, arresting teenagers for curfew violations can propel them to see themselves as outlaws, which can cause them to commit more serious crimes in future. For curfews to be effective, parents should avoid acting as an authoritarian; on the contrary, they should develop and discuss the curfew conditions together with their children in a diplomatic way.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the value of cloud computing?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Beginning from the invention of the centralized server and ending up with revolutionary exploitations of multi-nodal online connections for data management and program processing, the future of computing has evolved out of a network-based model. As businesses actively pursue efficiency and cost reduction throughout their systems and operational framework, the intrinsic value of a flexible, dynamic, and intuitive computing platform has become significant. At the core of such evolving priorities, additional considerations regarding security, integration, and consistency are directly influencing the nature and architecture of the future computing environment. For developers, the introduction of cloud computing not only represented a formal departure from the expensive, bulky, and oftentimes technically-prohibitive servers employed for business management, but it prescribed a robust paradigm shift towards systems architecture that was much more flexible and dynamic. For this reason, the introduction of cloud computing is arguably one of the most significant and influential innovations in computing and networking in the past three decades.\n\nAt the foundation of the cloud computing model, developers have actively pursued a mixture of systems and services which computing specialist Michael Armbrust et al. (2010) describes as an internet-based, comprehensive computing solution. Due to the elimination of the need for separate system architecture and hardware, businesses are now able to utilize the resources of service providers, reorienting the purpose of computing towards goal acquisition and task completion, as opposed to systems manipulation and software management. As this innovative resource continues to expand in diversity, accessibility, and functionality, Armbrust et al. (2010) posit that the resolution of scalar challenges (e.g. software needs, infrastructure demands, hardware consistency) will result in radical new capabilities that are far beyond the scope of the current cloud-based model.\n\nThe value of cloud computing is extensive, especially considering the mobility agenda of the modern generation and the capabilities and expectations associated with new mobile technologies (CCAS, 2014). In critical analysis of the underlying needs associated with the ‘mobile cloud,’ Professor Niroshinie Fernando et al. (2013) reflect on multiple exchange-based scenarios, whereby cloud computing is an essential conduit for resource accessibility, sharing, and interactive applications. With new systems now operating off of distributed infrastructure, the ability to extend internal connectivity across an entire framework of interconnected devices and access ports is quickly revising the concept of mobility in computing operations (Fernando et al., 2013). In fact, the speed of advances in this field is signaling a significant shift away from localized memory and hardware requirements towards computing capabilities that are entirely built upon external architecture (Armbrust et al., 2010).\n\nAlthough much of the vision of cloud computing is based upon mobility and the portability of information resources, Professor Sean Marston et al. (2011) propose that there are explicit business-based opportunities and advantages that must be identified and integrated into this system before widespread adoption can take place. Researchers introduce a variety of contributory and inhibitory measures that will most likely influence the design and purposing of these systems, ranging from regulatory oversights to market-based initiatives (e.g. strategic partnerships between computing firms) (Marston et al., 2011). Ultimately, it is the inability to adequately predict the exact dynamics associated with these diverse, online environments that has led to such diverse, multi-faceted academic analysis in this field.\n\nA broad spectrum of 20th century inventions and advances had a direct influence on the behavior and practices of modern society; however, it was the advent of cloud computing that served to rehabilitate a hardware-based paradigm and introduce the capabilities associated with multi-dimensional, multi-network computing (Queensland Government, 2014). For businesses, the opportunities underlying cloud computing are significant and will substantially reduce inefficiencies and expenses stemming from hardware purchases and upgrades. For society in general, the mobility solutions afforded by cloud computing offer a much more robust platform for interconnectivity, sharing, and productivity. Ultimately, it will be the subsequent century of testing, revision, and adoption that will determine the true value of cloud computing; however, to date, it is evident that this technology is a catalyst for revising the nature and concept of computing in its entirety.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the correlation between psychological conditions and bodily disorders?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Such diseases as anorexia or bulimia are rather well known. Both of them are eating disorders: the first pertains to a person who cannot eat and gradually loses weight; the latter is, on the contrary, a syndrome of an uncontrolled desire to eat. Though these two diseases seem to be contradictory of one another, they have one common aspect: both of them are caused by a person’s mental complexes. Therefore, in this case, we can say the mind affects the body. Moreover, besides anorexia and bulimia, there are many other diseases that are caused by mental factors; researchers claim even cancer can be connected to psychological problems—severe stress, for instance (Cancer Fighting Strategies). Thus, unlike multiple spiritual traditions that try to separate mind and spirit from the body, in fact the mind and the body are connected, and impact each other.\n\nThe correlation between psychological conditions and bodily disorders is called psychosomatics. The term consists of two parts: psyche, which means mind, and soma—body. Whereas any disease has a mental aspect—in terms of how an individual copes with their illness, or as in the examples mentioned in the introduction—the term ‘psychosomatics’ is more often used to describe a physical disease that is thought to be caused, or made worse, by mental factors. For example, among those diseases that are considered to be affected by mental factors are psoriasis, eczema, stomach ulcers, heart disorders, and high blood pressure (Patient.co.uk). Another bright example of psychosomatics is hysterical pregnancy, when a woman feels so anxious about getting pregnant that she develops all the symptoms, even though she is not pregnant.\n\nCertain specialists believe psychosomatics is the key to understanding almost any disease. For example, a famous spiritual teacher, Louise Hay, in one of her books, provides a table containing a list of diseases, their symptoms, and the emotional or psychological reasons standing behind them. Hay claims pneumonia, for instance, is caused by the feeling of despair, and a forbiddance to heal deep emotional wounds; ulcers may develop because of a person feeling consistent fear and believing they are not good enough; Alzheimer’s disease, according to Louise Hay, is caused by a refusal to deal with the world as it is, and anger (Vital Affirmations). A similar approach is shared by many traditional medicine and religious systems; however, there is no scientific proof the mind is able to cause all diseases.\n\nIt is not clear yet why some people suddenly develop psychosomatic diseases, as well as it is not clear how to treat them, especially when it comes to such cases as sudden blindness or severe pain of an unknown nature. There are doctors who specialize in treating psychosomatic disorders; psychologists and psychotherapists can also contribute to treating such illnesses (WiseGeek). On the other hand, to a certain extent, psychosomatics can help a patient to cope with their disease; well known are the astonishing effects of the placebo, which helped to cure even terminal diseases while factually being a simple soother.\n\nThe term psychosomatics displays a link between the condition of an individual’s mind (psyche) and body (soma). Theoretically, a condition of mind can influence one’s physical health—such disorders as anorexia or bulimia speak in favor of this statement. Among other diseases that are considered to be caused or affected by mental factors are eczema, psoriasis, stomach ulcers, heart disorders, and many others. Some specialists—for example, Louise Hay—claim almost all diseases can be caused by the condition of mind or emotions. However, it has not been proved scientifically. Psychosomatics can be treated—both by specialized doctors or regular psychotherapists—but it is yet unclear how to cure such disorders as sudden blindness or severe, unknown pain.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the causes and effects of boredom?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" How many times have you listened to a completely dull university or college lecture? How often do you have to communicate with people who were not interesting to you? Do you have to do something that makes you fall asleep any time you think of it? If yes, then you might think you know everything about boredom, as this is the feeling you experience in the cases similar to those mentioned above. But what if you were told that boredom is not that simple and dull as it seems at the first glance? Boredom is a curious emotion, which can manifest itself in multiple ways, and affects a person either in a constructive way, or can be devastating when completing activities.\n\nThough everybody thinks they know what boredom is, giving a definition of it can be a challenging task. Russian classic writer Leo Tolstoy called boredom “a desire for desires,” which is rather close but not scientific. For a more precise definition, we can refer to the research led by York University professor John Eastwood, who defined boredom as “an aversive state of wanting, but being unable to engage in satisfying activity” (Health24). According to his study, there are three basic components of this feeling, and all of them are related to attention. To feel bored, you must experience difficulties in paying attention to internal (your feelings, thoughts) or external information; if you are aware of your inability to focus, and blame the environment for this—claiming, for instance, that your work is boring, or that a person you talk to is dull—then boredom is guaranteed.\n\nBoredom occurs when you have to perform monotonous or repeated actions; after a while, you usually turn on your inner “auto-pilot,” which frees your mind from contemplation, thinking, and other mental activities. This is why sportsmen, for example, never feel bored while performing their activities—they are consumed by their tasks, focused entirely on what they do every single moment. They do not have a choice; otherwise, they will receive trauma or even die. Or, can you imagine a soldier who would feel bored during gunfire? Or a businessmen who would feel bored while persuading his potential partners to make an agreement with his company?\n\nSurprisingly, boredom can be diverse. Research conducted by Thomas Goetz of the University of Konstanz, and the Thurgau University of Teacher Education in Konstanz, proved that people can feel different types of boredom. In his study, Goetz examined students who often experienced the feeling of boredom; in result, Goetz distinguished five types of boredom: indifferent, calibrating, searching, reactant, and apathetic (National Geographic).\n\nIndifferent boredom is what Goetz also called “a pleasant form” of boredom; the brightest example of it would be relaxing on a couch watching a not very interesting baseball game. Calibrating boredom means having your mind opened to new ideas, but without any motivation to implement them; searching boredom, on the contrary, makes a person highly motivated to find a more exciting activity than the one they are involved in the current moment. Reactant boredom rises within you when you cannot change the circumstances causing it—be it a lecture or a dull task at work. Finally, apathetic boredom, which is characterized by the absence of motivation and new ideas, is rather close to depression, and may have far more negative consequences than other types.\n\nAs for the ways of coping with boredom, it is rather transparent. Finding new interests and hobbies, physical activities, and extreme sports, as well as physical exercise and mindfulness are still considered some of the most effective means of reducing boredom (HowStuffWorks).###"}
{"prompt":"What are the psychological traits of bullies?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" One of the most important periods in an individual’s life is, without doubt, their school years. School is a place where children and teenagers socialize, obtain different social skills, and prepare themselves for their future life and career. School is also a time of turbulent psychological processes, which are typical in one’s teen years; teenagers are especially vulnerable in terms of influence—both positive and negative—on their psyche. In connection to this factor, one should consider the phenomenon typical for many schools around the world, and which can negatively affect a developing individual: school bullying. This problem is so widespread and may cause such severe damage—both psychological and physical—that there already are several preconditions for declaring it a public health issue (Huffington Post).\n\nAccording to data collected by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, about 30% of all children studying in middle and high school were at least once in a semester bullied, or acted as bullies themselves in the U.S. (National Conference of State Legislations). The methods of bullying may differ depending on a social and gender group (thus, boys usually choose more direct forms, such as physical abuse, whereas girls prefer to spread gossip and act in other non-violent ways), but they all have at least one common effect: increasing the social isolation of a victim. At the same time, when asked about the reasons standing behind their inappropriate attitude towards victims, bullies have little or no reasonable explanations.\n\nAt the same time, psychologists have distinguished several psychological traits that are shared by the majority of bullies, regardless of the country they reside in. Bullies most often possess either a manipulative and reserved, or an expressive and active type of personality; they are concerned about their own interests, finding it difficult to see circumstances from the perspective of other people surrounding them; they manifest a desire to gain power over others, and use force, abuse, or manipulation to get what they want from others (Sacramento County Sheriff). At the same time, bullies are considered to feel psychological pain within themselves, probably caused by the shortcomings of their own lives.\n\nHowever, the latter does not excuse the damage dealt to victims. According to recent research, regular headaches, stomachaches, panic attacks and periods of increased anxiety, eating and sleeping disorders, and most disturbing, depression, are among the typical health issues that bullied students experience. However, surprisingly, students who act in an abusive and insulting manner are exposed to these symptoms as well (Huffington Post). In addition, these symptoms usually manifest in clusters: one symptom is often accompanied by several others, which gives psychologists preconditions to refer to these symptoms as a sort of medical syndrome, caused by (or connected to) bullying.\n\nParents who suspect their children have become victims of school bullying are usually recommended to pay closer attention to them. They should encourage children to talk about school life and listen to them carefully; treat children’s complaints seriously, as they may hide much more serious problems; monitor children’s physical (bruises, torn clothes) and psychological (apathy, sadness) conditions. Caring parents should contact school organizations when they suspect their children have been bullied to ensure they are better protected at school. At the same time, it is useful to teach children some self-protection skills, simultaneously ensuring them in the superiority of the peaceful way of resolving conflicts, and in the high value of kindness and an appropriate attitude (Sacramento County Sheriff).###"}
{"prompt":"What are some of the most influential factors that are seen as stressful for adolescents?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Being a teenager is, perhaps, one of the most interesting, intense, and complicated periods in the life of almost any person. In our teen years, our experiences are especially acute and exiting; this age is connected with one’s search of place in the world, of self-identification, and belonging. Teenagers face real world problems more and more often, as well as encounter their first serious challenges and problems: at home, at school, in their relationships. The need to develop new behavioral models and adapt to social norms, and look for one’s place in one’s society can be stressful for a teenager. There are several influential factors that are seen as stressful for adolescents.\n\nOne of the first values teenagers hold dear is their popularity among peers. It is important to notice, though, that popularity in this context should be seen as deeper—as a teenager’s striving for acceptance, for fitting in their peer group. Research shows that if teenagers fail to achieve certain levels of popularity (or believe to have done so), they may feel self-doubt (Livestrong.com). Disappointment in their own appearance, lack of romantic relationships, or social status can become those reasons that evoke stress in a teenager.\n\nThe majority of teenagers in the United States, as well as in the rest of the world, are exposed to another stressful factor, which is studying at high school or at higher level education. According to a survey conducted by the Palo Alto Medical Foundation, academic environment and its concerns can be pressing for a teenager (Global Post). This group of stress factors includes teenagers’ fears about their future life and career (often boosted or inspired by parents); trying to receive good grades or to achieve self-realization among classmates; large amounts of homework; a necessity to prepare for exams, and so on. Multiplied by teenage maximalism and perfectionism, academic concerns become a powerful stress provocateur.\n\nYet another group of factors that can cause stress and depression among adolescents is relationships. This group includes the personal relationships of a teenager with their parents, peers, and the opposite sex. According to statistics, 56% of stressful situations in teenagers’ lives are connected to parents, 52% with friends, and 48% of stressors were connected to romantic relationships (Teen Help). It is not surprising so many stressors are connected to the sphere of personal relationships considering that in teenage years individuals learn to act, interact, and react within a society, and develop new behavioral models.\n\nAdolescence is an age that makes individuals encounter various social and personal challenges; respectively, this period is associated with an increased number of potentially-stressful factors. Among the most influential of them one can name teenagers’ striving for acceptance and popularity; academic concerns and environment; and personal relationships, which include contact with parents, friends, and romance.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the qualities that you admire in your best friend?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" According to my observations, when people are being asked about persons they admire, they usually name famous figures. Though it is understandable that people choose respected people in a given society or discipline, we tend to forget about the fact that outstanding people worth admiring are everywhere around us. To break out of the trend of laying laurels on celebrities, I would like to talk about my best friend, whom I admire.\n\nHis name is David, and he comes from a family of Georgian refugees who escaped the country when a civil war broke out there in 1991. He was a small child back then, but he says he can remember tanks driving through the main streets of his hometown. For a couple of years, David’s family resided in Eastern Europe, and then managed to move across the Atlantic Ocean and settle in the United States, in New York, where I met him while studying in high school.\n\nPerhaps his most protuberant quality is his erudition, formed by his passion for studying. I do not know any other person—at least among people I am surrounded with—who has such a diverse knowledge in varying fields. David would be reading literature on history, physics, political science, economy, and cultural studies just because he was interested in it, not because it was an assignment given to him by his university professors. A couple of years ago, he became extremely interested in Arabian culture, and this interest resulted in deep research in this field. He studied the history of the Middle East from Sumer and Babylon and to the modern days, and in my opinion, he now can be considered a specialist in this subject. At present, he works with Middle East diplomatic delegations, participates in conferences, and I am sure this is work he enjoys.\n\nDavid has a natural inclination for studying foreign languages. I do not know how he studied English; he speaks it fluently and almost without an accent. Besides Georgian and English, David also speaks Arabic, Spanish, Russian, and Hebrew. His language skills allow David to make friends and maintain a correspondence with numerous people around the world—they are extremely valuable to his work. It was his goal to become a polyglot, and he reached it by his own efforts: all the foreign languages he knows, he has studied himself. This speaks in favor of such qualities as discipline, persistence, and a sense of purpose.\n\nDavid is a person who can be called selfless. Though I do not know whether it is for good or bad for him, David will consistently try to help his friends, relatives, and acquaintances (and often even unfamiliar people), even if it ruins his own plans. Combined with David’s sense of responsibility, this makes him a reliable person who can be counted on. However, this trait of his is so prominent that many unscrupulous individuals—be it colleagues or relatives—use David’s capabilities for their own goals, addressing him for help much more often than it is proper and using his inability to refuse requests.\n\nMy best friend David is not a publicly-recognized person. He is not a celebrity, he has not made significant scientific discoveries, written a book, or influenced the life of a country. If you see him in the streets, you will probably never guess that you see a man of great intelligence, willpower, and dignity, and will simply pass him by. But if you knew David as well as I do, you would admire his personality as well. We are no longer students, and our lives now intersect more rarely than we would both want. But I think this is a friendship that will never grow dim.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the origins of Halloween?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Like Christmas, New Year’s Day, Ramadan, or Yom Kippur, Halloween is celebrated almost in every country, even if the celebration implies only external attributes, such as pumpkins, costumes, and children asking for candy. Though the initial meaning of Halloween had much to do with occult powers, spirits, and protection against evil forces, today it is more of a merry holiday, a little bit spooky, but still enjoyed both by adults and children. So, what are the origins of Halloween?\n\nHistorically, the word Halloween is a contraction of the phrase “All Hallows Even,” which meant the day before All Hallows Day (more known as All Saints’ Day) (About.com). It was a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned into a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the western world on October 31.\n\nThough it is considered that Halloween has its origins in the early Middle Ages, some scientists think it is even more ancient. Peter Tokofsky, an assistant professor in the department of folklore and mythology of UCLA, believes Halloween as we know it today arose from the Celtic festival Samhain (Albany.edu). Samhain was demarcating the end of summer; on this day, souls of the dead were believed to be penetrating the real world. This was also the Celtic New Year, and druids used to celebrate it with a great fire festival, to ‘support’ the dimming Sun and not to let it vanish.\n\nIt was believed during Samhain that the living were entertaining the dead; on that night, spirits were looking for a body to possess for the entire incoming year. To avoid such a destiny, people would dress up like evil spirits themselves; scary masks or masks of animals were used to mimic these spirits and deceive them, thus avoiding being possessed. Most likely, this rite has given the start to the modern tradition to wear costumes of ghosts and witches on Halloween.\n\nLater, Samhain was influenced by Roman and Christian cultures after Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honor all saints and martyrs (History.com). Halloween gradually started to gain its modern features and characteristics. Though Halloween today is seen more as an American holiday, it was transported to North America by Irish immigrants in the middle 1800s (About.com). There it became, to a significant extent, commercialized and popularized, and its religious background has been almost forgotten; at the same time, back on the lands where Samhain originated, even in 19th century, people were afraid to walk outside after nightfall.\n\nAlong with Christmas, the New Year’s Day, and other grand holidays, Halloween is one of the most ancient and mysterious festivals, which has its origins in long forgotten pagan beliefs and rituals. As it happened to the majority of these holidays, Halloween’s religious connotations are today known by few; nowadays, it is celebrated more for fun. But, despite this, an attentive and curious researcher will easily trace the spirit of hoary rites and customs in modern trick-or-treating, cosplay, and symbols.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the advantages and disadvantages of office relationships?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is not a secret that most of the population in developed countries work in the sphere of intellectual labor, which almost always means working in offices. The corporate culture of capitalistic societies implies that at least half of the office worker’s day is spent at the workplace; and since working with other people inevitably requires communication and interaction, relationships between coworkers establish almost out of necessity. In this case, we are talking about workplace relationships, which can be divided into romantic, friendly, and competitive categories.\n\nAccording to Forbes, 59% of American office workers have at least once in their lifetimes dated a colleague; this means that workplace romance is an incredibly widespread phenomenon (Forbes). For example, the U.S. President Barack Obama met his current wife while working at a Chicago law firm in 1989; Michele Obama used to be his supervisor back then. Among other famous people who found their counterparts at the workplace, one can mention Bill and Melinda Gates, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Rupert Murdoch and Wendi Deng. And though, according to statistics, office romances often end up with marriage and a happy end, such relationships can have adverse outcomes as well. According to the research conducted by Charles A. Pierce, an associate professor of management in the Fogelman College of Business and Economics at the University of Memphis, office relationships can lead to sexual harassment; his research states that since 1980, there has been more than 50 federal and state workplace romance-sexual harassment legal cases (Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology).\n\nAnother type of office relationship is friendship. Usually, you can choose your friends, but cannot choose colleagues. Fortunately, you also have an option to make friends with colleagues. Making friends with the right group of people can boost one’s career; it can also make a person feel more comfortable at the workplace. On the other hand, office friendships can burn out quickly; a change in a workplace, even within one office, can negatively affect a friendly relationship. Among other factors that affect office friendship are changes in department or position (Monster). This can especially refer to cases if a person takes an executive position and thus has to monitor and organize the work of their friends.\n\nWorkplace competition is another natural type of office relationship. Competition can be created by an employee’s desire to overcome his or her colleagues in terms of quality and quantity of work done. At the same time, along with high productivity, increased levels of stress and developing a defensive line of behavior can also be the results of workplace competition (Chron). Stress is caused by a need not only to perform one’s daily duties, but to perform better than colleagues; a person in a competitive environment often worries about being compared with others, especially by supervisors, and thus has to be ready to explain and defend their results of work.\n\nOffice work today assumes developing not only business, but also personal relationships. The most common type of such relationships are romance, friendship, and competition. Each type can have its own advantages or disadvantages. For example, an office romance can end up both with marriage or sexual harassment; friendship can help workers better overcome obstacles and decrease stress, but can burn out easily. Finally, office competition can increase productivity, but leads to increased stress and to the development of defensive behavior.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the dangers of sleep deprivation?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The human body is a mechanism that is perfectly designed. A healthy, properly functioning body is a self-sufficient unit able to effectively deal with all kinds of daily challenges. Our bodies do not require conscious control—many processes, such as digestion, breathing, heartbeat, and so on are automatic. All our bodies requires from us is careful and proper handling; alas, this is where many problems start. Except the obvious misuses, such as consuming fast food, physical inactivity, or bad ecology, there are hidden dangers which we usually do not pay attention to. One of the most dangerous (and the most typical nowadays) among them is the lack of sleep.\n\nToday, it has become almost natural to sleep less. We often believe there is nothing wrong in sacrificing a couple of hours of sleep in favor of other activities, while jobs and other social responsibilities consume plenty of time as well. Besides, many people suffer from various kinds of sleep deprivations, caused by psychological or other reasons. Unfortunately, a lack of sleep is not so harmless. Recent studies proved it significantly increases chances of heart disease; research conducted in 2011 proved people who sleep less than six hours per night are more likely to develop heart disease or die from it (ABC News). Besides this problem, people who sleep less are more prone to high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, stroke, and diabetes. On the contrary, people who practice healthy nutrition, moderate physical exercises, and sleep seven or more hours per night, lower their risks of getting heart disease by up to 65%.\n\nA lack of sleep can be a reason for accidents as well. For example, one needs to look no further than at the famous disasters in modern history: the 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island, the massive Exxon Valdez oil spill, or the 1986 nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl; this is not to mention car accidents, airplane crashes, and other catastrophes. According to the American National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the annual amount of car crashes caused by fatigue equals 100,000 (WebMD). Poor sleep also has a negative influence on job performance and safety—workers who have sleep deprivation are more prone to work accidents, and have more sick days per accident.\n\nPerhaps one of the most bizarre effects of total sleep deprivation is its influence on food consumption. According to a study conducted by the journal Obesity, sleep deprivation can decrease higher level thinking and increase the feeling of hunger instead (Medical News Today). The results of the study showed that men tended to buy 18% more food, and consume 9% more calories when they were sleep deprived, compared to those nights when they had sound sleep. In addition, the same study showed that the concentration of the hunger-increasing hormone ghlerin in male bodies increases after a night of poor sleep. Therefore, there may exist a correlation between obesity and the lack of sleep.\n\nIn the modern, fast-paced world, the lack of sleep has become almost a norm. However, its negative effects are being strongly underestimated. Among the most common malfunctions caused by sleep deprivations one can name severe heart problems, low concentration, and increased risks of getting into accidents, and its indirect contribution to the development of obesity.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of organic food?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It is a common fact that the human population on Earth is enormous: over 7 billion people inhabiting a relatively small planet. Aside from many other conundrums stemming from overpopulation stands a question of food supplies. Those who reside in agricultural regions with a low density of population have a possibility to eat natural products that they grow on their own, or which at least contain little or no artificial nutrients. However, the situation is different in the industrial and developed regions, where food is often produced with the use of various kinds of preservatives, chemicals, nutrients, and other external ingredients, which can cause harm to the body. Organic food can be seen as a better alternative, since it is more natural.\n\nOrganic foods are believed to be safer than conventional ones, and it has natural origins, which makes it a reasonable choice. According to the requirements of the British Soil Association, organic food should consist of at least 95% natural ingredients (Soil Association). “Natural” means the ingredients should come from the plants and animals grown or bred without any chemicals or artificial nutrients. In the United States, there also exists strict requirements for the products labeled as organic: the U.S. Department of Agriculture has enabled a special certification program that requires organic food to meet specific standards.\n\nIn correlation to this, customers should pay attention to the labeling on the packaging of food products. If it says 100% organic, this means the product has been manufactured without the use of any chemicals or artificial additives; simply organic means the product consists of 95% natural ingredients (MayoClinic). Returning to the standards of organic nutrition, organic food cannot contain, in particular, such ingredients as synthetic fertilizers or pesticides; genetically engineered organisms; raw manures cannot be used to fertilize fields as well, because of its potential contamination (Canadian Living). The other 5% of ingredients are allowed as they are not available in organic form, and for non-food ingredients (such as salt, water, and a restricted number of additives like iron or thiamine).\n\nOrganic food is known to be healthier than conventional food. According to recent research in the United States, organic food contains an average of 63% more calcium, 73% more iron, 125% more potassium, and 60% more zinc compared to conventional food products. This is not to mention the fact that common food is about 25% more toxic than the food produced from natural components (Canadian Living). Besides, many people claim it tastes better than other products.\n\nOrganic products—not only food, but also textiles and cosmetics—are becoming more popular among people globally. Though the price of organic products is often higher than regular ones, its safety, healthiness, and natural origins fully compensate for this disadvantage.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the three disciplines you would most like to study in school and why?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" When I was a child and attended elementary school, I often dreamed that students could ignore those boring disciplines they had to attend to, and could choose subjects of interest to them. I can remember how passionate I was about gathering all the information I could about dinosaurs; I imagined that one beautiful day, our teacher, Mrs. Morris, would enter the classroom and announce: “Alright children, from now on, we are going to study paleontology.” Unfortunately, none of my classmates knew this word back then, so when I shared my dream, they would shrug their shoulders. Today, as I am studying in high school, I still have similar dreams sometimes.\n\nWhat I would like to study most of all during this academic year would be astronomy. I am not talking about such complex branches as astrophysics; what I mean is a more common knowledge about the universe and processes which take place in the surrounding space. Black holes, supernovas, galaxies’ collisions, unknown distant stars, possibly inhabited planets, solar wind, enormous gas nebulae—we cannot imagine how many mysterious phenomena exist in the universe. Attending astronomy classes in high school would be a great opportunity to lift the veil of mystery and glance at the other side of everyday reality.\n\nAnother discipline that I would like to study is ancient history. There is a saying that everything we think is new has already been invented. I agree with this thesis. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Democritus suggested the theory of atoms, according to which everything in the world consisted of the smallest invisible undivided parts. Ancient history is a chance to find out more about the origins of the knowledge that we use today, as well as to trace the historical path of countries and nations and understand modern geopolitical processes better.\n\nAlthough it may seem strange, I would also like to see such a discipline that would help students understand the technical aspects of technologies they are using on a daily basis. Many people today drive cars, use mobile phones, or buy domestic appliances, but for an average consumer, technology is almost similar to magic: they know it works, but they have no idea how. Therefore, I would like to learn some basics of engineering to be more familiar with the appliances that surround me—to be able, if needed, to fix my car (when I have one), older computer boards, or do any other similar work myself.\n\nBeing able to choose to study disciplines of interest at school was my dream since childhood. If I had a chance this academic year, I would choose to study astronomy, ancient history, and the basics of engineering. While astronomy is more about mystery and romanticism for me, ancient history and engineering basics are those disciplines that can be of practical use.###"}
{"prompt":"What are you looking forward to in English 101?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" First, I will define learning in the best way I can through my own understanding. Learning is gaining new mental structures within our mind that we can come back to at will to access it as information. In terms of this definition, I would like to learn writing styles and techniques from the examples of the books we are going to read in this class. I am particularly keen on Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, as I have heard much about his way of storytelling and the poignant moods he conveys in rather simple language. Learning by example from the masters of literature is better than reading textbooks, in my opinion. The writing styles I want to learn about is realism and modernism, and the writing techniques I yearn to enhance my knowledge in is showing and writing without apparent sentiment.\n\nSince I learned a great deal about writing essays in English 100 and English 99, I see no real need to improve in this respect at this point. I learned how to fashion a thesis statement, how to organize paragraphs and their ideas, plus how to write a reasonable conclusion. What I want to concentrate on now is how to upgrade my writing styles and techniques, so that I can become a more well-rounded writer.\n\nI have studied writing and English literature on my own outside of school, as I want to be a writer. I see no other profession for myself, as all other subjects are rather drear to me. Studying writing and the English language seem to be the only subjects that contain creativity in their curriculum—at least at this stage in my academic career.\n\nSome students may write that they want to meet new friends in class, but I am fine with my own friends within school and outside of that realm. What I am truly looking forward to in this class is improving my knowledge in writing, and not to be engaged more socially. I will, however, participate in discussions and group projects, as it only wise to do so in a collective environment and in respect of my grades.\n\nI plan to take copious notes on books we read and use my findings in my essays accordingly. This to me is not extra work, as I will thoroughly enjoy it and see it as a part of my training to become a professional writer. As I said, I am vying for a career in writing, so I do not have a chance to act with lethargy at a chance to garner more knowledge in my respective field.\n\nI look forward to attending English 101, with its examinations of writing techniques and styles, illustrated by classic literature. I am certain this course will add a reservoir of information to my mind, and will stand as a base for my further studies in my forte.###"}
{"prompt":"How have antibiotics revolutionized medicine?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Among scientific discoveries made throughout humankind’s history, some are well-known and instantly come to mind when one is asked to name the most important scientific discoveries of all time, while others can be easily overlooked, regardless of the tremendous impact they may have had on the world. Antibiotics can be named as an example of one of such discoveries; though they have revolutionized today’s medicine, they are not the first to come to one’s mind when talking about science.\n\nAntibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria, viruses, and so on. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were much higher than today. For instance, the streptococcus pyogenes bacteria had caused about half of all post-birth deaths (Cleary); staphylococcus aureus was fatal in 80% of the cases. Tuberculosis and pneumonia bacteria were famous killers as well. Today, the discovery of antibiotics has enabled medicine to treat these communicable diseases (Tulkens) together with other diseases that were once considered terminal.\n\nAntibiotics can be bacteriostatic (those that prevent bacteria from multiplying) (Dodd) or bactericidal—those that exterminate the bacteria. They penetrate a bacterial cell surface, causing changes in their mode of reproduction (Tulkens). Antibiotics can be prescribed to patients in various forms, such as topical application, orally, parentally, or as injections. Antibiotics are usually manufactured in two ways. One of them is natural and is known as biosynthesis; the other one is synthetic. Among the most commonly used antibiotics, one can name Penicillin, Cephalosporin’s, Aminoglycosides, Tetracycline’s, and Polypeptides Bacitracin.\n\nDespite all their efficiency and advantages, antibiotics are often called a necessary evil. The truth is that drugs have the potential to be both beneficial and harmful for human health. Antibiotics are able to kill sensitive bacteria necessary for the normal functioning of one’s body; for example, the use of antibiotics negatively affects bacteria that live in intestines, thus causing dysbiosis. Besides, antibiotics do not always kill all harmful bacteria, allowing resistant ones to survive; this creates problems for the future treatment of similar diseases (Prober). Antibiotics often cause allergic reactions, such as rashes, severe anemia, stomach disorders, deafness, and many others.\n\nAntibiotics are a beneficial discovery of the human genius. They help to cure diseases that had once been considered terminal, and are easily available in the modern world. At the same time, antibiotics are often treated as a necessary evil due to their negative side effects and the potential harm they can inflict on the human body.###"}
{"prompt":"How are pumps used in various aspects of life, such as medicine, engineering, and home improvement?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Pumps and pumping systems are vital devices in the maintenance of the majority of modern civilizations. According to Karl Ochsner (2008), a specialist in pumping technologies, pumps are devices that move liquids and gases, and sometimes slurries by a mechanical action. Engineers classify pumps into three categories based on the method they use to move fluids. These categories are direct lift, gravity pumps, and displacement pumps. People use pumps in various aspects of life, such as medicine, engineering, and home improvement. Pumps can be operated through many energy sources including electricity, wind power, engines, and manual operations. Without pumping systems, all the aforementioned technologies would not be able to operate.\n\nPumping systems are widely employed in the medical field. Doctors use infusion pumps to administer fluids, nutrients, and medications into a patient’s circulatory system (Ochsner, 2008). These infusions are intravenous, but sometimes doctors use subcutaneous, epidural, and arterial methods. These pumps can infuse fluids more accurately than nurses can perform it manually. For example, nursing staff can administer as little as 0.1 milliliters injections per hour, injections with retaliate boluses if the patient requests, hourly injections, or injections per minute (Chapleau & Pons, 2007). Doctors also inject controlled amounts of fluids beneath the skin; sine infusion pumps can produce high but controlled pressures.\n\nThe domestic use of pumping systems includes pumping water, waste pumping, cleaning, and hot showers. Pumps located at common points in housing units make water supply to homes possible. These pumps are electrically operated to pump water to connected houses. Water from the source is pumped to the treatment plant. Treated water is then piped to various houses using pumps (Henn & Soule, 2010). Pumps ensure people have access to clean water. Waste effluents are removed from homes with the use of progressing cavity pumps. Sewerage systems are connected with pipes; waste water from homes is connected to a central waste treatment point. Sewerage materials are treated and pumped to recycling units (Henn & Soule, 2010). After treatment, the remaining waste is pumped to disposal areas to ensure the environment is maintained clean and fit for human beings. Gases used for cooking are piped using pumps to cooking systems. Pumps are also used for cleaning floors and walls, and heating shower water.\n\nPumps are administered in engineering fields such as manufacturing and construction operations. Compressed air powered pumps are intrinsically designed to ensure safety in manufacturing operations. Some manufacturers offer ATEX-certified models in order to comply with engineering regulations. Wilden pumps, Sandiper, and ARO are relatively inexpensive pumps and perform most of the engineering duties, such as pumping water out of bunds and pumping hydrochloric acid from secure storage (Henn & Soule, 2010). The pumps can either be manufactured as elastomers or body construction. Pumps reduce the effort required to perform various operations and make manufacturing and construction activities effective.\n\nPumps are devices used to move fluids, gases, and slurries; they are crucial in the maintenance of the modern lifestyle. Pumps are applicable in the medical field, domestic applications and engineering operations. Doctors use infusion pumps to infuse nutrients and medication into patients’ bloodstreams. Domestic uses of pumps include moving piped water and sewage transfers. The main engineering uses of pumps include constructions and manufacturing functions. As it can be seen, pumps are an intrinsic part of modern life.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the most common problems female bodybuilders face regularly?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Muscular women cannot be considered a new phenomenon. Ancient myths tell us about the Amazons—female warriors who inhabited the wilderness and who used to kill every male child born in their community. They were known as perfect fighters and archers; in order to be capable of competing with men in warfare and physical strength, Amazons possessed strong and trained bodies. In reality, however, one could hardly run into a muscular woman, at least until the beginning of the 19th century, when big, strong women demonstrating wonders of physical strength could be seen almost in any circus (Muscle Insider). Still, muscular women remained an exotic rarity.\n\nAs time passed, the situation began to change significantly. Bodybuilding had remained exclusively a male sport until the year 1977, when Henry McGhee, an employee of the Downtown Canton YMCA, introduced his idea that women should share the opportunity to display their physical abilities the way men had done for years. He had created the United States Women’s Bodybuilding Association, and though it did not last long, women across the country took notice (Muscle Insider). In 1980, Rachel McLish won the first Ms. Olympia contest, and can be considered the start to the spreading of female bodybuilding around the world.\n\nToday, you still can walk down the street without running even into a single female bodybuilder, though the phenomenon of feminine physique has gained a significant popularity. Bodybuilding is a way for certain women to express themselves and, perhaps, demonstrate and assure their equality with men in terms of physical capabilities. Unfortunately, loads taken on that are naturally not typical for the female human body can result in severe health problems.\n\nAmong the most common problems female bodybuilders face regularly is amenorrhea, which is an absence of menstrual periods. This happens due to intense exercises and low body fat levels, or exercise-related hormones. Also, female bodybuilders have developed a new kind of eating disorder, usually called EDBT (eating disorder, bodybuilder type). This disorder is characterized by high-protein, high calorie, and low-fat diets, which are consumed in certain periods and sequences during the day. The disorder appears in a women’s fear to eat food if the precise caloric intake of meals is unknown. Besides, the wide use of steroids, without which none can gain such impressive muscular mass as bodybuilders usually do, increases the levels of testosterone in their bodies. As a result, a woman’s voice tone lowers, facial hair appears, their figure becomes more masculine, and the jaw becomes squared. In addition, a woman starts to experience male pattern baldness and changes in their reproductive system, and her breasts decrease in size (LiveStrong).\n\nThough today no one prohibits women from doing bodybuilding, this type of physical activity causes severe physiological and aesthetic changes in the human female body. A woman starts to look more like a man, and experiences serious problems, mostly concerning the reproductive system. Also, some female bodybuilders experience an eating disorder that bars them from eating when the precise caloric intake of a meal is unknown. It is difficult to tell whether bodybuilding is or is not an occupation for women, but it definitely affects their appearance as being attractive to the opposite sex and affects their bodies in adverse ways.###"}
{"prompt":"How did Coco Chanel's upbringing shape her future as a fashion designer?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Coco Chanel was the only fashion designer to be named among the “100 most influential people of the 20th century” by Time magazine. She revolutionized the face of fashion in a way no one ever dared. Her little black dress aka LBD and Chanel No. 5 perfume are some of the iconic products she created. She was known to disguise her personal life with lies, which only made her more intriguing. There are more than a few biographies of her, with different set of facts, which is understandable. She loved being a mystery. She believed fabricated words are better than her stale past. Coco Chanel can be fairly called an outstanding woman and one of the most significant mysteries of the fashion industry.\n\nGabrielle Bonheur Chanel was born in 1883 in Saumur, France. Her mother, Eugénie Jeanne Devolle, passed away when Chanel was twelve years old. Her father, Albert Chanel, lived a nomadic life. He sent Chanel, along with her two sisters, to an orphanage. She lived there until she was eighteen years old and then shifted to a boarding school, where she learned the trade of a seamstress. She later joined a small tailoring store. When she was not sewing, she was singing at a café. She was one of the performers who would entertain the crowd before the stars’ arrival. That is where she got the name Coco, because of the songs she sang. Her failed attempt at being a singer brought her back to the old tailoring job.\n\nSocialite Étienne Balsan was Chanel’s way into high society. She was his mistress for three years, where he treated her to the perks of rich life. Chanel started designing hats, out of boredom at first. They started attracting attention, which made it her first commercial enterprise. In 1910, she opened a hat store named Chanel Modes, which became a success. After this endeavor, she left Balsan for Captain Arthur Edward Capel. He took her to Paris. He helped her open a store in 1913 named Deauville. He is known to have had a great influence on her life. Their affair went on for nine years, even though he was not faithful to her. He was killed in an accident, which Chanel called the single most devastating event of her life.\n\nDeauville’s success ignited Chanel’s confidence. She opened another store named Biarritz, which was so prosperous that Chanel was able to return her original investment from Capel within a year. In 1918, Chanel was able to rent a whole building in one of Paris’ fashionable streets. By the end of 1919, Chanel established herself as a registered couturier. In 1932, Chanel reached California to fulfill an agreement she made with film producer Samuel Goldwyn to design for MGM stars. Chanel did not like the ways of Hollywood. She found them to be infantile and vulgar. She continued designing costumes for French films, though. Chanel attracted controversies with her unorthodox ways and her affairs with men of high stature. The biggest controversy was her working as a Nazi agent during World War II (Telegraph, 2011). All through the war, she resided at The Ritz. She was known to have an affair with a German officer. In 1971, Chanel passed away doing what she loved doing, preparing the spring catalog.\n\nChanel, with her quirky traits and impeccable fashion sense, became a brand herself. She liberated women from the stiff corseted look of the time. She rebelled against her poverty, her limited opportunities and the way French society looked at women. Not having a Chanel dress made you a fashion blunder. That is the level of her authenticity. The Chanel suit, the Chanel bag, her pearl jewelry are still all the rage. Her life is an inspiration to many. Chanel’s life was depicted through all channels of art (Loco Over, n.d). People continue to try to unveil who she was and what she wanted to be.###"}
{"prompt":"What are some popular conspiracy theories?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The recent scandal around Edward Snowden, a former employee of the National Security Agency of the United States of America, and his exposure of the U.S. government’s national and international surveillance of the public has increased an interest in conspiracy theories. Though these theories have been around for decades, Snowden’s compromising made the public take a look at them from a different perspective. Theories about global shadowing, lustration, and total control were considered myths, but now enthusiasts are revising the most popular conspiracy theories and guessing whether they are true as well. Among the most popular conspiracy theories are those about the origin of the AIDS virus, Pearl Harbor, and the CIA’s implication in drug distribution.\n\nOne of the most popular conspiracy theories is that AIDS, this scourge of third-world countries, was artificially created in a laboratory. This version of the virus’ origin was introduced by Dr. William Campbell Douglass, who had claimed that HIV, which causes AIDS, was designed in 1974 in the laboratories of the World Health Organization (Telegraph). He believed it was created for experiments in Africa and other third-world countries, supposedly as an attempt to control overpopulation. Other researchers have claimed AIDS was created by the CIA or the KGB with the same purpose.\n\nAnother popular conspiracy theory refers to the Pearl Harbor tragedy. Theorists believe the Japanese forces were provoked to attack Pearl Harbor by President Franklin Roosevelt, who knew about the planned assault but failed to warn his fleet commanders (Telegraph). He is believed to be warned by the governments of Britain, the Netherlands, Australia, Peru, Korea, and the Soviet Union; theorists assume Roosevelt needed the Pearl Harbor base to be attacked to provoke Hitler into declaring war on the U.S. The American public and Congress were against the U.S. entering the war in Europe, so Roosevelt needed a strong argument to force them. Theorists also claim the U.S. military had broken all Japanese codes to intercept messages about the attack, but still did nothing to prevent the tragedy.\n\nThe CIA is perhaps one of the most controversial agencies in the world, and the number of conspiracy theories referring to it is astronomical. One of the popular theories is that the CIA is connected to drug distribution. Specifically, in the mid-1990s, the reporter Gary Webb more-or-less accused the CIA of having connections with drug dealers from Nicaragua, who were believed to be operating in the United States (Listverse). Webb was hounded to suicide by the media, and the scandal was smothered up. And though Webb’s accusations were not direct and concrete, there still exists many other theories about the CIA’s involvement in this nefarious business.\n\nAs it turned out recently with the unveiling of the mass surveillance program of U.S. intelligence agencies, conspiracy theories are not always fairy tales for alert and receptive citizens. Perhaps, other popular theories will appear to be true as well. If theories about the artificial origins of AIDS, the Pearl Harbor attack, and the CIA’s involvement into criminal activities will find increased evidence, new scandals and public outrage are guaranteed.###"}
{"prompt":"How can people effectively reduce their risk of obesity?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Obesity among adults and teenagers is considered to be one of the most common and disturbing problems globally, at least in economically-prosperous countries. Though food manufacturers notify customers about the nutritional value and the amounts of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates contained in most products, this does not contribute to decreasing the scope of the obesity issue. Nutritionists say that the origins of the problem lay not only in what people eat, but in how they eat. Consequently, it is essential to have knowledge about the most common eating habits and offer alternatives to each of them.\n\nThe general population’s consensus in developed countries is that if they consume larger portions or high-calorie food, they will feel full longer; accordingly, during their lunch breaks, they eat as much as they can, and then return to their offices. While those who have active professions, such as construction workers or woodsmen, burn calories faster and thus are less exposed to obesity, many office workers can be categorized as being connected to risk, as they sit down at a desk for many hours after eating. Eating at night is even worse, as a person does not simply lie in bed, but processes in their body, including food digestion, slows down. An effective alternative is to eat more often, but in smaller portions, and to chew food thoroughly—in this case, satiety will occur sooner, and last longer, than if you were swallowing big bites.\n\nOpposed to popular opinion, fats are useful and beneficial for the human body. At the same time, this does not mean you can eat all fatty food without limitation. Trans fats and saturated fats, taken excessively, increases the risk of heart disease and obesity, because one gram of fat has about twice as many calories per gram as carbohydrates and proteins (Web MD). On the other hand, a healthy diet should include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Monounsaturated fats are contained in such products as oil, peanut oil, and olive oil, as well as avocados, nuts, and seeds. Polyunsaturated fats, including Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, can be found in fatty fish such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, and sardines (Helpguide). One should also try different types of protein, simultaneously moving away from making it the center of your daily meals.\n\nMany people who try to lose weight make excessive efforts involving personal will power, forbidding themselves from products that they want. When you recognize certain foods as prohibited, your body will start to want more of it. In this case, if you fall into temptation, you will most likely experience a strong feeling of guilt or failure. In most cases, reducing portions of “banned” products and eating them rarely rather than usually is a more effective measure: you do not feel like you have to sacrifice your favorite food in favor of healthy nutrition. And as time goes on, you will discover that your craving for such food decreases.\n\nThough many people share the myth that healthy nutrition means counting calories and panicking about every sip of beer or chocolate, it is not true. The secret is not what people eat, but how they eat. Most often what they need is not a diet, but a revision of their eating habits. This includes split meals in smaller portions, a more balanced combination of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, and reducing, not giving up, food which is favored but not exactly healthy.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the most common withdrawal symptoms of heroine addiction?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Among prohibited narcotic substances, heroine has been classified as one of the most addictive and detrimental. In a recent research study run by the Institute of Narcotic Examination in Rollesque, Nevada, heroine ranked 2.89 out of 3 on a dependence rating scale (Perez 465). This result was also confirmed by scores of research studies held in London by the Academy of Pharmaceutical Studies (Perez 236). An opiate processed from morphine, heroine is delineated as a lethal drug. The common form of heroine sold in streets looks like a white or brown gummy substance with a high consistency of tar.\n\nHeroine is injected into the human body through a hypothermic needle directly in a muscle or a particular blood vein. It can also be smoked like cigarettes. There is the possibility of it being successfully mixed with drugs or snorted as cocaine. Street heroine is often mixed with other substances like sugar, starch, quinine, poisons, or even powdered milk to dilute the effect. Short and long-term effects of heroine use have different levels of withdrawal, reinforcements, tolerance, dependency, and intoxication. Heroine reduces pain and mimics the traits of endorphins, which causes the human brain to experience pleasure (Hollow 67). The central neural system becomes supersaturated with endorphine-like substances, and when the effect of heroine ends, individuals begin to feel the need for a new injection to prolong pleasure (Hollow 87).\n\nThe degree of heroine addictiveness can be measured by the severe withdrawal symptoms which it induces in individuals. Among the most common symptoms, one can enlist the following: a warm flush feeling in the skin, an ill mood and depression, vomiting, itching, nausea, and heavy pain in joints. The cardiac functions and the neural system functions slow down, though it often depends on the individual’s genetic type, amount of the drug taken, and the purity of the substance (Hollow 56).\n\nHeroin addiction causes numerous side effects to the physical body. Blood vein structures collapse, and a risk of receiving a heart infection, liver disease, or abscesses dramatically increases. Long-term addiction to the drug takes the form of a chronic, relapsing disease. Long-term use of heroine prompts users to gradually increase doses. Once a user is in the chronic stage, this implies such symptoms as restlessness, bone and muscle pain, insomnia, and intense withdrawal stages lasting for 24 to 48 hours after heroine has been taken (Lichter 765).###"}
{"prompt":"What are some strategies that can be used to fight terrorism?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Terrorism is defined as the “use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims” (Oxford, 2010). There is a phenomenon of ruthless individuals sharing radical political ideologies that seek to cause harm to others for achieving their goals. Thus, it is important to enact appropriate measures to counteract these intended detrimental actions. Among the possible strategies offered to fight terrorism are to ensure prosecution, freeze funds of people and organizations suspected to be involved in terroristic activities, and to protect vulnerable targets.\n\nTerrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN Security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001). Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorist activities are not always favorable. For example, “The Cuban government continued to permit fugitives wanted in the Unites States to reside … And also provided support, such as housing, food ration books, and medical care for these individuals” (Country Reports on Terrorism, 2001). While proclaiming to be a country that is anti-terroristic, the Cuban government continues to provide a safe haven for terrorists, and does not cooperate with the U.S. Ensuring prosecution of these individuals by encouraging safe-haven countries to cooperate is key strategy in fighting terrorism.\n\nA substantial amount of funds is required to fuel terrorism. Often this money comes from the sale of illegal drugs, weapons, or even slaves. This money is used to “…pay for the training camps, recruitment, conventional and unconventional weapons, travel, safe houses, propaganda…” (Ehrenfeld, 2002). In order to douse this fuel, such strategies as freezing funds should be implemented. Usually, funds received from illegal activities not only take up too much space, but are also far too heavy to transport in the form of physical bills. This is the reason why funds are transferred digitally through international bank accounts. If terrorist leaders’ accounts would be frozen, terroristic organizations would no longer have the essential resources to perform terroristic acts. Encouraging countries to set up proper tracking within banking systems is a vital step towards eliminating terrorism.\n\nTo diminish terrorism, the proper protection of vulnerable targets should be taken into consideration. According to the UN, upon request, “INTERPOL will assist member countries seeking either to develop protection strategies or enhance establish strategies by securing suitable assistance…” (Working Group on Strengthening the Protection of Vulnerable Targets, 2010), which means establishing protection over valuable potential targets of terroristic attacks. This measure is a smart step, but there is still much work to do to expand it worldwide, as not every country in the world is a member of this protective program. The UN should create a special international council that would work on developing protection strategies. Protecting vulnerable targets must remain a top priority for each country in the world.\n\nTerrorism is an unpredictable and volatile phenomenon which possesses a threat to the natural human right to live without fear. It is a tool of intimidation, aimed to achieve political goals and to impose propaganda. Ensuring prosecution, freezing funds of terroristic organizations, and protecting vulnerable targets, combined together, are essential strategies to fight terrorism.###"}
{"prompt":"What made Vincent van Gogh one of the most famous artists in history?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Vincent van Gogh was a person with a difficult and dramatic life. He was a poor, unknown artist suffering from a mental disease. But his perseverance, use of art as a skill to cope with illness, dedication to art, and the support of his brother helped him to keep on painting. He developed his own style of impasto painting and pushed the boundaries of impressionism. This approach to art set van Gogh’s place among the most famous artists in history, and though he died unknown, now his name is synonymous with being an artist.\n\nWhen van Gogh stayed at the mental hospital in Saint-Remy, he used painting as a coping mechanism to help himself deal with his symptoms. It is a well-known fact that van Gogh had psychological problems; once, he attacked his friend Gauguin, and according to the most popular version of the story from historians, after that he cut half of his ear off with a razor. The admitting physician described Vincent van Gogh’s symptoms as mania with hallucinations (Van Gogh Museum, 2005). During his hospitalization, he created 150 paintings. Instead of allowing himself to get discouraged during his stay at the hospital, van Gogh persevered and continued to work on his paintings.\n\nThroughout van Gogh’s life, his brother Theo was a source of financial and emotional support. Though Theo is often credited with introducing the world to Vincent van Gogh’s art, his efforts might have failed without the support of Theo’s wife, Johanna van Gogh. After all, Theo died two months after Vincent (Righthand, 2010). Through Theo’s showing of Vincent’s work, he had begun to gain some notoriety. However, Johanna prized Vincent’s art and relied on selling some of the paintings to help support her young son (Righthand, 2010).\n\nVan Gogh was a prolific artist. He painted for 10 years, and during this period of time, he created 860 pieces of art (Van Gogh Museum, 2005). His paintings demonstrate a clear style of movement and color in thick layers of paint. Artists cannot gain attention without having an original, notable style of their own—so van Gogh worked on developing his distinct style. Instead of merely copying the impressionism style popular back then, he transformed it into his own; now van Gogh is recognized as being an artist of post-impressionism.\n\nVincent van Gogh became one of the most famous artists in history. He used art as a tool to fight his mental illness. Despite his difficulties, he diligently worked on his paintings; with the help of his family, he dedicated 10 years of his life to producing an incredible number of paintings. After his death, his family continued to promote Vincent’s work. With van Gogh’s well-defined style and numerous works, he became an artist adored globally postmortem.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the most dangerous drug of the 21st century?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" There are numerous well-trodden ways for modern citizens to be distracted from their stress by external measures. Alcohol, chemical drugs, cigarettes, marijuana, the Internet, TV shows, video games, and many other legal and illegal forms of diversion can alleviate stress—if not only temporarily. Many of these occupations cause heavy addiction, though. The strongest instances of addiction occur when individuals intake illegal drugs. Almost all of them are dangerous for a human’s physical and psychological health. Back in the 1990s, cocaine was treated as the most dangerous drug, but recent studies reveal a surprising fact that nicotine can be considered the most addictive drug of the 21st century (Lawrence, 2002).\n\nA drug, in a general sense, is a substance with certain chemical properties that has the ability to disrupt the functions of an individual’s body. It can be used for treatment, diagnosis, or for recreational activities. Some kinds of drugs can also affect the nervous system of a person’s body and prove to be quite dangerous; the most hazardous are those are listed under the category of psychoactive drugs. These are substances with chemical properties that affect or modify brain functions and result in changed behavior, altered frames of mind, and deviations in thought processes. One of such psychoactive drugs is the well-known and legal nicotine.\n\nPeople can take in nicotine from many natural sources, mostly in doses that are not malignant for human health. However, consuming nicotine through cigarettes, cigars, or by smoking pipes is quite different. Doctor Richard Lawrence observed that numerous harmful effects of nicotine were consumed by farmers through tobacco leaves (Lawrence, 2002). Nicotine can be found in many food products, and in small amounts it does not cause harm; however, despite being legal, nicotine is extremely addictive, and leads to strong psychological and physical addiction (Shaw, 2001). Research on popular addictive drugs also place nicotine at the top of the most dangerous drugs list. Nicotine is on the same alignment with the harmful effects caused by cocaine, morphine, or alcohol (Michaelshouse.com). The most common symptoms attributed to nicotine’s abuse are anxiety, sleeping disorders, a lack of concentration, irritability, and severe headaches. Pure nicotine is extremely poisonous, and may even cause death.\n\nOne positive factor is that nicotine addiction can be effectively treated. There are many means used in replacement therapy to treat this addiction. Among the most popular ways are nicotine-containing chewing gum, inhalers, nasal sprays, and skin patches. It is extremely important for nicotine addicts who want to achieve long-lasting soberness to join treatment programs, otherwise the ailment may return and will cause even more harm to patients.\n\nAmong many drugs that are present on the market today, nicotine may be called the most dangerous one to human beings. Due to the fact that nicotine is legal, cigarettes and other products that contain nicotine can be easily purchased at almost every public market. Nicotine as a psychoactive drug forms a strong addiction, and has such negative effects on its user as anxiety, sleeping disorders, a lack of concentration, irritability, and severe headaches. Nowadays, one of the most effective ways to treat addiction to nicotine is replacement therapy, when a patient consumes products with low levels of nicotine in them, such as special chewing gums, nasal sprays, inhalators, or skin patches.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the consequences of overpopulation?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Back in 8000 B.C., the world was inhabited by a measly 5 million people, roughly the population of Papua New Guinea today. Currently, Earth contains 7 billion people (Then and now, n.d.). The world faces the problem of severe overpopulation; the global population continues to rise at a rate of roughly 78 million people per year, most of which are born in sub-Saharan Africa and the south and west of Asia. Such a massive population is difficult to sustain, since the resources needed for such a sustenance are limited. This results into a grim hope for future generations. Therefore, the problem of overpopulation needs to be solved in the nearest future.\n\nThe root cause of unwanted population growth around the world cannot be pinned-down to one reason. It is a complex, multi-faceted issue with a myriad of affecting factors. If history is any evidence, population explosions have coincided with three major technological progressive movements, marking significant eras in the history of time. These are the tool-making revolution, the agricultural revolution, and the industrial revolution (Deevey.E.S., The Human Population, 1960). Additionally, scientific leaps help reduce causes of death, causing the birthrate to exceed the death rate. For example, owing to improved sanitation, child immunization and advanced medicine, today about 95% of newborns in industrialized nations reach adulthood (McKeown, The Origins of Human Disease, 1988). From a psychological perspective, poverty stricken households with less-educated backgrounds tend to overcompensate for their lack of capabilities by having a large number of children.\n\nEarth can uphold 1\/7th of its current population in order to give each inhabitant a high quality standard of living. The existing world scenario paints a dim picture. Resource shortages, environmental disasters, multi-layered pollution, mass species extinction, soil erosion, the destruction of forest cover, high infant mortality rates, elevated crimes, inflation, and so forth are only some of the many negative consequences of overpopulation. The Chair of the National Academy of Sciences Panel on Global Warming calls population growth the driving force in global warming (Global Population Concerns, n.d). Industrial and housing projects cannot be handled by the limited land and resources present in today’s world. The unimaginable hike in fuel prices is bound to increase in demand for the energy-producing resources that Earth cannot cater.\n\nThe solution for overpopulation is far from easy to implement. Expensive and painstaking campaign strategies have been employed to curb this global dilemma, but no affirmative action has proven effective enough. China has managed to reduce its population through legal affirmative action: the first offspring of a family receives free education and healthcare up to adulthood, but the second offspring is not given these advantages. The Indian ‘Us Two, Our Two’ campaign was targeted at inculcating family planning in the mindsets of the lower sections of Indian society.\n\nDespite capitalist views, such as the rise in population undeniably benefits investors and entrepreneurs as a larger audience virtually facilitates growth in the global economy, overpopulation is detrimental (Trivium, What is the Ideal Population of the World, 2009). A larger population may benefit business markets and its industries, but population control is in the best interests of the world at large. Earth does not have infinite resources, and there are only so many mouths it can feed, and only so many bodies it can house. There is a pressing need to stabilize the world’s population.###"}
{"prompt":"How does the human mind evolve?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" According to Charles Darwin, humanity was not created by some higher outer force, but evolved from lower species. Also, his theory presumes that evolution is an ongoing process; therefore, not only animals and plants continue to evolve, but so does humanity. And while human bodies do not seem to transform visibly, the human mind and the way of thinking changes significantly from generation to generation, boosted by developing technologies, the constantly accelerating pace of life, and the knowledge left from our predecessors.\n\nThe choices people make every day define how their lives change. By experience, people learn to distinguish “right” and “wrong” choices based on the consequences of the decisions they made. This is how thinking evolves. Anne E. Russon and David R. Begun, in their book The Evolution of Thought, say that apes are shown to be the closest relatives to the human species specifically due to a phenomenon they call a symbolic cognitive process. It “operates on the basis of mental images rather than direct sensory-motor phenomena” (Begun, para. 1). This means the brain thinks, considers, and decides based on visual memory, not on instinctive reaction. People constantly acquire information, altering the choices they make in a given situation based on what they have seen and learned. Due to this mechanism, in a case of an emergency, people can respond and act consciously and reasonably using not only their natural instincts like “fight or flight” or a previous experience, but also borrowed knowledge and achieved skills, thus increasing one’s chances to survive. For example, if one sees a car crash, they will call an ambulance not because nature encumbered them with such a type of reaction to external events, and not because one had already faced a similar situation, but due to obtained knowledge.\n\nSurvival is the main and possibly only reason for evolution of any kind. Survival determines the necessity of existence of any instinct, as well as any knowledge obtained. Birds know when to fly south or else they would freeze to death. People as well learn to avoid danger or cooperate in extreme situations in order to survive. Due to the Black Plague in Medieval times, the importance of hygiene was learned by humanity, and once a method of maintaining hygiene in the streets was established, the plague diminished. Scientists developed a way to fight tuberculosis, and today doctors vaccinate people, making them immune to this disease. This way, the human body is constantly evolving as well to better protect itself. Therefore, not only the way of thinking and acting is important for survival, but also the physical condition of a human body.\n\nTo pass all collected knowledge onto future generations and thus help them survive, people make records of the knowledge they obtained. The paintings on the walls of the Lascaux cave, scrolls containing records about the movement of stars, medical books describing how to cut open the human body—what the human race has learned and discovered is recorded and passed on, so that anyone can pick out a book and find what they need. Even now, people are constantly striving for knowledge of the unknown, such as extraterrestrial life or the world below the sea (Howard, 234). The evolution of thoughts runs much faster than the evolution of the body, since the lust for new knowledge can be explained by a need to prepare for what may come in the future, to feel more confident in front of the unknown, and thus guarantee survival.\n\nThe aspiration to survive is a powerful factor in the evolution of human species. People pass on their knowledge and experiences to further generations to help them avoid repeating certain mistakes; stated succinctly, each generation prepares a starting ground for future ones. While human bodies do not seem to change significantly, and its functions remain relatively the same, the mind is constantly exposed to various influences and challenges. Transformation and adaptation are required to face these obstacles. The more developed and advanced the human race becomes, the more challenges people face, therefore the faster evolutionary processes go.\n\nReference\n\nBegun, David R. & Russon, Anne E.

{"prompt":"What are the implications of Gurdon and Yamanaka's research on stem cells?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine is awarded to researchers who manage to make revolutionary or significant discoveries in their fields. This contributes greatly to the understanding of how organisms function and how to cure diseases previously considered non-treatable. In 2012, the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was awarded to two scientists: John B. Gurdon of the University of Cambridge in England, and Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University in Japan.\n\nYamanaka and Gurdon produced groundbreaking research in a controversial study of stem cells. Their experiments focused on manipulating living cells and generating so-called pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). “They discovered that a mature, adult cell can be turned back to an infant, versatile state called a stem cell” (France-Presse, 2012). Studying stem cells, as it is expected, will cause a breakthrough in curing a wide variety of degenerative diseases. Gurdon and Yamanaka were the first scientists to prove that iPSCs could be created in a laboratory environment, rather than harvested from aborted fetuses, thus avoiding the highly controversial moral issues driving anti-abortion activists’ arguments concerning human life. Stem cell research can now be conducted without controversy, and people with a wide variety of degenerative diseases can have hope for a cure (Cook, 2012).\n\nThe research of Gurdon and Yamanaka are 40 years apart and represent many separate milestones. They did not work on this project together. Gurdon was working on cloning with tadpoles in 1962, and Yamanaka discovered how to reprogram mature human cells so that they could revert to their primitive state. Gurdon’s work demonstrated that cells contained the same genetic code and that individual cells were capable of creating an entire animal if manipulated. His work has become the basis for the cloning procedure. Yamanaka took that understanding and built his research on it. Using mouse skin cells, he returned them to an embryonic state and demonstrated how these cells could then redevelop into any part of the body (Holmes, 2012).\n\nThe two prize winners’ work has revolutionized not only the way scientists think about cells, but it has also laid the foundations for cures of many diseases. Scientists all over the world are studying cells that have been damaged, such as those damaged by Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. They are examining each disease at the cellular level so they can understand them. Scientists are hoping to replace damaged cells with healthy ones, as well as find therapies that can help control degenerative diseases. Other physical ailments this discovery can help with are type 1 diabetes, serious spinal cord injuries, and muscular degeneration. Doctors are giving heart attack victims infusions of cardiac stem cells to increase the vitality of the heart muscle and to help it pump. Also, special stem cells are used in trials for patients with retinal disease, which causes blindness, to determine whether stem cells can restore their sight (Holmes, 2012).\n\nYamanaka and Gurdon were awarded the Noble Prize because their revolutionary discovery removed roadblocks to further scientific research. Controversy has hampered research in this area of science, even though it has the potential to make life better for people and also to save many lives. Previously, governments around the world had forbidden experimentation on human embryos and the Vatican had condemned the studies. All of those arguments concerning stem cell research have been removed.\n\nStem cell research has been a controversial topic for years. Yamanaka purposefully attempted to develop a procedure that would push science forward as well as silence critics. The Nobel Prize Committee awarded the prize to these two scientists because of the potential to research further into areas that will benefit humankind.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the most probable causes and factors of obesity in the United States?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" It has long been debated whether obesity is a relative measure and should not be used as a stigma to label overweight people. However, the fact is, when the weight of a person significantly exceeds a certain norm for their age and gender, the health and well-being of a person tends to generally decrease in quality. Obesity might not be a serious disease in the commonly established meaning of this term, since it is not contagious like the flu, irreversible like AIDs, or deadly like cancer. Yet it has been proven there are numerous links to a higher probability of heart-related diseases, depression and passiveness, diabetes, and premature aging of the body as a whole and the brain in particular. Moreover, obesity decreases the general quality of life, since it becomes difficult for an obese person to enjoy simple activities, stay energetic and active, succeed in sports, and enjoy a full-range diet. Thus, when talking about obesity in a country like America, where the problem is especially acute and critical, we need to consider the most probable causes and factors of obesity in order to come up with an effective health program to deal with this issue in the United States.\n\nObesity can be argued to be genetically predisposed and there is little governments and NGOs can do about this fact. It is true that some people are born with a higher probability of being overweight and eventually obese than others (Porps 73). However, such predisposition cannot be considered a purely “American problem” since it is almost equally spread amongst different races and ethnicities. Statistically, around 20% of people in the world suffer from obesity. However, this number is significantly higher for the US population. Thus, we need to look at those factors that could explain why the problem of obesity is more serious in America than in, for example, Germany, Russia, or Brazil. One of such factors is the factor of eating habits.\n\nAmericans have a tendency towards substantial fast food and soft drink consumption. Eating french fries, pizza, cheeseburgers, and drinking Coca-Cola are the top metabolism inhibitors in modern American society. By consuming such foods and drinks regularly, American teenagers, adults, and children slow down their metabolism by up to 12 times, as research has proven (Henrix 122). This means the same amount of food will be digested and absorbed 12 times slower by an American teen than by a healthy-eating Russian or African child. Moreover, numerous health issues such as ulcers, dysbacteriosis, cholecystitis, and diabetes, which are also directly related to one’s eating habits, have a negative influence on a person’s weight and the amount of fat in a body. Hence, when working towards decreasing obesity rates, we need to start from completely changing our dietary habits and refraining from eating fast foods or drinking soft drinks.\n\nAnother point to consider when talking about American dieting habits is the lack of fresh fruits and vegetables in their everyday ration. We seem to think a glass of orange juice, watered down from concentrate and flavored with artificial sweeteners, or a few grapes on top of a cupcake for dessert, or a bowl of spinach salad for dinner, does the trick and provides the necessary amount of vitamins, microelements, and minerals for our body and mind. However, this is far from being true, as dietitians inform. Five different fruits and five different vegetables a day is the minimum requirement for healthy development (Parker 56). The key is to eat in variety and to eat fresh, garden-grown products. In the United States, there are few places where fresh, recently-picked, and naturally-grown fruits and vegetables are sold at local markets. In the majority of cases, it is the supermarket chains which distribute such products to Americans across the country. Fruit and vegetables from a supermarket, like Wallmart or Safeway, do not supply us with even half of the valuable nutrients compared to fruits and vegetables from one’s own garden, picked right before consumption and grown without using pesticides and fertilizers.\n\nUnfortunately, keeping our own gardens and growing our own fruits and vegetables is not an act most Americans are able or willing to do. Then, is there a solution? Organic food, which many consider to be rather pricy, is in fact much healthier than what we are offered in the regular chain supermarkets. When it comes to health, prevention and precaution are less expensive than the treatment afterwards. The solution that is most suitable for an average American family is to shop organic, fresh, and healthy, choosing vegetables and fruits over unhealthy calorie-booster snacks like chips, pretzels, and donuts (Open 43).\n\nOne more important factor we often forget about when investigating the reasons for high obesity rates in the United States is the factor of portion size. Comparative studies have often proven the size of an average serving portion in America is many times higher than in the majority of other countries. For instance, one portion of pasta in an average American middle-class restaurant can be split into 3.6 Japanese portions, 3.2 Chinese portions, 3.1 French portions, 2.8 Russian portions, 2.3 Polish portions and 2.2 Italian portions (Kin 21). Do Americans need to eat this much? We are not the tallest or the most active nation in the world, but for some reason, we consume twice as much as the Dutch, who ride bicycles while we drive cars, or the Russians, who walk by foot an average of 2.9 miles a day while we barely do half a mile. Americans are getting used to eating more than their body needs since early childhood. Next time we go to a restaurant to order a full bowl of salad followed by a huge plate of spaghetti and a glass of ice tea, we need to remind ourselves how our stomachs are only the size of an average man’s fist normally, but not if you stuff it with loads of food.\n\nWhether we like to admit it or not, obesity is a problem for Americans. The quality of life and the state of health of Americans is much lower than it should be. Some may argue they try to live an active life, doing sports and participate in community activities, but they still have weight problems. This is the case for many Americans who forget that along with changing their lifestyle, going to a gym and running in the mornings, they need to cardinally change their eating habits, consume more fresh and healthy natural foods, stop eating junk food, lessen their portions by half and start eating smart.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the benefits of learning a foreign language?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Learning new languages is considered an investment in one’s success. There are examples of folklore sayings, such as, “You are as many times a man, as many languages you speak” (Slavic proverb), or that “You live as many lives as many languages you know” (Czech folk song). These days, such opinions can be considered truer than ever. It is not just diplomats and interpreters who are obliged to learn languages. In the twenty-first century, the process of globalization has expanded further than ever, and people all over the world are becoming more interconnected. Whether one is working for a big international corporation, or frequently travels abroad for leisure, enjoys watching foreign movies with the original soundtrack, or simply want to widen one’s horizons, learning a second or third language is a wonderful decision.\n\nHowever, while most of the developing world is keen on learning more than just the native language of their home country, Americans tend to skip this part of education, or learn foreign languages rather perfunctorily. David Ricker, Professor in Linguistics at the University of Maine, having conducted a country-wide research on the issue, reported that only 17.8% of adult Americans, across the country, can fluently speak, and correctly write, in one or more foreign language (Ricker 22). This number is extremely low for a developed society. To put this into perspective, 86.1% of Germans, 74% of Swedes, and 59.6% of Russians are fluent in at least one foreign language. This number is even higher among some of the population in Asia.\n\nWhile Americans also have Spanish, German, French, and Japanese classes in their high school and college curricula, the quality of knowledge that American children and teenagers receive is considerably lower. One of the major reasons that researchers cite is the lack of motivation. While the rest of the world finds it a necessity to know a couple of other languages other than a native one, many Americans see no point in learning any other language since, in most cases, their English will be understood anyway whenever they travel (Sallck 28). We all realize that English is unofficially the modern-day international and business language, but it does not mean that Americans should use this advantage against themselves.\n\nLearning languages at an early age is beneficial for several reasons. It aids a child to effectively develop their organs of articulation and speak more clearly, including in their native tongue (Jess 32). Learning another language means widening one’s mental outlook, and becoming more adept and knowledgeable about the world’s cultures and perspectives. In addition, learning a language greatly contributes to general brain development, especially at an early age, but also at any age. It helps make our minds more flexible, our articulation more adaptable, and our memory more retentive (Sallck, 29).\n\nFurthermore, taking into consideration the specifics of American society, it would only be logical that Americans should speak more than one language. With the United States being a melting pot of cultures, nationalities, and ethnicities, being diverse in every way they can is what being an American is about (Prestan 12). Americans are interested in other cultures, cuisines, and costumes, but do not show any particular attention to the folklore, songs, and languages of the people whose national restaurants they frequently visit. If we also reminded ourselves how much Americans travel, including travelling abroad, it is surely a shame that so few people in the United States know and speak a language other than English. Identifying yourself not just as a citizen of the United States of America, but also as a world inhabitant together with the Chinese, Russians, French, and Nigerians means broadening one’s perspective and integrating into the global social medium.\n\nDepriving American children and teenagers from learning another language automatically means neglecting their future development. Creating favorable conditions for learning languages at schools, and stimulating children’s motivation towards it is investing in the future of our children’s overall success. Showing interest in another culture, language, and tradition does not in any way mean withdrawing from your own background. Quite the contrary, it shows one’s respect and tolerance, intelligence, and refinement. I see no reason why American society should be at the tail position when it comes to speaking foreign languages. Inspiring American children to be interested and motivated them learn languages is what both the educational institutions and parents should focus on.###"}
{"prompt":"What are the long-term implications of the Internet's influence on society?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Computers once had a singular purpose: to solve mathematical equations. Rapid advances in computer technology have altered the way in which people interact with computers, as well as the functionality of these intelligent machines. With the advent of a worldwide and nearly universally accessible Internet, the way in which we interact with each other has changed drastically. People from all over the world can instantaneously exchange both business and personal information. Internet commerce has become a huge part of the daily lives of millions, as well as social networking and streaming media. Most recently, portable electronics capable of nearly all internet-related tasks have become a common possession for the average American. The unlimited free exchange of information has changed and is continuing to shift American society at large in a profound way.\n\n“The internet is probably most famous for the ability to spread information, fact or fiction” (Nikolovska, 2007). Despite the many positive influences the Internet has had on our society, one cannot ignore the negative repercussions. Many vendors have become faceless, and the examination of goods prior to purchase has been reduced to pictures. While there are many reputable online stores, there are those with less ethical aims. People must be wary of any and all information sharing and purchases conducted online to avoid the transfer of funds or personal data to unscrupulous entities. Likewise, information obtained via the Internet needs to be scrutinized in order to determine accuracy. According to the 2010 U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator Annual Report on Intellectual Property Enforcement “The digital environment… presents enormous challenges to businesses, consumers, governments, citizens, communities, and families, particularly as new technologies and platforms disrupt traditional business models, means of governance and modes of private communication and expression.” In essence, the Internet has begun to change nearly every aspect of our lives and shows no signs of stopping.\n\nPersonal safety threats related to the popularity of social networks, especially among the youth, is another huge Internet-related issue. “They are taking us somewhere exciting, but we have to work out how we deal with the fading boundaries these tools have left in their wake, and that means rewriting our social rules as we go along” (Hoover, 2009). With the human race being a social species by nature, it was inevitable that new advanced methods of communication would eventually be developed. The Internet has revolutionized interpersonal communication since its inception with advances such as email and instant messaging. More recently, websites devoted entirely to communication have emerged. The most popular example of such social networks is Facebook. Members input personal data, upload photographs, and personalize many aspects of their own unique pages within the site. They may then connect and share this information with as many people as they desire. Social networks have gained such popularity that one is nearly certain to find their friends and coworkers via online means.\n\nWith so many people uploading personal information, targeted marketing has become easy and popular. Because of this precise demographic and specific marketing capabilities, social networks are extremely profitable. But there is always the downside, and with social networking it is primarily the issue of trust and safety. Social networking puts its users in danger from those members of the web who may pose as someone they are not and should not be trusted. When you only know a person over a short period of time and have never before met in person, it is easy for that person to create a desirable self-image in your head, and this image might have nothing to do with reality. When we expose our lives to the Internet’s community, we become vulnerable, whether we realize it or not.\n\nGiven the degree of impact the Internet has had on American society in its relatively short existence, the long-term implications are unforeseeable. A world in which all people may communicate openly with one another, regardless of the physical distance between them, was once no more than a tempting idea, but is now the norm. The world is analogous to an organism, and to quote a fictional doctor: “All organisms evolve and develop along patterns only recognized in retrospect.” It will probably be not sooner than until we experience the results of the Internet’s influence on society that we may be able to evaluate them.###"}
{"prompt":"What is the basis for marijuana's medical use?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Marijuana refers to a drug derived from dried leaves, stems, and flowers of the cannabis plant. Cannabis sativa, as it is known scientifically, bears a chemical known as “delta-9 teterahydrocannabinol” (THC in short) that alters mind functions of the user (Cohen, 2006). This ingredient is rapidly absorbed a short while after a user intakes the drug. It affects areas of the brain dealing with memory, perception, concentration, and movement. This causes short-term physiological medical effects that include rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, increased blood pressure, dry mouth, red eyes, slowed reaction time, and increased appetite. Although these effects recede after 3 to 4 hours, cannabis remains in the system for about 24 hours after smoking. Psychologically, pot smoking causes euphoria, explaining the reason smokers habitually want to ‘get high’ or ‘stoned.’ In addition, pot smoking causes short-term psychological effects such as a discordant sense of time, paranoia, hallucination, anxiety, depression, and short-term memory loss (Younts, 2005).\n\nThe use of marijuana in the United States starts at an early age of between 12 and 17, usually due to peer pressure and curiosity. For several decades now, many youngsters have believed that smoking marijuana is no big deal—it simply helps to stave off stress and to have fun. Furthermore, some adults are also convinced that pot is relatively ‘safe’ when compared with other hard drugs like cocaine or heroin (Cohen, 2006). However, the truth is quite the opposite of this commonly held belief. Having thoroughly examined the harm of all known psychoactive drugs and narcotic substances for the human body and society overall, British scientists named marijuana the eighth most dangerous drug (The Lancet, 2007). The United States Congress entrenched marijuana in Schedule I of the Controlled Substance Act after agreeing that it had “no acceptable medical use.” Yet today, of the total 50 states, 16 have legalized the medical use of cannabis. Medical cannabis is claimed to be a safe and useful treatment for such medical conditions as cancer, pain, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy, among others. This essay attempts to determine whether using marijuana for medical purposes is based on empirical data or rather a populist myth.\n\nIf marijuana were just another common drug, its appropriateness for use as a medical substance would certainly be left to the discretion of physicians and patients. However, this decision is caught up in modern-day politics of drug warfare. Physicians and patients who get involved with the use of marijuana face grave consequences from the authorities, who seem to be bent on maximizing the fear and uncertainty, which people who might benefit from marijuana use face.\n\nHowever, volumes of peer-reviewed studies, major government reports, independent research materials, actions of eminent medical organizations, and the history of medical use of marijuana prove that marijuana’s medical use is viable and safe (Younts, 2005). Researchers have confirmed that THC is effective in blocking pain signals going to the central nervous system by tracking the biochemical path followed by pain signals from an injury, via the spine, to the brain. Why would authorities, physicians, and patients ignore any drug that has the capability of relieving pain from these terminal diseases and which does not have the significant side effects of synthetic pain killers?\n\nMoreover, marijuana use for medical purposes appears to be more effective compared to other mainstream painkilling drugs (Younts, 2005). In many instances, refusing to extend cannabis treatment to deserving patients is not only cruel, but also unnecessary. Treating the terminally ill does not pose a public threat, or open up more loopholes for trafficking, as many anti-marijuana activists argue. In most states, a large majority approves of its use in medical cases, and the federal government needs therefore to adjust its laws to accommodate the interests of the majority in the various states.\n\nIn 2010, the state of New Jersey approved a bill (S119) seeking to legalize medical cannabis for use by patients with severe chronic illnesses. Governor Jon Corzine signed the bill into state law, and it sets out the grounds on which medical marijuana is to be distributed to state-authorized patients. The patients who stand to benefit from this law are those suffering from glaucoma, cancer, seizures, multiple sclerosis, Lou Gehrig’s disease, muscular dystrophy, inflammatory bowel disease, HIV\/AIDS, and any other terminal diseases which a doctor says will cause the death of a patient within a year. Moreover, the law also authorizes the state’s Department of Health to permit the use of medical cannabis for patients with other similar conditions (Kocieniewski, 2010). Authorized patients will be required to carry an identification card with the due approval of the Department of Health, renewable yearly.\n\nContrary to federal law, the New Jersey medical marijuana law recognizes cannabis as possessing “potential therapeutic value,” especially in relation to pain, nausea, anxiety, appetite stimulation, and the treatment of vomiting. However, patients prescribed medical marijuana are not allowed to cultivate their own cannabis and can only be in possession of two ounces of this drug per month. Opponents of the law cited medical marijuana abuse in other states like California. Nevertheless, people from other states that have not legalized medical cannabis are seeking similar law reforms to save themselves and their loved ones from excruciating pain caused by specific diseases (Fassa, 2011).\n\nThose still opposed to medical cannabis clearly miss the point. The available scientific evidence on medical marijuana benefits is sufficient enough to warrant its legalization. The legalization of marijuana for medical purposes also carries tremendous potential for streamlining the federal budget. Although a seemingly leftist idea, the act of legalizing and levying taxes on marijuana would help reduce the budget deficit and create job opportunities for many people. Domestically-cultivated marijuana comes only second to corn as the largest cash crop in the U.S. Its legalization would require removing it from Schedule I, so that it becomes a non-scheduled drug, just like nicotine, alcohol, ibuprofen, or caffeine (Younts, 2005). Drugs that fall under Schedule I include opiates, opiate derivatives, depressants, stimulants, and psychedelic substances.\n\nMillions of dollars are spent yearly to arrest cannabis traffickers or users, bringing them to trial and eventually maintaining them in United States prisons. The government, through its health system, also loses a lot of money by providing wasteful treatments to patients with terminal illnesses, instead of allowing them access to cheap and effective medical cannabis. The money saved, as a result, can be used to offset state and federal budget deficits (Fassa, 2011). Every state faces a budget crisis, and legalizing medical cannabis would go a long way in filling the budget gap.\n\nWith 28 million Americans already partaking in smoking marijuana for recreational purposes, opponents of the move to legalize medical cannabis argue that its legalization would increase its recreational use. They also contend that it would be too dangerous because the drug lacks approval from the FDA, and that it is addictive. There is also the argument that marijuana acts as a stepping-stone to the use of harder drugs (Younts, 2005). There is plenty evidence of people who became hooked to cannabis. However, other strong chemical painkillers are much more dangerous and cause even stronger addiction. Alcohol, the drug responsible for more deaths worldwide each year than marijuana, cocaine, and heroin combined was ranked the #1 most dangerous substance, yet it is completely legal in the US and most of the world (The Lancet, 2007). Additionally, scientific research confirms that cannabis is not as addictive as most government sources love to claim. Smoking marijuana sparingly is not capable of causing long-term afflictions such as lung cancer, lowered testosterone levels, or even physical and psychological addiction.\n\nLegalizing medical cannabis would make this affordable and all-natural drug available to deserving patients, which would in turn improve their quality of life (Shohov, 2003). Leaving a person to suffer when the means to help them are right there is inhumane and in contradiction with the laws of nature. Legalizing medical cannabis would also make its use controllable and provide valuable insight into the nature of the ingredients it possesses. Experts would be able to determine the necessary healing dosage, and pharmaceutical firms would invest in more in-depth research on the healing properties of marijuana (Shohov, 2003).\n\nCurrent laws on marijuana use take away the freedom of choice from both doctors and patients. Such laws ought to be repealed in light of the reliable research data that confirms the valuable medical properties of marijuana. Patients suffering from acute conditions who can benefit from cannabis use should not be subjected to the same treatment as criminal peddling, or using cannabis for recreational purposes. The political controversy surrounding cannabis use should not be allowed to extend to the physician’s office, and into hospital rooms and households. The controversy needs to be restrained, and deserving patients accorded due help. That is being humane.\n\n###"}
{"prompt":"How has the role of occupational therapists changed in recent years in Canada, and what are the implications of these changes?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Recently, North America has seen an immense change as far as its health sector is concerned. An overwhelming statistical revelation has indicated that Canada, for instance, has witnessed a great many shifts in the health and social needs of its citizens (Rickter, Health Care is North America). Owing to this realization, several aspects have been prompted to be transformed. This particular paper seeks to take a keen overview of occupational therapy—one of the most distinguished fields affected by the current trends in the Canadian healthcare system. Analyzing current trends of health in Canada plays a pivotal role in placing occupational therapists abreast of the new changes. As a result, occupational therapists are in a position to identify opportunities, as well as challenges, which are a threat to their profession, and thus embark on effective means to counter them.\n\nAs we speak, occupational therapy in Canada has expanded in order to incorporate home and community care. This is a variance when compared to traditional approaches, when occupational therapists were only found in a hospital setting (Francis, Occupational Therapy Records and History). However, this is not the only reality we encounter in the modern Canadian health sector. It is regarded as just one of the major consequences of the emerging trends in Canadian health care. First and foremost, Canada has made great advances in biology, particularly advancements in genetics, notwithstanding the growing prospect of personalized health care.\n\nThis is an emerging trend that has directly affected the profession of occupational therapy. Critics have reported that a senior leader of the Canadian health sector, Grant Seplin, has flagged biology as the most exciting and fast moving science in comparison with other scientific disciplines (Hendren, Scales and Whales). This has seen Canada undertake many scientific developments, such as individualized medicines and new diagnostics.\n\nThe intensification of knowledge owing to substantial levels of knowledge in the medical field has played a key role in the realization of new therapies. From this knowledge, several projections are subject to be made and which are likely to depict a true and fair view of Canada’s future health status. A major probability is that the healthcare system is likely to become individualized, whereby people will be in a position to identify and treat what is ailing them (Curtis,Change in Individualized Health Care). This implies that the role of occupational therapy in Canada’s health system is bound to change profoundly with individuals becoming their own health caregivers.\n\nImmigration and diversity are also identified as a major emerging trend facing the Canadian heath sector. The effects of immigration and diversity are not subject to neglect, as they have major consequences on the state of occupational therapy. Sources report that the birth rate in Canada is ranked as one of the world’s slowest (Gerald, Statistical Reporting, Canada. This has an obvious implication, as a large portion of Canada’s population is comprised of immigrants. This has serious implications in the long-term analyses of health care. For one parameter, this will mean that a considerable portion of Canada’s heath care work force will be immigrants.\n\nAs a result, meeting supply and demand will be made even more difficult where Canadians, situated in rural areas, may be required to travel to larger centers to receive this crucial service. Elsewhere, a substantial number of immigrants in Canada will call for a large labor force to serve people. This may call for diversification of heathcare centers, and even changes in roles of occupational therapists.###"}
