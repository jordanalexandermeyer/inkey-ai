{"prompt": "Explain the problems, both personal and societal, that result from obesity.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A single overweight person might not warrant much attention. But a nation whose population is increasingly obese is cause for concern. In the United States, 14% of children and teenagers are categorized as overweight. Why is this a serious problem instead of simply a matter of personal choice? What are the causes of this constantly increasing percentage of obese persons? What is to be done about this, and what organized steps should be taken to solve the problem?\n\nJust as there are ripples from a stone thrown into the water, there are farreaching and unending effects resulting from obesity. From a psychological perspective, most obese persons would prefer not to be overweight. Our society glorifies the ultra-thin, so if you are obese you do not fit in with acceptable modes of appearance. We know that children are often cruel about taunting their heavy classmates. All too often we hear friends say, “I’ve got to lose weight before that trip,” or “before the wedding.” However, there are more objective measures of the negative results of obesity. Type 2 (adult onset) diabetes, an illness with serious consequences, including damage to the heart, damage to the eyes and difficulty in healing infections is attributed to obesity. Public health agencies are dealing with the continual rise in this type of diabetes. Asthma is also on the rise as a result of the obesity epidemic as are sleep disorders such as sleep apnea. Recent research indicates a relationship between some types of cancer and obesity. Society pays the price when citizens are ill, are unable to work, and require constant medical care.\n\nQuestions arise: “What can be done about this?” “Who or what is to blame?” Discussing blame is a delicate problem. There are undoubtedly overweight individuals with inherited tendencies toward diabetes or heart disease, and there is evidence that a hormone that gives people a sense of fullness after eating may be lacking in some obese people. Yet, knowing that they are at risk would suggest that steps be taken to thwart the onset of the physical consequences of obesity.\n\nMost authorities agree that diet is key. The avoidance of foods high in sugars, carbohydrates, and saturated fats is recommended by most physicians as a way to ward off obesity and its dire consequences. But this is difficult in our society where fast food outlets are ubiquitous, where we are bombarded by advertising of unhealthy foods, and where we lead increasingly sedentary lives. Sugar-laden soft drinks are sold in schools and profits from these sales are high. An elementary school in Los Angeles received $50,000 for allowing Coca-Cola to install its vending machines. This company and Pepsico constitute the majority of the school soft drink market, and while they profit from the present sales, they are also building brand loyalty and creating future habitual soft drink consumers.\n\nLack of adequate exercise is a concomitant contributor to the rise in obesity. Children are often playing video games instead of engaging in sports. Adults watch television instead of exercising. People will drive around shopping centers to avoid walking a few extra steps. The quintessential “couch potato” invention has just been invented. Now you can get a universal remote with which, from your comfortable couch, you can not only control your television, but your oven, lights and, presumably, other things which we can only begin to imagine.\n\nSociety suffers when its population is increasingly unhealthy, has rising medical costs, notes absenteeism from work and school, and has social inequalities. This latter result, social inequalities, reflects the assertion recently made by a school administrator that 50% of children in poorer school districts are obese. Experts seem to believe that obesity is a problem that can, with diligence and desire, be eliminated or at least mitigated with two simple changes in lifestyle—eating more healthily and getting more exercise.###"}
{"prompt": "Describe the purposes of the Internet. Include various viewpoints, including that of users and providers.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In today’s world, the first place people turn to when there is a question to be answered, information to be located, or people to be contacted, is often the Internet. Yes, the Internet may have supplanted the traditional encyclopedia as well as a number of other sources of service and information. We can make reservations, plan vacations, play interactive games, learn a language, listen to music or radio programs, read the newspaper, and find out about a medical condition, without coming face to face with another person. There is no limit to the subject matter you can research on the Internet. Just go to a search engine such as Yahoo or Google, type in a few key words or a Web address, and presto, you will probably summon links to more sources than you could have imagined. The Internet allows you to remain at your computer and shop no matter what you wish to purchase. And if you are looking for a bargain or an unusual item, you can go to a popular auction site and either sell or buy.\n\nIf, however, you do wish to speak directly to a person, there are the chat rooms. On practically any given topic, groups of people converse with each other. They may be giving opinions about a perfect travel itinerary, a book, or even a political party. The most prevalent use of the Internet also involves directly writing to a person, and that is the sending of e-mail messages to friends and associates. It is possible to communicate instantly with anyone, anywhere, as long as there is an Internet connection. In a world where people frequently travel, where families do not necessarily live in the same neighborhoods, e-mail is a means of making simple, inexpensive, immediate contact. Not only do we send verbal messages, but also now digital cameras take pictures that can be stored and then instantly transmitted on the Internet.\n\nUnfortunately, there are individuals who subvert the opportunities offered by this technology. They are less than honest, disguise their identity, bilk people in financial scams, and entice unsuspecting people, including children, into giving them personal information. Caveats about these problems are currently being publicized so those Internet users will not be victimized.\n\nOf course, the Internet providers, such as AOL, hope to make a profit, and there is usually a monthly fee for the hookup. To increase the profits, the providers sell advertising, which may pop up on the subscriber’s screen and require the user to stop and respond, either positively or negatively, to the ads.\n\nWhen you consider that, among other things, you can hear a concert, read a book, visit a museum and view its contents, visit the websites of numerous individuals and organizations, play a game with one or more people, and pay your bills, you will realize that the uses of the Internet are too vast for a short list. Most would agree that much has been added to peoples’ lives by connecting them to the Internet, and that we probably cannot anticipate what new purposes will be explored in the future.###"}
{"prompt": "Describe various styles of shoes as well as reasons for their popularity.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " ###"}
{"prompt": "Visit the shoe department of a large department store and you will undoubtedly see a variety of shoe styles on display. This suggests that the store is satisfying the customers’ desire for an assortment of shoes.\n\nLogically, shoes should protect and support the feet. An example of such a shoe is the sneaker. Originally an inexpensive canvas, rubber soled version of a leather oxford (a shoe with laces), the sneaker has become increasing popular and has supplanted the oxford for regular everyday use for many students and some adults. Sneakers, like living things, have evolved and branched out. They are now mostly made of leather and have much cushioning to minimize stress on the wearer’s joints. They have become specialized into separate sneakers for walking, running, tennis, and basketball. There are sneakers for aerobic classes, and for the eclectic exerciser, there are cross trainers. There is justification for their popularity for they are comfortable and are engineered to properly support the foot during a particular activity. It has also become acceptable to wear sneakers with street clothes because they just plain feel good. An endorsement by a popular athlete spreads their appeal as well as increases their cost.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum is a shoe style that is uncomfortable, harmful, and impractical. These adjectives describe the women’s shoes with pointed toes and thin, high heels. Doctors say that the pointed toes cause deformities of the feet, and the three to four inch heels are unstable and can cause back problems. With so many negatives, why are these styles consistently popular? Wearers may admit that they are uncomfortable, but say that they are fashionable and that, in time, they get used to them. Historically, people follow fashion, and here again, advertising preys upon this need to keep up with the current trends.\n\nA shoe that can be totally practical, simply fashionable, or a combination of both, is the boot. For cold or inclement weather, no footwear is as desirable as an insulated, rubber-soled boot. Boots are popular because they are practical, long lasting, and a desirable fashion accessory. But there are boots whose entire function is fashion. Yes, these boots have the same pointed toes and spiked heels as the shoes described above, but they are boots because the leather continues high on the leg.\n\nHistorically, shoe styles change, but there are some shoes that are comfortable as well as fashionable, like sandals and sneakers. And, there are those styles some would consider fashionable but harmful to the feet, or worse. If the choice were between comfort or fashion, many people would probably risk discomfort in order to be fashionable.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " ###"}
{"prompt": "Math is a required subject. Explain why it is so important.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If you complain about the universality of math as a required subject, just try and spend one day without encountering some form of mathematics. From page numbers to prices to today’s date, math puts things in order and enables us to compare quantitatively. Figuring how much time is required, how much of an ingredient must be measured, how much carpet to buy, all of these everyday experiences require familiarity with math. To survive financially you must use math to allocate your resources. If you want to invest in a business or in the stock market you must know how to deal with the numbers. Understanding graphs and other analyses about the economy or politics or consumer confidence are enhanced by the applications of math. Mathematical applications in the study of science are essential. Tracking the orbits of planets and the locations of stars in the galaxy cannot be done without numerical comparisons. Every discipline, from archeology to zoology, benefits in some way from the use of mathematics.\n\nPractical reasons for the need for mathematics are omnipresent, but there are other, perhaps more esoteric reasons, for interest in this subject. The amazing coincidences found in numbers provide continual fascination. An example is the fact that the sum of the numbers in the products of the “9-times table” add up to nine. Nine times five equals forty-five, and four plus five equals nine. Similarly, the numbers in the product of seven times nine also equal nine. Mathematicians are also especially fascinated with unique geometric relationships. An example is the fact that three pyramids of the same height will exactly fit into a prism of equal height.\n\nA teacher of mathematics once told me, “Math is in everything,” and some people say, “Mathematics is the something for which the world was written.” These are reasons enough for requiring its study.###"}
{"prompt": "Describe a major environmental problem and what you believe should be done about it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A major environmental problem, the magnitude of which we are just beginning to realize, is global warming. When people say that the winters aren’t as cold as they used to be, or that there was definitely more snow in past years, they are correct. In addition to these personal testimonials, there is concrete visual evidence of global warming. Most noticeable is the depletion of the ice caps. In recent years, glaciers have been receding in greater amounts than in former years. One only has to visit a national park where this recession is marked with signs indicating where the glacier reached in a particular year. The visitor can see how much further away from a particular spot the ice is at the present moment.\n\nWhen the ice caps, made of fresh water, melt, they change the salinity of the oceans, change the currents, and change the conditions for survival for myriad species. Additionally, invasive species might move in, affecting the entire ecosystem. This has a domino effect, as all species are interdependent and survive according to predictable sources of food and living conditions. A specific example recently described on an environmental calendar told of the effect of global warming on polar bears. The bears cannot go out on the melted ice, which is how they get their food. This causes them to lose body fat and even to be unable to give birth to cubs.\n\nGlobal warming causes flooding, and because the warming of the earth causes dryness, fires increase.\n\nWhen speaking of the causes of global warming, some experts say that ice ages followed by warming have been cyclical throughout the eons and that there is not much that can be done about it. However, most scientists believe that the actions of humans have speeded up this process. They blame the increased burning of wood and fossil fuels—oil and coal—on an increasing population needing heat for warmth and cooking. More energy consumption places carbon dioxide and other pollutants in the atmosphere. Warm air trapped around the earth has been deemed the greenhouse effect.\n\nWhile we cannot stop the naturally occurring climate changes, we can try to mitigate the rapid warming by reducing our use of fossil fuels. Much publicity has been given to the love that Americans have for sports utility vehicles which burn an inordinate amount of fuel and which are not required for the kind of ordinary driving done by most owners. There are numerous additional ways in which we can reduce our dependence on these fuels, ranging from insulating our homes, to lowering the thermostat in winter, and raising it when we use air conditioning. Perhaps researchers can develop alternate sources of energy. Presently an automobile is being developed that uses gas initially and then automatically switches to electricity. Theoretically, this car will be able to run for fifty miles on one gallon of gasoline. Additionally, we can support the scientific study of the effects of global warming. Perhaps we can predict such things as where floods will occur or where crops will have difficulty surviving and take steps to overcome these problems.\n\nOne thing is certain. Global warming is a serious environmental problem with ramifications that affect almost every aspect of life.###"}
{"prompt": "Describe how communication has changed in the last twenty years.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Who could have predicted twenty years ago that communication would change as radically as it has? Today, communication is instantaneous. No longer do we have to use a pen, pencil, or typewriter to write a letter. No longer do we have to use a postal service to mail it. No longer do we have to wait for a response that takes several days. Nor do we have to stay near a telephone or search for a public phone while traveling. Things have speeded up exponentially.\n\nIn the last twenty years we have benefited from tremendous changes in telecommunication. The relatively simple change to portable phones enabled us to roam around the house while chatting, not limited by the length of the cord that attaches the receiver to the base of the telephone. Then came the beeper, allowing us to get a message when away from a telephone. Now, of course, there is the ubiquitous cell phone. Watch the crowds walking along a sidewalk, and you can’t help noticing people purposefully striding along while talking on their cell phones.\n\nWhat if we must write a message? We now have e-mail. We send these messages immediately after typing them on the computer keyboard and never have to go to the Post Office. No more “snail mail.” Perhaps we have a written copy that must be sent but cannot be conveniently sent via the computer. Simply dial a phone number, push a few buttons, send a FAX. The copy is transmitted to the receiver at once. The ability to telecommute is almost like handing the copy to the recipient. What a difference twenty years has made. Just as most of us could not imagine the speed and ease of communication in the twenty-first century, we probably cannot anticipate the changes that will occur in the next twenty years. Perhaps we will be able to send instant messages simply by thinking about them, from one brain to the brain of the intended recipient.###"}
{"prompt": "Discuss the events in the life of your favorite author, sports figure, or performer. Explain how these events relate to the person’s achievements.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Herman Melville was a 19th century writer whose works foreshadowed themes that would become prevalent in the 20th century. He wrote about his distaste for the prevalent oppression of underlings, of the need to accept different cultures and to appreciate the contributions of ordinary people. His novels probe into psychological reasons for characters’ actions in a way that would be relevant today.\n\nBorn into a New York family that was prominent, although in constant debt, Melville was forced to end his formal schooling at the age of twelve. He was nevertheless widely read and informed on numerous subjects, including, but not limited to, literature, art, science, biology, navigation, mythology, and geography. Thus, he was largely self-educated, as was Ishmael, the narrator of Moby Dick, Melville’s most acclaimed novel. Ishmael said, “A whale ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.”\n\nJust as Ishmael’s experiential education mirrored Melville’s own informal schooling, so were many other aspects of his life reflected in his writings. Signing up as a cabin boy on a ship going to Liverpool, England, when he was 20, provided Melville with material for the novel, Redburn. The novel was about a lonely 20-year old orphan wandering around Liverpool and is thought to be the writer’s most autobiographical.\n\nMotivated by the need to earn money, Melville signed up for a four-year voyage as a common seaman in spite of the fact that his family connections could have easily gotten him an officer’s commission. Melville had a progressive view about equality that was unusual for his time. He believed in the dignity of all work, which was reflected in his sympathetic, even admiring, excruciatingly detailed, descriptions of the jobs of the working people in his writings. He decried nationalistic prejudice and believed that all people are related. He wrote, “You cannot shed a drop of American blood without shedding blood of the whole world.”\n\nAmong the first white men to explore the South Sea Islands, Melville was surely the first literary artist to do so. Unable to bear the inhumane treatment on this long voyage, he deserted in the Marquesas Islands. He was ill and fortunately was cared for by a kindly native family. A grown son in the family was covered with tattoos, and Melville learned that these people were cannibals who feasted on their enemies. In order to leave, he had to escape, finding refuge on an Australian ship. He deserted from this ship also, landing in Tahiti. These experiences provided material for the novel Typee, about the South Sea Islands, the novel Omoo, based upon his experiences in Tahiti, and the novel White Jacket, which exposed the cruelty of navy flogging. The tattooed man who cared for Melville provided the prototype for Quequeg, one of the most memorable characters in literature.\n\nHerman Melville also was a crewmember of a whaling voyage where he learned the intricacies involved in this type of multi-year voyage that he used as the setting for Moby Dick. This novel, considered a literary masterpiece, provided a forum for Melville’s ideas about the necessity for connectedness. The savage, Quequeg, and the sailor, Ishmael, were mutually supportive of this theme. In addition, Melville was a great believer in democracy and the benefits of diversity, and these beliefs were reflected in his descriptions of the crew on the whaling voyage. The ship was a metaphor for the world, with its crew coming from every known location and background, all being necessary for success. A monomaniacal captain, devoid of empathy, driven by his selfish aims, and unable to connect with others, could only lead to disaster.\n\nThus, Herman Melville’s real-life experiences undoubtedly made possible his descriptive novels, but they would not have been possible without his independently drawn conclusions about the dignity of man and his place in the universe.###"}
{"prompt": "Explain the causes and effects of not voting in elections.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Voting is the privilege for which wars have been fought, protests have been organized, and editorials have been written. “No taxation without representation,” was a battle cry of the American Revolution. Women struggled for suffrage as did all minorities. Eighteen year olds clamored for the right to vote, saying that if they were old enough to go to war, they should be allowed to vote. Yet Americans have a deplorable voting history.\n\nInterviewing people about their voting habits is revealing. There are individuals who state, almost boastfully, that they have never voted. They somehow set themselves apart from the requirements of citizenship in a democracy. Many who avoid voting do so consciously. It is not as if they were ill or unavoidably detained on election day. Often they claim that their one vote doesn’t matter. “What’s one vote?” they ask. Perhaps one vote may not count in some elections, although there have been results determined by one or very few votes. In addition, the total of single votes that are not cast can add up to a significant difference in a particular race. Some people blame the fact that they do not know enough about the issues for their absence from the voting booth. Others say that they avoid learning about the news because it is too depressing. In a democracy, we can express our opinions to our elected leaders, but more than half of us sometimes avoid choosing these people who make the policies that affect our lives.\n\nOne of the effects of this statistic is that politicians will cater to the groups that do vote in large numbers, giving more weight to their needs than to those of other groups or of the general population. Since so many do not vote, elected officials can, with impunity, promote policies that benefit the special interests that contribute financially to the election campaigns. Another effect of not voting is the free rein given to those in office to disregard the expressed opinions of constituents. For if you do not vote, why should the candidate worry about you?\n\nIt seems ironic that in this most democratic of societies, we abrogate the privilege for which so many have struggled. How many countries do not have a choice of candidates, yet their citizens are forced to participate in sham elections? In the United States we have choices. We can vote to fire an officeholder who does not live up to our expectations by choosing an opponent at the next election, and we are free to choose someone whose ideas appeal to us.\n\nPerhaps a major reason for not voting is the failure to convey how precious and unique is the right to vote and how important is each and every vote. The major effect is that we are voluntarily giving up our rights as citizens to ascertain that our elected officials truly represent us. This is because we have not done our part in choosing them so in effect, we are telling these officials that we don’t care enough to bother to vote.###"}
{"prompt": "Explain how to have a winning baseball team.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Whether professional or amateur, a baseball team, like a fine meal, needs the right ingredients to create a winning result. Talented athletes are the first requirement. After that, astute coaching, which discerns and then develops the unique capabilities of the players, can be as important as the athletes themselves. Flexibility and the willingness to try different strategies are the hallmarks of winning coaches. All the talent in the world could be wasted without creative and shrewd coaching.\n\nA player with the ability to sprint, needed both for infield defense and for speedy base running, can be invaluable. A fast runner can steal bases and get to first base with a carefully placed bunt.\n\nGood pitching is essential for a winning baseball team. A pitcher who is “on” is the first line of defense in baseball. It is well known that the pitcher is often the poorest hitter, but it is the pitcher who keeps the opponents from scoring. The pitcher’s teammates accept this and acknowledge that it is their job to score the runs. Here again, a good coach decides who is the optimum pitcher for today’s game, and equally important, when to take a tired or poorly performing pitcher out of the game.\n\nRecruiting strong and consistent batters will be a factor in creating a winning baseball team. Having a home run hitter with several players who can be counted on to get base hits and pinch hits are needed because the best pitching and the best fielding will be for naught if runs aren’t scored.\n\nEven with a plethora of natural ability, to become a winning baseball team, the players must continually practice, not only to maintain their skills, but also to improve them. In fact, a motivated player who practices diligently may eventually surpass those with superior natural ability that is not developed. Along with this desire to continually improve one’s individual playing ability, there is the motivation to succeed because of loyalty to the group. This type of esprit de corps can make the difference between a good and a winning baseball team. Putting the team first, while striving to give one’s all, puts the finishing touches on the recipe \n\nA winning baseball team would need good hitters, fast runners, a skilled pitcher and catcher, and a knowledgable and patient coach. It would also need to have a group of players who got along without any jealousy or hostility and were capable of rooting for each other.\n\nGood hitters and runners are important because you have to get alot of hits and runs to win. You can’t win without scoring runs. Also, the runners need to be speedy, so they can get to the base before the ball gets there. You also have to have a skilled pitcher who can strike people out. The pitcher has to be good or else the other team will score more runs and you will lose. The catcher is important as well because if the catcher drops the ball when the pitcher throws it, that is an error.\n\nFinally, you also need to have a good coach who can help the players improve and who knows when to put certain players in the game and when to take them out. The coach should keep the team running smoothly and solve any fights or disagreements.###"}
{"prompt": "Explain how to choose the right college.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " One of the most important decisions young adults make is where to go to school. Your college education will affect the rest of your life, so you should weigh your options carefully. The “perfect” school may not exist, but I believe there are three factors that are integral to choosing the right college: location, size, and curriculum. You can narrow down your search based on these criteria.\n\nFirst, you should consider location. Some questions you should ask yourself include: Do I prefer to live in a city, the suburbs, or a rural area? Do I want to live in a temperate or colder climate? Do I prefer to be near my family, or in another part of the country? The answers to these questions will help you make the best choice.\n\nSecond, you should consider size. Perhaps your high school experience will affect your choice of colleges. If you attended a small high school with a low teacher-student ratio, you may be accustomed to small class sizes and knowing your fellow students extremely well. On the other hand, if you attended a large high school, you may be used to new faces and larger classes. Would you prefer a school such as UCSB with 50,000 students, or a smaller school with fewer than 5,000 students? Remember, the attention you receive will be affected by the size of the student population.\n\nFinally, in order to choose the right college, you should take the time to decide what you would like to study. Although most colleges offer a myriad of courses, some schools specialize in certain fields and subjects or offer a wider selection of classes. For example, if you are interested in studying the Classics, did you know that the University of Texas has one of the best Classics departments in the United States?\n\nChoosing the right college will require some effort. After you have decided the location, size, and curriculum you prefer, do some research. Learn about different colleges from your guidance counselor, the Internet, or from the colleges themselves. As with any important decision, make sure your choice is an educated one.###"}
{"prompt": "Your new job requires that you move to a different city. Describe the steps you will take to prepare for this move.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Although Americans move more than most people in the world, a move is acknowledged to be one of life’s more stressful experiences. There are, however, steps that can be taken and preparations that can be made which will mitigate the inevitable strain.\n\nIf I were to move to a different city because of a job change, I would find a sponsor in the new location, preferably someone who could give me insight into the kind of situation I could expect at the workplace and about the cultural and other differences in the new community. Different cities may be diverse in many ways: in ideas about appropriate behavior, in social expectations, and even in emotional reactions. If the city had special sites or events to generate civic pride, I would like to investigate those. Or there may be popular gathering places such as parks or cafés. This knowledge would be helpful in getting to understand the attitudes of the residents and to become part of the community.\n\nSpending time with a realtor would be a necessity, not only for finding a satisfactory residence, but also for gaining information about different neighborhoods, schools, libraries, and other community resources. In fact, it would be worthwhile to take the time to deliberately explore the community by walking or driving around.\n\nMy family members are interested in horses, sailing, and playing bridge. As a way to find out how we can pursue these interests and find people similarly inclined, we could visit stables, marinas, or social clubs. Striking up a conversation with people in these places and telling them that I am moving shortly would create a more knowledgeable transition. In addition to picking the brains of people, there may be published material, such as maps and guidebooks, that could be informative. The same is true of Internet sites.\n\nAll this preparation cannot eliminate the probability that leaving my friends, seeing my belongings picked up, packed, and moved to a different city, and facing new routines and new surroundings will be somewhat traumatic. However, visualizing daily life in the new city can help make the move easier and the transition smoother.###"}
{"prompt": "Many people spend a great deal of time with animals. Write about the relationships that people have with animals.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Since they were first domesticated, people have had relationships with animals that have enhanced their lives. Probably animals that were trained to hunt and to retrieve prey were among the first to become valuable to their owners. Useful animals include those used for transportation, for hauling loads, and, in recent times, to assist handicapped people. The latter are usually dogs trained to guide the blind and to care for paraplegics. Although these animals have specific functions, it is probable that a special bond inevitably arises between them and the humans they serve and this goes far beyond the dependency each has for the other.\n\nCan a relationship with an animal improve a person’s health? Many recent reports seem to suggest this possibility. Pets give us abundant and unconditional love. Always happy to see us, our pets allow us to be ourselves, to talk to them, and even to believe that they understand us. When we come home, we might feel reluctant to “talk to ourselves,” but it is perfectly all right to greet, chat, and interact with our dog, cat, bird, and even our fish. Some mental health workers are so insistent upon the beneficial influences of pets that they have an animal present during therapy sessions, claiming that this causes patients to be more relaxed and responsive. Studies have proven that relationships with animals reduce stress and actually can measurably lower blood pressure.\n\nFor people who are depressed or living alone, having a pet is not only therapeutic; it is a means of encouraging a healthier lifestyle. A pet owner must live according to a regular timetable so that the pet can be fed and cared for appropriately. For dog owners, there is an additional social benefit that accrues from having to go outdoors for a walk. Encountering other dog walkers often leads to further social interaction and, perhaps, friendship. For cat owners, there is the admiration for the cat’s characteristic independence, which makes any affection from the cat so much more meaningful. Keeping the bird feeders filled gives a sense of satisfying the needs of creatures that, in turn, delight us with their beauty and their antics.\n\nOther beneficial effects of relationships with animals continue to be discovered. A recent article suggests that kindness to people and animals may be interconnected. Role-playing that increases children’s empathy for animals helps them not only psychologically, but also physically and socially. Another discovery shows that riding horses, for reasons not completely understood, has been shown to benefit autistic children. Pet owners can now volunteer to take their pets to hospitals and nursing homes where residents seem to welcome them.\n\nIt is probable that continued research will shed additional light on what happens when people and animals form a bond. For the present, it is certain that almost anyone can benefit from the resulting security, understanding, fun, laughter, and love that come from having a pet.###"}
{"prompt": "Describe an especially memorable photo or picture.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You might think a memorable picture would have vivid color, an appealing or inspirational theme, or be something you might want to display and look at every day. That is not the case with the picture that is most memorable to me. This picture is really a large mural, painted in 1937 by the Spanish artist, Pablo Picasso, to protest the bombing of a small village in northern Spain.\n\nSurprisingly, there is no vivid red color to show the flowing blood. One must imagine this, for the mural is startlingly gray, black, and white. But there is no avoiding the horror of the images. The figures are not realistically drawn, but are cubist and abstract, and it is apparent that innocent civilians are being slaughtered. A mother screams with her mouth wide open, her head tipped back in heart-rending anguish, as she holds her dead baby. A soldier lies dead on the ground, clutching his broken sword, and three other people are shown in shock and agony. Animals, including a tortured horse and a crying bird, are also portrayed as innocent victims of a massacre. Some symbols are open to interpretation. What is the meaning of the bull, which seems simply to be observing, or of the light bulb emitting rays at the top of the mural? Does the bull symbolize brute force, and does the light bulb signify that there is hope? Yet there is no doubt that the distorted, horrible images are intended to shock the viewer. This depiction of human grief is a profound statement of the cruelty and senselessness of war. Limiting the pictures to black and white adds a funereal element to the shocking depiction of the catastrophe.\n\nThe memory of the picture cannot be forgotten; it is a metaphor for the senselessness and the horror of war. While it was painted to protest atrocities in a long ago war, it is as relevant today as the recollection of the horrors of September 11th. Perhaps it should be shown to all those who contemplate starting a war. Would it be worth it to have another Guernica?###"}

Four arguments in support of my thesis were stated and each was in turn discussed with several relevant examples given. You required only three arguments. Bibliographical citations were given in the exact format you demonstrated in class. As suggested, Internet sites were used in addition to first-person accounts and editorial material.\n\nAlthough I spent an inordinate amount of time on this project , I felt it to be most worthwhile because it was a wonderful learning experience. When I saw the grade on the paper, I looked in vain for comments or suggestions. It would be helpful to me if I understood how you arrived at this grade. Would it be possible for us to arrange a meeting, during which time you could offer hints about what you felt was lacking in my work, and, perhaps, I could hope that you might reconsider and raise my grade.\n\nThank you for your kind consideration of this request.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nYour Student###"}
{"prompt": "You want to organize a family reunion. Describe the steps you will take to contact people and to organize the event.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " My family is united genetically but not by proximity. We live in far-flung locations, including three continents and both the northern and southern hemispheres. Some of us have kept in touch while others might as well be considered MIA. It would seem close to impossible to organize a family reunion for such a peripatetic group. Yet, that is what I decided to attempt.\n\nInitially I sent e-mails to all those I regularly heard from and requested any and all addresses of other relatives to be forwarded to me. South Africa was the farthest location and was the source of some previously unknown addresses. Internet searches yielded still more. How delighted I was that there seemed to be universal interest in the project. Several people volunteered to help. We generated a list and added to it as soon as we received further information.\n\nRelatives were located in Alaska, Canada, and six states. Thus the first big hurdle was overcome: the list of potential invitees. Then, with solicited input from all concerned, it was decided to choose a location near New York, the original point of origin of the family.\n\nIt then became necessary to choose a site for the get-together and then to find accommodations for approximately fifty-five people ranging in age from under one year to eighty-five. An all-suite hotel, which agreed to charge reduced rates if a minimum number of reservations were confirmed was selected. The hotel agreed to hold rooms for us until two weeks prior to the weekend of the get-together. A list of nearby motels and bed and breakfasts was also compiled. We now had the who, where, and when, the latter being the last weekend in September when the weather was still moderate and travel not likely to be a problem. Why we were getting together seemed obvious. There was curiosity to catch up, and even to meet relatives known only by reputation.\n\nNow we came to the question of how the weekend would be organized. Since most people would be arriving on Friday, that day was to be relaxed and unstructured. On Saturday, there would be games and an informal picnic lunch in a nearby county park, the permission for which was easily obtained. Saturday night would be the highlight, a catered dinner in a restaurant which could easily hold a group of this size. People had been asked to bring photos and anecdotes and a list of speakers was generated. The youngest members would be introduced and those traveling great distances would be recognized. The oldest members might wish to share their reminiscences. Sunday would again be an informal day, probably punctuated with hugs, the sharing of addresses, and promises to do this again. All of the activities would be recorded on videos and a digital camera so that they could easily be forwarded via e-mail. Thus the planning for a family reunion must begin well in advance of the date. Planners must seek out addresses of the relatives, must settle on a location, a date, and, of course, a place to stay. These would vary according to the size and needs of the group. Some groups might prefer to simply chat informally while others would appreciate planned activities. Once a family has done this, a second reunion would be much easier. The addresses are known, faces can be associated with names, and an evaluation of the previous schedule can be solicited. One caveat: have alternate plans in case of bad weather.###"}
