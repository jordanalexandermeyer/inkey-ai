{"prompt": "How did the Harry Potter series become the most successful book series of all time?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The Harry Potter series, written by J.K. Rowling, is perhaps the most popular set of novels of the modern era. With seven books and many blockbuster films to its name, the series has amassed about 15 billion dollars in sales. How did this phenomenon become what it is? For those scratching their heads, the reason can be broken down into several areas: Rowling garnered a generous initial contract for her book, separate book covers were created for both teens and adults, midnight releases/promotions/pre-orders made the public more fanatic about the series, and fan blogs were rampant. In fact, these are just a few of the main reasons why the Harry Potter took off the way it did.\n\nThe first book in the series, “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone,” was rejected 12 times before it was picked up by Bloomsbury—a small publisher in England. At the time, Rowling was living on benefits as a single mother, so receiving this contract was her first step to success. However, getting a book contract does not ensure the success of a book. The story was adored by children and adults alike, and this had much to do with the popularity of the initial book and the series as a whole (Rappaport, Sarah).\n\nIn light of this, her publisher made separate covers for young readers and adults. According to BusinessInsider.com, “Adults love reading the Harry Potter books, but few want to be seen toting around a child’s book. To make it easier for adults, Bloomsbury Publishing, the British publishing house that first bought the rights to Rowling’s books, published a second version of the books with “adult” (i.e., less colorful and more boring) book covers” (Aquino, Judith). This made it easier for a full range of ages to enjoy the series. This is not an easy feat for young adult fiction.\n\nAnother factor that worked like a charm was that when the Harry Potter series became an obvious success, the publisher, and Rowling herself through her own website for the books, conducted midnight releases, special promotions, and pre-ordering to engage readers even more. According to BusinessInsider.com, “Starting with the fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, crowds of people wearing black robes, ties and round-frame glasses began showing up at bookstores for midnight release parties in 2000. Customers who feared their local bookstore would run out of copies responded by pre-ordering over 700,000 copies prior to the July 8, 2000 release date, according to Gunelius. The seventh and final book in the Harry Potter series became the fastest-selling book in history, reports The New York Times, with more than 11 million copies sold during the first 24 hours in three markets alone” (Aquino, Judith). The fandom around the books created more lucrative opportunities for the series.\n\nAlso, based on fans, blogs were created that were dedicated to the story, details, plot, characters, and much more about the series. In the beginning, Rowling did not have too much in the way of advertising, and the fans did a lot of work for her. According to HubSpot, “The fans took over and created many viral campaigns on her behalf talking about the excitement they had over upcoming releases. Harry Potter is often a trending topic on Twitter, Facebook events and page are abundant and thousands of bloggers create posts on their behalf.  These promotions are more genuine because they come from the source, the fans, instead of the person who makes a profit” (Leist, Rachel). This organic advertising propelled the Harry Potter novel series into being the most successful one ever.\n\nNow that Rowling has sold millions of copies of her Harry Potter books and has seen each one adapted into films, merchandise, fan art, and more, we can safely say that this series is a global phenomenon. Through an initial contract, advertising for both teens and adults, special releases and parties, and organic advertising from fans via the internet, Harry Potter and his universe took over as the most successful bestselling book of all time.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the various reasons why our ancestors started being bipedal beings instead of the usual four-limbed walkers?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Around six million years ago, our ancestors began to walk on two feet instead of traveling on four feet. Bipedalism, the act of moving about on two rear limbs or legs, has been seen in various species throughout evolution. Did it make those species smarter? Apparently not. However, in this essay, the task will be exploring the various reasons why our ancestors started being bipedal beings instead of the usual four-limbed walkers. The most accepted theory is that climate change prompted our early selves to stand up to see beyond the tall grass of the savanna for predators, to run away faster from attackers, and also to walk further distances easier. Another theory suggests that we initiated the process of being bipedal in order to walk between trees easier and to collect food in treetops with greater ease, such as orangutans sometimes do. And yet other theories suggest that walking on two legs came about because new hunting strategies, and also an evolutionary adaptation to dealing with African heat.\n\nGoing into detail about the dominant theory of why we became bipedal, climate seems like the most reasonable factor at this point. According to the BBC, “Bipedalism made more sense in an environment where trees were rare. Standing up allows you to see over long grass to scan for predators and prey. The ancestral humans who were best at standing would have been more likely to survive and pass on their genes, so it is easy to imagine how natural selection could have resulted in a gradual shift from simply standing up briefly to permanently moving around in an upright posture” (Gray, Richard). However, this theory has issues, as the climate changed dramatically in Africa over the course of eons. Though savannas were created, they sometimes reverted back into forested areas. It is possible that our ancestors started to walk on two legs and never looked back, despite climate change transforming the landscape over time again into a lush forest and back into a savanna.\n\nAnother theory posits that we started to walk on two legs in trees, much like our cousins, the orangutan. According to a report called Origin of Human Bipedalism As an Adaptation for Locomotion on Flexible Branches, “Orangutans react to branch flexibility like humans running on springy tracks, by increasing knee and hip extension, whereas all other primatesdothe reverse. Human bipedalism is thus less an innovation than an exploitation of a locomotor behavior retained from the common great ape ancestor” (Thorpe, S. K. S., et al.). So, this theory says that being bipedal is a much more ancient practice than we commonly think, and that its use started due to our ancestors vying for more ways to gather food and to traverse the forest canopy.\n\nThough our ancestors did not start hunting with weapons until much after we started to walk on two feet, some researchers say that is one of the main reasons we took to being bipedal more readily. Though this theory was adopted by Charles Darwin initially, it has been proved to be a probable part of the process of humans becoming bipedal. For sure, standing and walking on two feet lends itself to more flexibility and ability to throw weapons at predators or prey (Gray, Richard).\n\nFinally, some theories point to adapting to heat as one of the reasons we started to walk on our hind legs. Stated by a report named Human locomotion and heat loss: an evolutionary perspective, “…because bipedal hominins are necessarily slow runners, early hominins in open habitats likely benefited from improved abilities to dump heat in order to forage safely during times of peak heat when predators were unable to hunt them. Endurance running capabilities evolved later, probably as adaptations for scavenging and then hunting. If so, then there would have been strong selection for heat-loss mechanisms, especially sweating, to persistence hunt, in which hunters combine endurance running and tracking to drive their prey into hyperthermia” (Lieberman, D.E.). Thus, our ancient ancestors developed mechanisms to reduce physical heat to survive and perform tasks more efficiently.\n\nLooking at all of these reasons, it is not difficult to assume that it was perhaps a combination of these factors that made our prehistoric selves stand upright. Besides climate change, wanting to traverse treetops with greater ease, new hunting strategies, and heat adaptation, there might be numerous other major reasons to consider. We may never know for sure, but we do know that becoming bipedal aided us in evolving into who we are today.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the common causes of snoring?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Snoring is a natural thing humans and animals do. It can be annoying to sleep around people who snore. Often, people say it is the bane of their existence to hear their husband, lover, or what have you snore throughout the night, ending up with insomnia. That is why many people search on Google, “Why do people snore?” In fact, it is one of the most asked questions on the internet. The common causes of snoring is age, weight, basic biology of the sexes, nasal and sinus issues, taking certain substances (alcohol, smoking, particular medications), and the position of sleep. So, in the following paragraphs, we will get to the bottom of these causes.\n\nLet us start with age. Growing older has certain effects on the body, and one of them is the greater chance of snoring. According to HelpGuide.org, “As you reach middle age and beyond, your throat becomes narrower, and the muscle tone in your throat decreases. While you can’t do anything about growing older, lifestyle changes, new bedtime routines, and throat exercises can all help to prevent snoring” (“How to Stop Snoring”). So, snoring more is inevitable with age, but we can do certain actions to cancel some of the effects of this process.\n\nWeight is another factor in snoring more. Also, being out of shape in general can contribute to this issue. As stated by Sleep.org, “Other factors can contribute; the most common is that there’s too much tissue in the throat and nasal areas. That’s why weight gain is often connected to snoring—many people who never snored in the past will begin to do so when they put on a few pounds. Gaining weight can add to the weight of your neck, which presses down on the throat during sleep” (“What Causes People to Snore”). That means if you pass a certain threshold in your body weight, the chances of snoring increases.\n\nIt is also a well-known fact that men snore more than women. This is due to basic biology. According to HelpGuide.org, “Men have narrower air passages than women and are more likely to snore. A narrow throat, a cleft palate, enlarged adenoids, and other physical attributes that contribute to snoring are often hereditary” (“How to Stop Snoring”). So, it is an inescapable fact that if you are man, due to your biology, you are more likely to snore. In fact, women make up only a third of all snorers (Frank, Christina).\n\nAnother common cause of snoring is nasal or sinus issues.  These problems can range from colds to more serious illnesses. According to HelpGuide.org, “Blocked airways or a stuffy nose makes inhalation difficult and creates a vacuum in the throat, leading to snoring” (“How to Stop Snoring”). However, most of these issues can be easily solved with medication and other treatments.\n\nIn addition, certain substances like alcohol and the smoke of cigarettes causes us to snore more. That is why you may have noticed that you snore more after a night of partying. Anyway, according to WebMD, “Alcohol and sedatives reduce the resting tone of the muscles in the back of your throat, making it more likely you’ll snore. “Drinking alcohol four to five hours before sleeping makes snoring worse,” [Sudhansu] Chokroverty says. “People who don’t normally snore will snore after drinking alcohol”’ (Melone, Linda). So, it is best to avoid these substances if you want your partner to feel comfortable sleeping next to you.\nFinally, the position in which we sleep can affect our chances of snoring. As stated by WebMD, “Lying on your back makes the base of your tongue and soft palate collapse to the back wall of your throat, causing a vibrating sound during sleep. Sleeping on your side may help prevent this” (Melone, Linda). This is a simple trick to avoid snoring if you do not have respiratory issues.\n\nTo look back at what we discovered, snoring is caused by multiple factors: how old we are, our weight, our basic biology, our nasal and sinus issues, our consumption of substances (alcohol, smoking, some medications), and our sleeping position. Keeping these all in mind, we can reduce, if not eliminate, our snoring.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the main causes of Brexit?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The word itself, “Brexit” is a mix of the words “Britain” and ‘exit.” It signifies Britain leaving the European Union. You have heard about it the news, and the word floats around in social circles. However, how much do you know about Brexit besides England trying to break off with the European Union? If one is not living in England, it can be difficult to keep up with all the news about this momentous occurrence. In addition, what are the causes of Brexit? The main causes of Brexit is the weakening of the EU, the sense of national identity in Britain, and the EU’s relationship with China.\n\nThe EU is not as strong as it used to be economically and also in terms of morale. In addition, with the inclusion of 28 members, decision-making is extremely complex. According to the Barcelona Centre of International Affairs, “The EU of 2016 by contrast has been hit by a series of extremely damaging blows: the economic crisis of 2008; the self-inflicted damage from failure to deal with the flaws of the euro following the crisis; Russian success in upsetting the post-cold war balance of power in Europe; terrorist attacks from ISIS and immense migration flows into the Union” (“Brexit: Causes and Consequences”). The UK joined the EU in 1973 to be a part of a dynamic entity that would aid nations in trade and social regulation. But now the EU is burdened with issues that are deemed to weigh down the UK.\n\nFurthemore, Britain often considers itself as an unconquered nation and is noted as a longstanding parliamentary democracy. British people have largely been more identified with being British than European. As stated by the Barcelona Centre of International Affairs, “It joined in 1973, rather because there did not seem to be any other option than joining the then more prosperous Western European democracies. It is also true that for decades, the British political class and media played an anti-EU game, where made up stories on the horrors of the EU were plastered across the front pages of tabloid newspapers. The drip drip effect of forty years of negative media coverage was difficult to reverse in a four month referendum campaign” (“Brexit: Causes and Consequences”). This sense of identity also is being challenged by the EU’s policy on immigration. Common people in Britain in the majority do not feel inclined to open immigration. According to Ian Jack of The Guardian, “…in 2004, Tony Blair’s government decided to open the UK labour market to the eight eastern and central European countries that had joined the EU. Between 5,000 and 13,000 migrants were expected; within the first year, 129,000 turned up. Blair and other senior Labour figures later conceded they had made a mistake” (“Who Do I Blame? Eight Reasons We Ended up in This Brexit Mess”). This political decision made waves across the populace about the sentiment towards immigrant workers. Now, like in many European countries, Britain’s nationalism is on the rise because of the so-called unwarranted amount of immigrants.\n\nLastly, a main cause of Brexit is the UK’s dislike of how the EU has treated China and how globalization has affected UK markets. Though China has joined the World Trade Organization, it has not complied with its rules. According to the Barcelona Centre of International Affairs, “The failure of the EU to recognise and deal with Chinese unwillingness to comply with WTO standards and apply robust trade defence measures in response has had a damaging effect on industrial employment across Europe” (“Brexit: Causes and Consequences”). Furthermore, many argue that immigration is not the primary cause of Brexit, but policies on economic globalization are. Increasingly, the British production of goods have been shifted overseas—especially to China. The Washington Post states that, “…governments’ inability to compensate globalization’s losers seems to have pushed voters toward political entrepreneurs who cast themselves as isolationist and nationalist, and who blame immigrants for woes that probably have little, if anything, to do with immigration” (Colantone, Italo, and Piero Stanig). The issue is complicated, but it boils down to British businesses having a difficult time keeping up with the effects of globalization within their industries.\n\nWhen the vote was finalized for Brexit, it was a shock to the world. But to the people who were affected by the EU’s policies for decades, it was not so much of a surprise. The main causes of Brexit is the EU’s diminished economy, the strength of the national identity in Britain, and the effects of globalization on markets in the UK.###"}
{"prompt": "How has television transformed our lives?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " TV, or television, has transformed our lives dramatically since it was first introduced in 1954. It especially took off in 1962, when color television came to the public. It seems that the world never was the same after TV was shown to the world. It has prompted us to stay indoors more, has changed how we operate political campaigns, caused family interactions to decrease, and made obesity skyrocket, among other effects.\n\nMore than ever before, people—especially children—have been staying indoors. This is largely due to the access to TV and other pieces of technology. According to The Guardian, there has been a study by the National Trust, and the findings were that “…on average, children were playing outside for just over four hours a week, compared to 8.2 hours a week when the adults questioned were children” (“Children Spend Only Half as Much Time Playing Outside as Their Parents Did”). This leads to many damaging effects to our body and mental state.\n\nOn a more grandiose scale, TV has affected the way we go about political campaigns. The Kennedy-Nixon election of 1959 is a case in point, with the first ever US presidential debate broadcast on TV. The result was Kennedy winning over Nixon in the polls after the broadcast despite being down in numbers before. According to HowStuffWorks, “Television gave elected officials and candidates for office an unprecedented way to speak directly to millions, face-to-face. Of course, it didn’t take long for that direct contact to be mediated, mostly by the network executives, producers and reporters who put together nightly news programs. Trends like sound bites, talking heads and the dramatic nature of television news coverage have led critics to accuse TV of creating a less factual, more negative form of political coverage” (Sailor, Matt). With the advent of TV, voting has decreased and voters have become more negative towards the political process.\n\nAnother negative effect of TV in our lives is the way they make children and parents interact less. Often, parents see TV has a form of parenting, and also as a form of bonding (though this type of bonding is very low on the spectrum of interaction). Science Daily states that, “Since the first television screens lit up our living rooms scientists have been studying its effect on young children. Now scientists in Ohio have compared mother-child communication while watching TV to reading books or playing with toys to reveal the impact on children’s development. The results, published in Human Communication Research, show that watching TV can lead to less interaction between parents and children, with a detrimental impact on literacy and language skills” (“TV Found to Have Negative Impact on Parent-Child Communication and Early Literacy Compared to Books and Toys”). So, not only are parents and children socializing less, but children’s language skills are dropping because of the introduction of TV to the masses.\n\nWith less time outdoors and less interaction, it would not be surprising to say that TV is a factor in rising obesity numbers. In fact, the amount of hours one watches TV is directly correlated to weight gain. According Rosiek, Anna et al. in their report “Effect of Television on Obesity and Excess of Weight and Consequences of Health,” “… watching TV and time spent in front of the screen are clearly associated with unhealthy dietary behaviors in children, adolescents, and adults. People who watch television more rarely, and drink less sweet drinks during the day, were characterized by lower BMI. In 2003 the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Organisation (FAO) officially reported that commercials of food products directed to children can foster the development of obesity…” (International journal of environmental research and public health). Though TV affects the obesity of all demographics, children are probably the most influenced.\n\nAs you can see, TV has had mostly a negative influence on our world. People are staying indoors more than ever, political campaigns have become more corrupt and about visuals, parents and children are interacting less than before, and obesity has shot up. This means we need to pay attention to how much TV we watch and how it is affecting our lives.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the main causes of employment?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Though employment worldwide seems to be rising, unemployment is still a serious issue. Also, there are many workers that can easily be fired and with positions that are unstable. But what are the main causes of employment? Recessions, outsourcing, low consumer demand, rising minimum wages, and criminal history are all elements that contribute to employment rates.\n\nRecessions are common in every country, including the United States of America. According to Mary Hall of Listopedia, “A recession has a domino effect, where increased unemployment leads to less growth and a drop in consumer spending, affecting businesses, which lay off workers due to losses. A recession occurs when there are two or more consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth. In other words, economic growth slows during a recession” (“Why Does Unemployment Rise during a Recession?”). Some recessions are so severe that even highly educated individuals cannot obtain jobs.\n\nRecessions can also lead to outsourcing. Stated by Chron, “…an outsourced job doesn’t get replaced by anything. The work has moved to another country. Meanwhile, these unemployed workers find themselves hard-pressed to get work in their field, because other companies are following suit and outsourcing” (Fredman, Josh). This mostly refers to foreign outsourcing, whereas domestic outsourcing can also affect wages negatively.\n\nSometimes, besides recessions and outsourcing, unemployment is caused by low consumer demand. According to economicshelp.org, “Demand deficient unemployment occurs when there is insufficient demand in the economy to maintain full employment: in a recession (a period of negative economic growth) consumers will be buying fewer goods and services; selling fewer goods, firms sell less and so reduce production; if firms are producing less, this leads to lower demand for workers – either workers are fired, or a firm cuts back on employing new workers. In the worst case scenario, the fall in demand may be so great a firm goes bankrupt, and everyone is made redundant” (Pettinger, Tejvan). As you can see, a chain reaction happens when low consumer demand takes place.\n\nAnother factor involving people is higher minimum wages. At first, having higher minimum wages sounds like a fantastic idea. However, there are some drawbacks in the workplace, and in the organization of companies in particular, that happen when a minimum wage is raised. According to Greg DePersio from Investopedia, “…minimum wages can actually raise unemployment by giving employers less incentive to hire and more incentive to automate and outsource tasks that were previously performed by low-wage employees. Higher mandated minimum wages also force businesses to raise prices to maintain desired profit margins. Higher prices can lead to less business, which means less revenue and therefore less money to hire and pay employees” (“Minimum Wages Can Raise Unemployment”). Once again, we see that chain reactions are common when it comes to causes of unemployment.\n\nAnd lastly, another cause of unemployment that is pinned on individuals are criminal records. According to the University of Pennsylvania, “The criminal justice system often takes working age men out of communities where they would normally be a household’s primary earner in mass and, when they are released, severely inhibits their ability to regain a strong footing in the labor force helps to propel the “cycle of poverty”. In fact, studies have found that in large urban centers as many as one in four black men who live in that community are incarcerated at any given time” (“Criminal Records and Unemployment: The Impact on the Economy”). But criminal records also affect all demographics—it is just that they put pressure on the African-American community disproportionately.\n\nUnemployment is not as straightforward as it seems. There are various factors that cause this phenomenon. Economic recessions, domestic and foreign outsourcing, low consumer demand, higher minimum wages, and the criminal histories of workers are factors that strongly influence unemployment. Though economies are cyclical, unemployment is still an unfortunate circumstance.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the most common effects of sleep deprivation?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A lack of sleep seems pervasive. We are sleeping less than ever before, some studies have shown. Our lives are becoming more and more busy with each passing era, and even children are suffering from sleep deprivation due to all the activities they are engaging in. In light of these issues, it is important to know the effects of a lack of sleep. The most common effects of sleep deprivation are drowsiness during the day, experiencing microsleeps, a difficulty concentrating, impulsive behavior, a difficulty learning, and lower physical immunity.\n\nDrowsiness is a noticeable effect of a lack of sleep. In fact, it is quite dangerous, as according to WebMD, “Drowsiness can slow reaction time as much as driving drunk. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that fatigue is a cause in 100,000 auto crashes and 1,550 crash-related deaths a year in the U.S. The problem is greatest among people under 25 years old” (Peri, Camille). Therefore, we have to be careful not to become sleepy during the day in order to not harm others.\n\nIn addition to regular drowsiness, we can experience microsleeps due to sleep deprivation. Once again, these occurrences are hazardous, as HealthLine states that, “During these episodes, you’ll fall asleep for a few seconds or minutes without realizing it. Microsleep is out of your control and can be extremely dangerous if you’re driving. It can also make you more prone to injury due to trips and falls” (“11 Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Your Body”). In order to avoid microsleep, you must get at least six hours of sleep a night.\n\nIn the same vein, concentration becomes more difficult with a lack of sleep. According to Healthline, “Sleep deprivation leaves your brain exhausted, so it can’t perform its duties as well. You may also find it more difficult to concentrate or learn new things. The signals your body sends may also come at a delay, decreasing your coordination skills and increasing your risks for accidents” (“11 Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Your Body”). A lack of concentration can also affect us seriously at work, where this function is often the name of the game.\n\nWith a lack of concentration can come impulsive behaviour. A study on the link between this characteristic and sleep deprivation noted that, “Patients with impulse control disorders often report sleep problems, and sleep deprivation even in healthy individuals impairs cognition, decision-making, and perhaps impulse control” (Acheson, A, et al.). In general, neglecting sleep can cause harmful, impulsive behaviour.\n\nNot only does not getting enough sleep make us impulsive, but also not as smart. According to WebMD, “Sleep plays a critical role in thinking and learning. First, it impairs attention, alertness, concentration, reasoning, and problem solving. This makes it more difficult to learn efficiently” (Peri, Camille). So, if you want to learn and have all the engines firing up there, so to speak, it is best to sleep the minimum amount to perform well mentally.\n\nSometimes people wonder why they get sick so often. The reason might be that you are not sleeping enough. In fact, sleep deprivation has been linked to acquiring sickness easier through a deficiency in immunity. According to Healthline, “Sleep deprivation prevents your immune system from building up its forces. If you don’t get enough sleep, your body may not be able to fend off invaders. It may also take you longer to recover from illness” (“11 Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Your Body”). It is also known that long-term sleep deprivation causes one to be more prone towards getting diabetes and heart disease.\n\nThere are many other effects that could be listed when speaking about how a lack of sleep affects our well-being. However, these examples are the most apparent. Ponder them the next time you want to sleep less, or you have scheduled only a short time for sleep.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the causes of insomnia?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Insomnia is more common than you think. Millions of people experience insomnia every year. Tossing, turning, not being able to shut off your brain to slip into the state of sleep—it is extremely frustrating, and unhealthy. In order to avoid getting insomnia, this essay will explore the causes of this phenomenon so you can be better prepared to prevent and to avoid this pain. The causes of insomnia involve medical conditions, depression, anxiety, lifestyle, and food.\n\nThere are many medical conditions that engender insomnia. Such conditions as sinus allergies, gastrointestinal issues such as reflux, endocrine problems like hyperthyroidism, arthritis, asthma, neurological issues such as Parkinson’s disease, chronic pain, and low-back pain cause insomnia. In addition, according to the National Sleep Foundation, “…insomnia may be a symptom of underlying sleep disorders. For example, restless legs syndrome—a neurological condition in which a person has an uncomfortable sensation of needing to move his or her legs—can lead to insomnia. Patients with restless legs syndrome typically experience worse symptoms in the later part of the day, during periods of inactivity, and in the transition from wake to sleep, which means that falling asleep and staying asleep can be difficult” (“What Causes Insomnia?”). As one can see, there are a multitude of medical conditions that cause insomnia.\n\nA cause more on the mental side, depression, is also linked to insomnia. As stated by WebMD, “Most experts agree that adults need seven to nine hours of sleep a night. But even without depression, according to the National Sleep Foundation, the average American only gets about 6.9 hours. When you add depression to the mix, the problems with sleep are compounded” (“Sleep Deprivation and Depression: What’s the Link?”). In other words, depression is not a direct cause of insomnia, but it worsens your sleep disorder.\n\nOn the note of mental conditions, anxiety is a common link with insomnia as well. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, “Anxiety causes sleeping problems, and new research suggests sleep deprivation can cause an anxiety disorder. Research also shows that some form of sleep disruption is present in nearly all psychiatric disorders. Studies also show that people with chronic insomnia are at high risk of developing an anxiety disorder” (“Sleep Disorders”). So, anxiety and insomnia are interrelated, and they are both causes of each other.\n\nGetting into more practical causes, our lifestyle can be a cause of insomnia. Working at home in the evenings, taking naps in the afternoon, sleeping in, and being a late shift worker all have repercussions, and often to lead a degree of insomnia. The worst thing to happen is to make a habit of these behaviours. As soon as they become more regular, the deeper you get into the routine of insomnia (“What Causes Insomnia?”).\n\nAnother practical cause of insomnia is the food we eat. You know the saying, “we are what we eat.” Well, this applies to sleep as well. Fried foods, coffee, alcohol, red meat, spicy foods, and too many liquids can cause us to be insomniacs. Fried foods take a lot for us to break down, and can make our body more active during the digestion process. Coffee is a more obvious cause, as the caffeine it contains can easily make us more uppidy. Alcohol is commonly used as a soother, but it disrupts our sleep cycle. We get to sleep faster with alcohol, but we will wake up often. With red meat, the digestion of such products are also difficult, so it heats up the body and puts it in overdrive. In addition, bad news for spice lovers, as spicy food can cause indigestion and stomach pain, which will keep us up. Probably the most obvious factor is the drinking of many liquids before sleep, which disrupts our sleep cycle by us having to go to the bathroom often during the night (Rountree, Alicia).\n\nOverall, insomnia is caused by multiple factors. Myriad medical conditions, clinical depression, anxiety/stress, lifestyle choices, and particular foods cause insomnia in millions of people worldwide. Knowing the causes will help you rest easier, as you know what to avoid in order to rest well.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the reasons why teenagers might try drugs?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Teenagers are renowned for being curious about the world around them and wanting to discover new activities. It is not surprising that addictive and destructive substances such as drugs would attract teengers’ attention. But why exactly do they strive to try these substances when they know it can be potentially harmful? Teenagers often try drugs due to stress, peer pressure, self-medication, misinformation, and easy access.\n\nEveryone gets stressed to some degree, but being a teenager might be the most stress-inducing time in one’s life. In order to relieve this tension, teenagers often vie for the consumption of drugs. According to the Casa Palmera Treatment Center, “A recent study by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America showed that 73 percent of teens report the number-one reason for using drugs is to deal with the pressures and stress of school. Surprisingly, only 7 percent of parents believe that teens might use drugs to cope with stress, showing parents severely underestimate the impact of stress on their teens’ decision to use drugs” (Casa Palmera). It appears that parents and teachers often do not think that teenagers can be stressed enough to be prompted to take drugs. However, research has proven otherwise.\n\nPeer pressure is more known than stress as a cause of teenagers taking drugs. It is usually thought of first between parents when trying to understand why their children consume strange substances. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, “The desire to impress your friends may override your fear of taking risks. This could also apply to deciding whether to try drugs or alcohol—your decision might be influenced by who’s around and if you think they’d be impressed” (“Why Does Peer Pressure Influence Teens To Try Drugs?”). Wanting to fit in and show off to your friends are powerful drivers when it comes to taking drugs. Teenagers strive to find a place in their society, and doing drugs is seen as an avenue to achieve that.\n\nGetting proper medical and psychiatric care for teenagers is not easy, and a lot of these individuals do not want to talk to their parents about their problems. Therefore, a lot of teenagers treat taking drugs as self-medication. According ScienceDaily, “Research shows that some teens are using drugs to alleviate feelings of depression (“self-medicating”), when in fact, using marijuana can compound the problem. The report, released to coincide with May’s Mental Health Awareness Month, shows a staggering two million teens felt depressed at some point during the past year, and depressed teens are more than twice as likely as non-depressed teens to have used marijuana during that same period. Depressed teens are also almost twice as likely to have used illicit drugs as non-depressed teens” (“Teen ‘Self Medication’ For Depression Leads To More Serious Mental Illness, New Report Reveals”). So, teenagers with depression often are faced with the choice of confronting parents about their state, or trying to self-medicate themselves through drugs. They often choose the more secretive way of dealing with their issues.\n\nIn addition to self-medicating themselves, teenagers see drugs in a brighter light than adults in general. They often do not understand or comprehend how dangerous drugs can be. According to the Casa Palmera Treatment Center, “Many teens, 41 percent to be exact, mistakenly believe that it’s safer to abuse a prescription drug than it is to use illegal drugs. Nearly 1 in 5 teens have already abused a prescription medication or prescription painkiller in order to get high or deal with stress” (Casa Palmera). This misinformation leads to an increase in the likelihood of a teenager trying harmful substances.\n\nWith marijuana and other drugs becoming easier to obtain, the rate at which teenagers can get hold of these substances is higher. According to Heath24, “Overall, teens who had alcohol and illegal drugs available to them started drinking and using drugs at a younger age, and used more alcohol and drugs in their 20s” (“Easy Access to Drugs and Booze Ups Teens’ Addiction Risk”). These statistics show a clear connection between ease of access and getting addicted to drugs.\n\nTeenagers and drugs have a close relationship because of several factors. Stress, peer pressure, self-medication, misinformation, and easy access all make drugs appealing to this demographic. The only thing we can do is properly educate teenagers on the risks of drugs and have parental figures open themselves up to these individuals in order to increase communication.###"}
{"prompt": "What were the major causes of World War I?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " World War I spanned from July, 1914 until November 11, 1918. The War caused the deaths of over 17 million people. However, telling about the causes of the first world war is not so easy. There were a multitude of reasons that the War broke out. The major causes were defense alliances, imperialism, militarism, nationalism, and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.\n\nIn 1914, there were mutual defense alliances between Russia and Serbia, Germany and Austria-Hungary, France and Russia, Britain and France and Belgium, and Japan and Britain. According to contributor Kelly Martin from ThoughtCo, “Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, Russia got involved to defend Serbia. Germany seeing Russia mobilizing, declared war on Russia. France was then drawn in against Germany and Austria-Hungary. Germany attacked France through Belgium pulling Britain into war. Then Japan entered the war. Later, Italy and the United States would enter on the side of the allies” (“The Top 5 Causes That Led to World War I”). As you can see, through mutual defense alliances, a chain reaction started that ended up in many lives lost.\n\nImperialism was rampant at the time at the time of the War, and only made the situation with the alliances worse. As stated by HistoryOnTheNet, “By 1900 the British Empire extended over five continents and France had control of large areas of Africa. With the rise of industrialism countries needed new markets. The amount of lands ‘owned’ by Britain and France increased the rivalry with Germany who had entered the scramble to acquire colonies late and only had small areas of Africa” (“World War One – Causes”). In other words, Germany wanted to keep up with British and French imperialism, and that exasperated the War.\n\nIn addition, before and during the War, many countries were in an arms race. Germany had the largest military force in the world in 1914, and England and Russia were the greatest rivals to German power. This race began to have greater and greater sway on political processes, especially public policy. This fueled the War into deeper depths of combat (Kelly, Martin).\n\nBesides the arms race, there was also a race in the pride of nations, so to say. Nationalism began to crop up more and more through the turmoil happening in Europe at the time. According to HistoryOnTheNet, “The Congress of Vienna, held after Napoleon’s exile to Elba, aimed to sort out problems in Europe. Delegates from Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia (the winning allies) decided upon a new Europe that left both Germany and Italy as divided states. Strong nationalist elements led to the re-unification of Italy in 1861 and Germany in 1871. The settlement at the end of the Franco-Prussian war left France angry at the loss of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany and keen to regain their lost territory. Large areas of both Austria-Hungary and Serbia were home to differing nationalist groups, all of whom wanted freedom from the states in which they lived” (“World War One – Causes” ). Thus, the breaking up of nations led to the development of nationalistic groups that vied for dominant positions on the world stage.\n\nA more direct cause of the War was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. A Serbian nationalist shot the Archduke of Austria on June 28th of 1914 as he was visiting imperial troops. With the help of Russia, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia almost immediately. Because of the alliances, Germany proceeded to declare war on Russia, and subsequently invaded France through Belgium. This action caused Britain to declare war on Germany. This demonstrates that a war can begin based on political ties.\n\nWorld War I was the most devastating war anyone had witnessed at the time. Through intricate defense alliances, explicit imperialism, prideful militarism, passionate nationalism, and the ghastly assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, World War I came into being. Knowing how such an atrocious war can start from these factors, one can feel fearful of our present and close future. We need to keep wary of current circumstances in order not to dive into another world war.###"}
{"prompt": "How does human activity contribute to global warming?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Earth has been heating and cooling for centuries, and this fact hardly bothers climatologists. According to NASA, Earth’s orbit fluctuates from time to time, and such a change varies the amount of solar radiation our planet receives (Climate change: How do we know?). In some respect, we can say that a kind of global warming pushed the Ice Age to its extinction. Climates never stay the same, and this has been the case for hundreds of thousands of years. But things have changed dramatically over the last century, and today we observe that warming has accelerated far beyond the limit.\n\nThe 1950s became the tipping point for environmental scientists. The average temperature on our planet has risen to about 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit since then. The level of carbon dioxide emissions became twice as large as it had been at any peak of natural heating-cooling cycles recorded before the 1950s (Climate change: How do we know?). From this time on, the temperature on the planet rose, oceans warmed, glaciers shrunk, and areas covered with snow visibly decreased. All of that change happened over some 60 years.\n\nClimate is changing at an unprecedented speed now, and few scientists dare deny that. Human activity is the most popular explanation to the phenomenon of global warming. So, how is this happening? By emitting a tremendous amount of greenhouse gas every day.\n\nSunlight always passes to the surface of our planet, and a certain part of it is reflected back to space. However, a great amount of heat is trapped in the atmosphere due to greenhouse gases. These are the notorious carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and even water vapor. All of them create a shield that keeps heat close to Earth and does not let it out into space. But what exactly do we do to release that much greenhouse gas?\n\nIndustries are the first to blame for starting global warming. The amount of CO2 has increased by more than one-third since the Second Industrial Revolution of 1880. It was the one that brought most of the technological advancements to industries. This fact builds the direct link between human activities and the carbon dioxide released. Scientists also operate with other theories of global warming and why it emerged, but the impact of new industries remains undeniable.\n\nBurning fossil fuels is a tremendous part of industrial and domestic human activities, which results in climate change. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, the greatest part of coal and oil consumption goes to transportation, the work of power plants, industrial facilities, single households, and agricultural businesses (Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions). The abundance of transport—ships, trains, and planes—made even such a gross consumer of fossil fuels as the power economy the second biggest CO2 polluter.\n\nSo, we actively burn fossil fuels, and thus create global warming. Rising temperatures make our living uncomfortable, but our everyday comfort is not the biggest problem. Hundreds of species are losing their habitats because ice caps are shrinking and the water in the ocean has become too warm for them. Polar bears, frogs, and corals are hit the hardest by global warming according to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (7 Species Hit Hard by Climate Change—Including One That’s Already Extinct).\n\nThe rise of sea levels caused by melting glaciers has already pushed out the populations of coastal species. Unfortunately, there is more harm to be done. As the ocean warms up, more powerful storms will come, and natural disasters will intensify. A rapid climate change is the direct cause of the most destructive recent natural catastrophes.\n\nNo doubt, boosting global warming is much easier than taking even a slight attempt to curb it. But we have to take action if we want to save our own natural habitat at the very least. Non-governmental organizations, like Greenpeace or the UN, constantly work on their missions that concern improving the environment. Governments around the world impose strict emission quotas on their industries, as China did in 2017.\n\nAs individuals, we can sufficiently reduce our carbon footprint if we choose to live green. It sounds complicated, but it is easy to start. Just by installing LED bulbs and pulling out the plugs you do not need, you will save a considerable amount of energy in your household monthly. In a while, you may install solar batteries or buy an electric-powered vehicle. You do not need to go entirely green in a day or week. By following these simple rules, you will realize how much your carbon imprint has reduced.\n\nBesides consuming less electricity, there are other ways for us to ease global warming.\nTurn to reusing and recycling. During your everyday shopping, dismiss buying plastic bags and take a durable cloth bag you can use for months before it wears out. Buy drinks in recyclable glass bottles you would dispose of separately.\n\nParticipate in your local recycling initiatives. It is easy to use those bins for different types of waste like glass, plastic bottles, and paper.\n\nAlso, avoid buying products with excessive packaging—and stop buying products you do not need altogether. Decreasing our consumption, we lower carbon emissions that affect the whole planet.###"}
{"prompt": "What were the main causes of the Great Depression?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Beginning in the United States, the Great Depression was a worldwide economic depression. According to data, it was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of its kind in the 20th century. It is said the Great Depression started on September 4th, 1929, through various factors. According to experts, the causes of the Great Depression was a stock market crash, bank failures, a reduction in purchasing, American economic policy in Europe, and drought conditions. Let us explore these causes in detail in the following paragraphs.\n\nThough the stock market of 1929 was crucial for the initiation of the Great Depression, it was not the only factor. According to Cumberland County Schools, “Two months after the original crash in October, stockholders had lost more than $40 billion dollars. Even though the stock market began to regain some of its losses, by the end of 1930, it just was not enough and America truly entered what is called the Great Depression” (5 Causes of The Great Depression). Though the U.S. lost a massive amount of financial power through the stock market crash, bank failures also made a huge impact on the economy.\n\nAfter the huge market crash, widespread bank failures happened. As the website “The Great Depression” states, “Economists can debate whether bank failures caused the Great Depression, or the Great Depression caused bank failures, but this much is undisputed: By 1933, 11,000 of the nation’s 25,000 banks had disappeared. Overnight, hundreds of thousands of customers began to withdraw their deposits. With no money to lend and loans going sour as businesses and farmers went belly up, the American banking crisis deepened” (“Bank Failures During The Great Depression”). President Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to tackle the Great Depression by creating a 3-day bank holiday, and from this action, 1,000 banks were saved (“Bank Failures During The Great Depression”).\n\nFrom the stock market crash and bank failures, naturally purchasing power became less. According to Cumberland County Schools, “As people lost their jobs, they were unable to keep up with paying for items they had bought through installment plans and their items were repossessed. More and more inventory began to accumulate. The unemployment rate rose above 25% which meant, of course, even less spending to help alleviate the economic situation” (5 Causes of The Great Depression). As you can see, it was like a chain reaction, with each loss creating an exponential effect. These effects even went abroad.\n\nIn 1930, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff was introduced to safeguard American companies. However, according to Cumberland County Schools, “This charged a high tax for imports thereby leading to less trade between America and foreign countries along with some economic retaliation” (5 Causes of The Great Depression). Thus, even though the Tariff allowed companies to stay afloat, overall trade between the U.S. and other nations became increasingly less.\n\nNot so much a direct cause of the Great Depression, but definitely a factor that worsened general conditions, was the Dust Bowl. As the website “The Great Depression” states, “A drought that lasted from 1930 to 1936, known as the Dust Bowl, aggravated the problems of the Great Depression. More than a million acres of farmland were rendered useless because of severe drought and years of overfarming, and hundreds of thousands of farmers joined the ranks of the unemployed” (“Causes of The Great Depression | Great Depression Facts Effects”). With agriculture being hit hard, it is no wonder the the Great Depression became even more dreadful.\n\nLooking back, we can see that the Great Depression was caused by various factors, besides just the stock market crash of 1929. There was also bank failures, a reduction in purchasing power, a worsening American economic policy in Europe, and the Dust Bowl. All these causes combined made the Great Depression what it was: the most horrendous economic collapse of the 20th century.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the causes of romantic attraction?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Sometimes, it seems we are attracted towards people romantically in an inexplicable manner. We see someone and our romantic side sparks up. However, it is not a mystery to science and people who study sociology. There are definite causes as to why people become romantically attracted to each other. These factors are sexual attraction, similarity, communication, mystery, and sincerity.\n\nSexual attraction is often the primary way people become attracted to each other. However, romantic love and sexual attraction may not always have a direct link. According to Helen Fisher, PhD, “Sexual chemistry does not always equal love, and this is because we’ve evolved distinct brain systems for mating. One system controls the craving for sexual gratification. Another system rules over romantic love – that [is] obsessive thinking, craving, and focusing on one individual. They’re not always connected, which is why you can be madly in love with someone and only have so-so sex, while you can have intensely passionate sex with someone you never want to see again!” (“Why We Love: The Nature and Chemistry of Romantic Love”). So, even though sexual attraction is a guiding force, it does not equate to strong romantic attraction.\n\nThough people often say opposites attract, similarity often connects individuals in a romantic way. In fact, based on research done by the University of Colorado Boulder, we tend to choose partners who have a similar DNA to ours (Whiteman, H.). Of course we cannot examine the DNA of others readily, but we can intuitively “feel” if people are a genetic match for us.\n\nCommunication is another essential factor in the romantic attraction equation. If we feel a deep connection to someone through the ease of talking with them, we are much more likely to be attracted to that person (Romantic Chemistry Explained). It is difficult to be romantically involved with someone you can barely communicate with. And as a side note, there are people we are not sexually attracted to, but after conversing with them for some time, we suddenly become romantically interested in them.\n\nBeing mysterious as a partner is another key. Women often say they want a mysterious man. Men are more habitual and regulated, whereas women often thrive on spontaneity. Therefore women often want their men to be more unpredictable and for them to have something to seek. If their partner is completely understood, romantic attraction to them lessens (Weinschenk, Susan). This type of preference is also backed by hormones. According to ambiancematchmaking.com, “Dopamine is also stimulated by unpredictability. When something happens that is not exactly predictable, it stimulates the dopamine system” (Romantic Chemistry Explained). So, women may be searching for a mysterious man based on hormones.\n\nFriends often connect through noticing the sincerity of others, but this also lends to romantic attraction. According to Kelly Campbell, PhD, “Chemistry occurs most often between people who are down-to-earth and sincere. This is because if a person is comfortable with themselves, they are better able to express their true self to the world, which makes it easier to get to know them, even if perspectives on important matters differed” (Psychology Today). This adds to the perspective that easy communication between people contributes to romantic attraction.\n\nThough falling in love may seem like something from outer space, there are causes behind it. Sexual attraction, similarity, an ease of communication, being mysterious, and sincerity all cause people to feel romantic attraction to each other. Usually, these causes are a mix in each romantic relationship, as not each couple attain all these facets in their partnerships.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the main factors that affect our health?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Being healthy is kind of a mysterious thing. Some people can drink alcohol all the time and smoke cigars in between and live long and relatively healthy, whereas nutrition-nut individuals always eating organic food and abstaining from habits that would be detrimental at times die early. Genetics definitely has an influence on how long we live and how well we do internally, but there are many other factors that strongly affect our health. Let us explore the general, intrinsic, and extrinsic factors that affect our well-being.\n\nTo get facts straight, the most influential factor affecting our health is our socioeconomic status (40%). After this comes, in order, health behaviors (30%), environment (10%), family genetics (10%), and finally healthcare (10%) (What Affects Our Health?). Socioeconomic status involves race, education, and poverty level. We are often born into an unhealthy status, or land into one due to economic situations. Not surprisingly, healthy habits such as exercising, good eating, and meditation reflect the second most influential factor. But it seems that many people with a low socioeconomic status cannot afford to engage in these health behaviors. Clean air, clean water, a lack of toxicity, safety, and green materials all help to maintain our health as well, reflecting the third most important factor for our health status. Maybe somewhat of a surprise, genetics is the fourth most essential factor, with predisposition playing a role. Slightly less influential is the standard of healthcare we have, which is curious to think about, since we spend enormous amounts of money on it.\n\nNext, we will get into more detail about the intrinsic and and extrinsic factors affecting our health. Intrinsic factors involve elements within our body that can possibly create diseases and other harmful processes, whereas extrinsic factors comprise aspects of the outer world that can influence our health. The main intrinsic factors are malfunctioning body parts, hereditary diseases, hormonal diseases, and allergies. In terms of extrinsic factors, we got nutritional disorders, infections by microorganisms, habit-forming substances, and environmental pollution (Shetty, Satya). I think “habit-forming substances” needs a bit more explanation. Drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana or cigarettes, sniffing glue, or hard drugs could be classified as habit-forming substances. They are usually addictive and are intertwined with popular lifestyles.\n\nWe have been mostly delving into physical health, but mentioning mental health is also key. In fact, many specialists believe our mental and physical sides are interconnected. Let us take depression. If an individual is showing signs of depression, they have a “67% increased risk of death from heart disease” and also a “50% increased risk of death from cancer” (Mental Health Foundation). With a more severe issue like schizophrenia, people with this problem “double the risk of death from heart disease” and are “three times the risk of death from respiratory disease” (Mental Health Foundation). On a more everyday level, stress can cause a large amount of emotional, physical, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. There are too many symptoms to mention here, so I will give a run down of the most essential. For emotional symptoms, we have “becoming easily agitated, frustrated, and moody, feeling overwhelmed, like you are losing control or need to take control, having difficulty relaxing and quieting your mind”; in terms of physical symptoms, we can list “low energy, headaches, upset stomach, including diarrhea, constipation, and nausea”; with cognitive symptoms, we have “constant worrying, racing thoughts, forgetfulness and disorganization”; and finally for behavioral symptoms, we can name “changes in appetite—either not eating or eating too much, procrastinating and avoiding responsibilities, increased use of alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes” (WebMD) . As you can see, stress creates a complex of damage for an individual.\n\nWhat makes one person healthy and another person unhealthy involves a multitude of factors. Socioeconomic status, health behaviors, environment, genetics, and healthcare are the tip of the iceberg. There are a myriad intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect our health, and our mental health is also interconnected with our bodily state. With socioeconomic status being the most driving factor for health, it seems doctors and other professionals related to keeping the health of people above water should focus on raising the socioeconomic status of their locales.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the most obese countries in the world and what are the reasons for this?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Despite global poverty, there is also global obesity. This demonstrates the imbalance the world is in now. Obesity is a dangerous condition, as it leads to early death, heart issues, and other medical problems. Being obese also is harmful to one’s self-esteem and sense of self in general. In the world today, there are about two billion overweight individuals, and this number keeps growing (CNN). Let us take a look at the most obese countries in the world and uncover why these countries stand out in the obesity epidemic.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, the United States is not the most obese country in the world. In fact, the U.S. is only the 12th most obese country in the world. The country with the highest rate of obesity in the world is Nauru, which is a tiny island close to Australia. According to WorldAtlas, “topping the list are small Pacific Island nations such as Samoa, Tonga and Kiribati, to name a few. Approximately four of every five citizens of these countries are obese or overweight. The reason is almost all of the food these island nations are imported and therefore expensive, but fast-food chains offer a cheap and convenient alternative” (Dillinger, Jessica). Besides the food choices of the citizens of these islands, the environment on these islands are conducive for relaxation. This makes exercise and doing hard work less preferable.\n\nThe countries next in line after islands are Middle Eastern countries. The WorldAtlas states that “75 percent of these countries’ population is overweight and well over a third is considered obese. With scorching hot temperatures of up to 40 degree Celsius, regular ‘natural’ exercise such as walking is not common with an increasing embrace for western fast food restaurants in recent years. Traditionally, people often share large community platters, making it difficult keep track of portion size” (Dillinger, Jessica). In addition, many wealthy native people of Middle Eastern countries have others work for them, while they own companies and lands. This lack of movement makes them gain more weight.\n\nJammed between the Middle Eastern countries on the list is the United States. The reason for the United States being high on the obesity list is a complex of factors. As Walter Willett, chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, states, “Part of this is due to lower incomes and education, which result in purchases of cheap foods that are high in refined starch and sugar. More deeply, this also reflects lower public investment in education, public transportation, and recreational facilities. The bottom line: cheap, unhealthy foods mixed with a sedentary lifestyle has made obesity the new normal in America” (U.S. News & World Report). And what is interesting is that the American lifestyle has seeped into the countries that are on the top of the list of the most obese countries. So, in fact, they have outdone America in its own habits to become more obese than America.\n\nObesity is a global catastrophe, and island nations, the Middle East, and the U.S. spearhead this issue. The lack of access to quality food, a lack of exercise, and a lack of education about health all contribute to obesity. According to the statistics, obesity rates are continuing to rise. What will stop this conundrum? Only time will tell.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the most powerful psychological stress factors?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Modern psychology leans towards believing that maturing is a continuous process which can last one’s entire life, rather than a single moment of psychological “initiation,” after which a person realizes that he or she has become an adult. Respectively, challenges we have to deal with almost always correspond with the stage of psychological development we are currently in. Problems we go through as teenagers at high school and those we face as grown-up individuals differ in nature and complexity, although our emotional response mechanisms remain the same: in difficult situations, our bodies react with stress.\n\nBeing stressed is normal, usually. In fact, stress is not necessarily a negative feeling, but rather a condition in which we find ourselves during or after periods of emotional and/or physical loads. In other words, even positive factors such as marriage or graduation can be stressful. Normally, after a stressful factor is eliminated, our psyche goes back to its normal condition. However, if a person was exposed to a series of stressful events, or remained under stress for a long period of time, it may become not so easy to get rid of it.\n\nIn fact, psychologists distinguish between three main kinds of stress: acute, episodic, and chronic (Psychologist World). Acute stress is a result of short-term yet traumatic events—for example, a car accident, a conflict with a friend or relative, witnessing or falling victim to violence, and so on. Episodic stress is what we all go through on an everyday basis: short-term situations we have to deal with every day, and which have become almost habitual. For instance, getting stuck in a traffic jam and being late for work, or having a deadline at work, or paying taxes—these are some examples of episodic stressful events which can affect us negatively, but which are bearable and manageable. And finally, chronic stress is a result of processes that occur in our lives, and the effects of which are prolonged in time as well. Perhaps the best example of a situation causing chronic stress is an unhappy marriage, when both a wife and a husband suffer, but have no courage to get divorced.\n\nNaturally, emotional sensitivity varies in each individual, so the same events can cause different emotional responses in people. What is a mundane morning ride to work for one person can be daily hell for another one; one spouse may be content with his or her marriage, while the other one can feel trapped and unable to go on with the relationship any longer. At the same time, there are stress factors that tend to cause negative emotions of approximately the same intensity in almost everyone.\n\nAccording to the Holmes-Raye Social Readjustment Rating Scale, one of the most emotionally-crippling factors of stress is the death of a loved one (LiveStrong.com). The situation gets worse if spouses had common business or debts, so after the death of one of them, another one has to take full responsibility of chores. However, it is not only a spouse whose death can cause intense stress: the death of a parent, a child, a friend, or a significant other can cause intense emotional pain as well. As the time goes, the pain will become less acute, but the psyche will take vast amounts of time to recover—this is a natural part of the process of grieving, so little can be done about it.\n\nSimilarly to the loss of a loved one, divorce is another factor of stress that affects the majority of people with similar strength. Unlike dating, divorce implies not just two people breaking up and starting to live separately, but also a number of legal consequences which need to be attended to. Divorce usually means moving to a different place, learning to live a single life, sharing custody over children, dividing property, breaking previously-established social connections, and so on. This is a huge change in the life of any individual, and even if spouses hated each other and the divorce was their first step towards a long-anticipated peaceful life, judicial and legal matters following a divorce can cause huge amounts of stress.\n\nFinancial worries can be a powerful stress factor as well. We live in a world where a huge part of information perceived by every individual is advertising certain goods and services. The number of material temptations is overwhelming, and financial systems support ubiquitous consumption via loans, crediting policies, etc. From one angle, this increases the standards of living, and makes people’s lives more comfortable, and goods more accessible. On the other hand, having to pay numerous bills, loans, credits, calculating incomes and expenses, financially supporting other people, and so on, is known to cause immense stress (Psychologist World). Financial worries are not something rich people are free of: in fact, just as in case with divorce and death, financial problems can become a huge strain in the life of every individual, regardless of their incomes.\n\nPsychological stress is a normal part of living. While some people tend to be more emotional than others, there are stress factors that can affect almost everyone, regardless of their sensitivity. Among the most powerful ones are the death of a loved one, divorce, and worries related to finance and money. No matter what the reason is, it is important to learn how to manage stress in order to not let it become chronic and overwhelming.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the reasons why people develop low self-esteem?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Western society seems to be promoting self-confidence as the ultimate response to any challenge a person might experience throughout his or her lifetime. Starting with games for children in which no one loses (to prevent disappointment) and ending up with motivational messages of commercials appealing to consumers’ desires for success and prestige, everything seems to be aimed at developing, boosting, and then exploiting people’s self-confidence. Being a person with low self-esteem or a person not confident enough in his or her own capabilities, talents, desires, or motives is nowadays somewhat equal to being ostracized; the range of reactions to such a person (if the lack of self-esteem is evident to others) may vary from friendly advice, to a hostile and/or disparaging attitude. This can be easily noticed in American society, where it is rarely acceptable to openly admit or complain about one’s own flaws and/or hardships. This teaches people to learn how to deal with their problems on their own, which is a useful skill; on the other hand, there may be situations when a person finds it hard to overcome the difficulties he or she has to face; in this case, this person may feel inferior to other people who “are okay” (at least claim to be). In other words, a person’s self-esteem may drop.\n\nIn fact, this is not the only reason why people develop low self-esteem. Moreover, it is important to remember that the decreased feeling of self-worth is not innate; it is acquirable, and can occur as a result of traumatic events, a bad attitude, dysfunctional relationships, or a number of other factors. Let us take a closer look at some of them.\n\nOne of the most common reasons for a decreased feeling of self-worth as an adult is bullying that occurred in a person’s past. It may not be the bullying alone, but a combination of emotionally distant and/or unresponsive parents that may be the issue. When being subject to bullying, a child may experience a wide range of negative physical and emotional influences; a child may be beaten, verbally insulted, mocked, and so on, on a regular basis. For a young mind, this is often a harsh situation—even adults often face difficulties when interacting with hostile environments. Anyways, for a bullied child, it is extremely important to feel love, support, and understanding from his or her parents. In a safe, aware, and responsive family, a child has a chance to recover, share his or her difficulties with loving parents, and through this, preserve his or her self-esteem. In such families, a child may learn to perceive bullying as an external circumstance of his or her life, which has little to do with his or her personality. However, for those children whose parents are not aware of bullying, or whose parents do not care, or do not want to know, recovering from regular humiliation and preserving self-esteem can be challenging; rather often, a bullied child lacking support from his or her family feels abandoned, lonely, damaged, and owing anyone who treats him or her better than bullies. This can be damaging for such a child’s future relationships, and can significantly erode the quality of such a child’s life in the future (Psychology Today).\n\nEven if we take the former out of the equation of “bullying plus negligent parents equals low self-esteem,” we will still deduce a credible reason for so many people not feeling good about themselves. Psychologists know that often it is not just about what we think of ourselves, but what people around us (first and foremost, those significant to us) think about us as well, how they treat us, and what emotions they display and direct towards us. For any child, his or her parents or guardians are the most important and influential figures, and this situation does not change for a long time. A child fortunate to have been raised in an atmosphere of love and support has no problems with self-esteem in the majority of cases; on the contrary, for those whose parents suffered from mental illnesses, substance abuse, were cold and negligent, or did not provide them with comfort and warmth due to other reasons, life can feel rather difficult, as they often “inherit” the attitude of their parents towards themselves (Good Choices Good Life). In other words, if parents did not bother to feed their child on time, dress him or her up properly, did not care about the child’s hygiene, education, and other needs, this child will most likely grow up as a person who does not care for himself or herself either. This mechanism does not necessarily work like a mirror, but the connection between parents’ attitude towards a child and this child’s attitude to himself or herself in the future manifests itself in behavioral tendencies, which are sometimes so clear that it is difficult to deny this influence.\n\nAs surprising as it may sound, self-esteem can drop not only because of previous traumas, problematic relationships, or abuse, but also from conventionally positive and inspiring parts of life. In particular, goal-setting and the ambitious pursuit of something a person holds dear can cause a severe decrease in self-esteem (Mindvalley Blog). This can work two ways. Most often, a person sets up a goal so unrealistic (either in terms of its scale, or the term in which it must be accomplished) that it is almost doomed to failure from the start. In this case, if no corrections to the initial plans are made, such a failure may cause a person’s self-esteem to decrease temporarily; many people revise their goals and make necessary adjustments to them. However, there may also be a scenario when a person subconsciously “sabotages” his or her own self-esteem, setting deliberately unrealistic goals, standards, or requirements, and then failing to reach them. Although these two situations look alike and have similar outcomes, they have different underlying backgrounds: the former situation is a result of miscalculation, when a person overestimates his or her abilities, underestimates or neglects life circumstances, and so on; the latter, in its turn, may be a result of subconscious processes set in motion at a young age, and aimed at sustaining an individual’s low self-esteem.\n\nThe list of reasons above is not comprehensive; it just highlights two of the most common factors leading to low self-esteem (relationships with unsupportive and emotionally-cold parents or caregivers, as well as being subject to bullying and peer pressure, without the possibility to share difficult life situations with parents), and points out one less obvious, but nevertheless important factor: unrealistic and premature goal-setting. The latter, in its turn, may be either an outcome of insufficient experience, or the influence of subconscious processes aimed at sustaining a person’s self-esteem.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the main causes of deforestation and what is being done about it?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Major deforestation is a known issue today, but not many think about it as more than just a statistic. Though forests still cover roughly 30% of Earth’s surface, forests as large as half of England are being cut down each year. At the current rate of deforestation, rainforests will no longer exist within 100 years (National Geographic). What are the main causes of deforestation and what is being done about it? We will explore these topics in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe main cause of deforestation is agriculture, specifically subsistence farming (48%) and commercial agriculture (32%). The two other causes of deforestation is logging (14%) and fuel wood removals (5%) (UNFCCC). However, not all deforestation is done with intent, for instance, natural wildfires and overgrazing (National Geographic).\n\nWhat can we do about this exponential advance of deforestation? Sustainable forestry is one option. As you might have guessed, sustainable forestry focuses on doing as little damage as possible to the ecosystem in which the forests reside. The regimen for this practice is planting trees after logging, cutting back on soil erosion, and limiting damage to habitats and water purity (Seattle PI).\n\nSince one of the main causes of deforestation is clearing land for agriculture, erosion control is pertinent. Erosion control consists of maintaining soil quality, and matching crops and farming techniques with terrain. The maintenance of soil quality results in less deforestation, as it lends to less clearing of land for agriculture (Seattle PI).\n\nAnother action that can cut back on deforestation is stewardship. This implies the caring of indigenous people residing on land scheduled for logging and agriculture, the monitoring of legal troubles and abidance, and aiding farmers while logging is happening in their areas. You can become an independent steward, but you can also join The Forest Stewardship Council as well, or at least support it (Seattle PI).\n\nOur forests are rapidly disappearing due to agriculture, logging, fuel wood removals. However, with the help of sustainable forestry, erosion control, and stewardship, we might be able to properly fight back against the total elimination of the world’s forests. Though the future looks bleak, humankind has almost always stepped up to the challenge of solving our problems when the situation is truly dire.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the most common reasons for teenagers to run away from home?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Adolescence is probably the most extreme period in the life of an individual. Transiting from childhood to being an adult is full of rioting, searching for one’s identity and purpose, developing new models of behavior, psychologically separating from parents, and maturing. Many people tend to remember their teen years as the most saturated and meaningful—even though what teenagers usually do is hang out with friends and party. This age, however, is not as carefree and unclouded as it seems; teenagers, due to hormonal hurricanes and the psychological peculiarities of this age, often get themselves in trouble. Millions of parents around the world are worried that their children at this age will get in the wrong surrounding, start doing drugs, or drink alcohol; there is, at the same time, a problem that is no less dangerous: running away from home.\n\nAlthough it might seem romantic—escaping home and wandering around the country or abroad, in search of one’s purpose or for whatever other reason—the reality is different. According to statistics, every year, up to 2.8 million teens who escape from home have to live on the streets. Among them, about 50% have been kicked out of their homes or shelters at least once, and they specified home conflicts being one of the main reasons of this; according to the reports of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, about 20% of young people who have been thrown out of their homes or escaped faced physical and/or sexual abuse, or felt they were under the threat of abuse. Overall, more than 60% of runaway teenagers have depression, half of them have problems at school, and about 20% have developed substance addiction (National Safe Place). As it can be seen from the statistics, being a runaway is not about romantically searching for their place in the world, but rather suffering from injustice, poverty, violence, and depression.\n\nOf course, there are cases when teens run away because of something bad at home (for example, a big fight with parents, or harsh restrictions, and so on). However, for a large percentage of runaways, the need to escape is innate, due to systematic misfortunes at home or school. In this regard, specialists distinguish between episodic running away and chronic running away. Episodic running away does not have a consistent pattern, and usually it not used to manipulate parents. More likely, episodic runaways occur in order to avoid punishment for misbehavior or misconduct, possible humiliation (for instance, from peers at school), or embarrassment. In the case of chronic running away, the situation is different; teenagers who regularly escape from home may be using this strategy to influence their parents, draw their attention if other means do not prove to be efficient, manipulate parents, or act out. One of the signs of such a pattern is when a teenager uses phrases such as: “If you make me do this/If you do not do that, I will run away.” They may threaten their parents by saying, “If you make me do that, I’ll run away,” knowing that running away is what many parents are afraid of. This is a bargaining strategy, and parents can engage in it without fully realizing they in fact cater to such behavioral patterns, not prevent them. Once a parent concedes to such blackmailing, a teenager may start using it more to always get what he or she wants; when such a relationship model substitutes direct and open communication between children and parents, it is not a healthy relationship anymore (Empowering Parents).\n\nAs for the reasons why teenagers choose to escape can be numerous. Among the most common ones are abuse (physical, emotional, sexual, and so on), substance addiction, and peer pressure. According to a study conducted at the University of Chicago, the most common reason for teenagers to run away from home is the lack of support and understanding coming from family members—and this is the best-case scenario. Unfortunately, there are numerous cases when teens have been molested, beaten, humiliated, threatened, and mistreated in their families; the fact that parents—probably the closest people to a teen—do this to him or her deeply undermines a young person’s ability to trust the world and his or her given society. Often being dependent on their parents in terms of finance or a place to live, they do not have an effective means of preventing or stopping harm from their parents; running away for such children seems to be the only valid option. Nearly the same is the situation for many teenagers at schools; feeling like a black sheep in class or being bullied, such teens tend to choose radical ways of problem solving. There were infamous cases when such teens committed mass shootings in the schools they studied at, but less psychologically traumatized children prefer to eliminate themselves from the stressful environment—through running away, usually. As for substance addiction, it commonly accompanies the aforementioned problems; a healthy teenager who has good relationships within and outside the family rarely feels the desire to try out drugs, for example; this may be done as an experiment or a part of teenage rioting behavior, but rarely turns into a consistent pattern typical for addicts. Nevertheless, teenagers who develop a substance addiction may run away from home in order to conceal this addiction from their parents, find money (often illegally) to buy more drugs or alcohol, or because they got into trouble connected to substances. Either way, parents need to look out for the signs of addiction a child may display in order to be able to notice the problem in time and try to solve it before it is too late.\n\nRunning away as a teen is a dangerous act. Teens who escape their homes often have to live in poverty, depression, and abuse; trying to solve problems (such as physical or emotional abuse, for example) at school or home, they run away hoping to get away from the source of distress; however, living on the streets means becoming less protected and more vulnerable, so the reason why teens escape does not vanish. Therefore, parents should be more attentive to their children, encourage direct communication, and watch out for signs of problems their child might be demonstrating in order to prevent the situation from becoming worse.###"}
{"prompt": "How do social media platforms affect people's social skills?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " With the emergence of Facebook, the way people communicate with each other changed forever. A social network allowing users to share the events of their lives through posting photos and status updates, to monitor the lives of their friends, and to communicate directly via a built-in messenger has revolutionized Internet communication, causing millions of people all over the world to share all kinds of information about themselves. There were, of course, other social networks before Facebook, but none of them garnered such a significant user base, remained as persistent, and continued to act as an effective form of communication as much as Facebook did. Along with Facebook, currently there are many other social networks, each with their own features and purposes; what unites them all, though, is the idea of sharing. Seemingly, this should positively impact the communication skills of users, since it allows communication even for people far away from each other, or who are unable to communicate live. However, there have been numerous research studies proving the opposite: social media platforms not only impair a user’s ability to share thoughts, but distort communication processes, creating more problems than they solve.\n\nSpeaking of the positive effects of social networks, they lie on the surface. According to surveys, 39% of respondents reported feeling closer to their friends because of social media, while 26% of the sample felt that they had more friends because of social media (NR Media). Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other similar services make daily communications between family members, friends, and business partners easier, more accessible, and independent of circumstances, such as distance. Communities existing on such platforms unite people sharing similar interests or concerns, and allow the representatives of various cultural backgrounds to reach each other with no constraints. Helping strangers meet and enabling initial communication between them—this is what social networks are definitely good for.\n\nAt the same time, numerous research studies prove that social media platforms negatively affect people’s social skills. Probably the most alarming phenomenon connected to the extensive use of social media services is the decrease in quality of interpersonal communication. One of the big problems in modern interpersonal communication is the lack of interest people have for face-to-face communication; even today, there are many people (especially millennials, or younger) who prefer to solve work or personal problems via social messaging systems. Approximately 93 percent of communication today is already nonverbal, and thus requires an additional means of helping people understand each other (such as smileys or emojis), since text does not convey the total palette of intonations or facial expressions. This brings up several problems; for example, without these means, it is often more difficult to understand another person in a messenger system (the classical “he/she did not insert smileys, so I thought he/she is mad at me”); or, in real life, it may become harder to differentiate and understand real emotions. According to some experts, even families prefer texting over face-to-face chat. All this leads to difficulties in professional and personal relationships (Rampages.us).\n\nSubstituting real life experiences and events with Facebook-format online updates is another problem. Studies show that about 11 percent of adults prefer to stay at home on weekends and make posts on Facebook about how much fun they are having, instead of going out and acquiring real-life experiences. According to Hussein Chahine, the founder of the service Yazino, “Communication is constantly evolving. Some people are as used to seeing their friends’ online avatar as they are their face […] People increasingly prefer quick and frequent engagement with instant updates on news than a prolonged chat and are also finding new ways to catch up with friends from the comfort of their sofa.” Mark Clennon, a graduate of the University of South Florida, says that “People tend to want to show others that they are having fun than actually having fun themselves […] There’s a greater desire to share with other people you barely know, than actually hanging out with friends and making memories” (USA Today College). This is directly connected to another problem: “Facebook depression.” Generally speaking, it is the sense of inferiority occurring when people (teenagers, mostly) compare their real lives to the lives of their Facebook friends—based on the posts these friends make online—completely missing out on the fact that what they see is not necessarily true (NYBH). As a result, an interesting and alarming phenomenon emerges: many people sit at home, busy creating visibility of living fulfilled, happy lives, and suffer when they see how fulfilled the lives of other people are—who, in their turn, sit at home, busy creating visibility of living fulfilled, happy lives. This is a poignant example of a vicious circle.\n\nYet another impairment of communication skills caused by the extensive use of social media platforms is the impoverishment of language. Using messengers, people often use shorthand and shortened versions of words in order to type and deliver their messages as quickly as possible. However, such means of communication are much less effective than conventional ones (or rather, traditional, since contractions, slang, and abbreviations such as “brb,” “u r,” “m8,” “dunno,” and so on have already become almost conventional), and people getting used to them can experience difficulties in real-life interpersonal communication (Rampages.us). This is not to mention illiteracy, which is already becoming a scourge of this generation communicating through messengers.\n\nAlthough social media may help people establish initial contact and aid people in uniting into groups under certain interests, they also cause a number of problems. In particular, nonverbal communication is gradually becoming one of the dominant forms of interpersonal interaction, negatively affecting people’s ability to deal with personal contact and meet the reactions and emotions of other people in real life. A significant percent of adults (up to 11 percent) prefer staying at home and communicating via their devices rather than going out and acquiring real-life experiences. This, along with “Facebook depression” and the overall impoverishment of language and communication skills, is alarming, and requires adequate and timely measures.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the ways in which low self-esteem is caused?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Throughout the recent decades, psychology has become extremely popular in western countries. Starting from all kinds of coaching programs, personality trainings, and professional psychotherapy sessions, psychology is constantly being at the center of public attention. Terms like “subconsciousness,” “psychological resistance,” “self-esteem,” calls to “love yourself” and “accept your uniqueness” sound from almost everywhere. At the same time, people seem to often simplify and misunderstand the basics of psychology. People talk about how important it is to increase self-esteem and accept oneself—but no one says how exactly this can be done, or what may become an obstacle. Self-esteem, in particular, is the term that is juggled with the most frequently; “increasing self-esteem” is probably the most popular advice people give to each other on every possible occasion. At the same time, as it is often the case in psychology, low self-esteem is not just the way a person thinks about himself or herself, but rather a complex aggregate of behavioral and mental patterns, changing which requires much more patience and effort than simply saying to oneself, “I am awesome.” Let us take a closer look at what exactly causes people to underestimate themselves.\n\nDecreased self-esteem, or the inhibited feeling of self-worth is influenced, as it is often the case, by the problems in communication with authoritative others in childhood. This is especially true if a child is raised while being constantly criticized, taught how to do things “right,” and not appreciated no matter how hard he or she tries, or shamed and blamed. This causes a child to grow up into an adult that constantly doubts his or her worth, trying to please other people in order to gain acceptance or to avoid critics. At the same time, there is a “passive” way parents can harm their child. Even if they do not criticize their child, inactive, emotionally-cold parents contribute to a child developing low self-esteem in the future; children need to feel love and attention from their parents, and if parents are preoccupied and do not (or cannot) notice their child’s behaviors, accomplishments, and manifestations, it can also cause psychological harm. A child in such a family may feel unnoticed, unimportant, and abandoned. This may cause a person to develop a need to “apologize” for their existence—for example, trying to be “useful,” or justify the fact of his or her life in some other ways. In addition, when parents or other authoritative figures raising a child are in conflict with each other, it can pose psychological danger as well: feeling overwhelmed and scared by constant conflicts, a child may develop a sense of guilt, considering himself or herself somehow responsible for the fact that adults are fighting with each other. This may result in feeling “tainted,” “guilty,” and can be carried on into adult life (Psychology Today).\n\nChildren, when in groups, can be extremely cruel—this is a well-known fact, although it does not mean that children are bad: because they are in the process of adopting and understanding social norms, since they are only learning empathy and compassion, children often cannot distinguish between what is wrong and what is right. As a result, they can cause physical and psychological pain to each other. Rather often, there is a child who is somehow different from others: poorer, smarter, awkward, and so on; such children usually become objects for bullying and hatred. Negative attitudes from peers and being subjected to bullying decreases self-esteem dramatically. It is an innate need of every person to be a part of some group, to be respected and recognized; even for adults, it can be difficult to stay in a hostile or negligent collective of people. For children, it can be devastating: having to face hostile environments day by day, year by year (for example, because a child has to go to the same school, and is ashamed to tell his or her parents about being bullied and humiliated) may cause an individual to think that something is wrong with them, that they are somehow “bad” or inferior (Good Choices Good Life). Needless to say that such feelings transit to adult life, causing painful doubts in a person’s self-worth, obstructing communication and trust with other people, and making such a person to feel ashamed for every small discrepancy in their looks, way of thinking, and so on.\n\nYet another way to cause a child to develop low self-esteem is abuse: emotional, physical, or sexual—it does not matter. Any case of abuse is a potential psychological trauma, which can remain in a child’s psyche for years (sometimes for his or her entire life); abuse in the past may even cause PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder), which only makes a child’s condition worse, making him or her constantly feel “damaged” and worthless (self-confidence.co.uk). For many people, the facts of physical or any other abuse cause severe distress, and can lead to depression, addiction, and other forms of negative self-attitude. An abused child requires psychological help—the sooner, the better.\n\nThere are many ways in which parents, environments, and peers can cause a child to develop low self-esteem, which later transits to adult life. Negligence, emotional coldness, criticism, a lack of appreciation, bullying, humiliation, as well as abuse (physical, emotional, or sexual) can harm a child’s psyche. In order to help a person overcome such traumas, the help of a professional psychotherapist may be needed.###"}
{"prompt": "How will the automation of jobs affect society in the future?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As exciting as the advancement of cybernetics and robotics might look, it also poses a challenge to the way of life we have got accustomed to throughout centuries. Perhaps since the beginning of time, there was a job to do, and a man or woman who performed it. The results of this work—food, goods, money—belonged to human beings. Work has always been both a way to make a living, and a way of self-realization, a fulfillment of one’s calling, and a duty. It is also true that it has always been time-consuming, occupying the time one could probably spend with family, or on hobbies and other activities.\n\nThe latter (along with the ever-existing pursuit of increased productivity) caused scientists and inventors to think whether work could be performed on its own, without the participation of people—in order to use their time and energy for something more pleasant, interesting, etc. And in the 21st century, automation and robotic engineering have become the answer to this search; supposedly, almost any manned job can be performed by a machine. Unfortunately, along with the new industrial revolution, the increase of work efficiency, and other benefits, automation will also most likely cause several critical issues to emerge—mass unemployment probably being the major one.\n\nErik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, and his colleague Andrew McAfee believe the rapid progress in computer and robotic spheres (for example, the usage of robots in heavy industries, or the widespread usage of automated translation services, and so on) do not correspond with the slow rates of employment growth. In other words, technologies take more jobs than a modern society can produce; this is not to mention that automation reaches, or is about to reach, not only such spheres as manufacturing or retail jobs, but also education, finance, law, and medicine. This is a worrying sign, because such a spread of automation means qualified people gradually losing their workplace in favor of machines; all this can lead to the stagnation of the median income, as well as the growth of inequality—this regards the United States and other technologically-developed countries (MIT Technology Review).\n\nThe question arising in relation to this is which jobs are under threat? Generally speaking, automation mostly affects physical labor, such as driving or vending. In 2013, Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne published a study in which they researched around 700 professions in terms of them possibly being automated. What they discovered is that about 47% of workers in the United States are in the zone of risk, because the specifics of their jobs implied they could be replaced by machines (for the United Kingdom, this index is 35%, and for Japan, around 49%). For example, such spheres as transportation (including taxi and delivery services), logistics, services (sales, technical support, telemarketers, accountants, etc.) are among the most vulnerable ones. According to the authors of the study, “recent developments in machine learning will put a substantial share of employment, across a wide range of occupations, at risk in the near future.” (The Economist).\n\nYet another study involving 1,896 experts required them to answer the following question: “Will networked, automated, artificial intelligence (AI) applications and robotic devices displace more jobs than they have created by 2025?” The opinions on this subject have fallen into two approximately equal halves. About 52% of experts believe technologies will not replace people in the number of jobs bigger than they create by 2025—as it had happened before, during the previous industrial revolutions; however, the other half—48% of the experts questioned—believed automation will inevitably displace huge numbers of people working at “blue collar” and “white collar” jobs, as many qualified specialists would become unemployable; the latter is expected to cause a dramatic increase of inequality in terms of income, and the disturbances of the habitual social order existing currents (Pew Research Center).\n\nAs it can be seen, the automation of jobs is not by default beneficial for modern society. It is true that it can increase the efficiency of work in a number of professional areas, but the cost is expected to be high; according to studies conducted in this direction, automation will leave countless competent specialists unemployed (mostly in transportation, logistics, sales and services spheres). This is expected to increase income inequality dramatically, and disrupt the existing social order—societies of technologically-advanced countries (and gradually, all over the world) will have to adapt to new conditions, seeking to create innovative workplaces and occupations. So far, this looks more important and dramatic than the anticipated possibility to have more time for leisure and hobbies.###"}
{"prompt": "How does insomnia lead to a wide range of health problems?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " One of the most common health problems of modernity is insomnia—or, how it is also often called, sleep deprivation. Its prevalence is caused by the fact that it, firstly, accompanies a large number of mental conditions (starting from regular anxiety and/or frustration, and ending up with depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and so on), and secondly, by a number of environmental factors, such as noise pollution. Regardless of the reasons causing it, insomnia is a dangerous condition, being a cause of a wide range of health problems, both mental and physical.\n\nInsomnia greatly affects our cognitive and perceptual abilities in a negative way. Matthew Walker, director of the Sleep and Neuroimaging Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, conducted research revealing insomnia’s influence on amygdala—the part of brain responsible for getting the body prepared for danger. The study revealed that the lack or absence of sleep greatly inhibits the amygdala’s functionality, as well obstructs logical reasoning and basic reflexes, such as the “fight or flight” reflex, memory capacity, and speech capabilities. This is not to mention irritability, worsened concentration, and the danger to fall asleep while driving (NewsWeek).\n\nWidely known are also some other psychological effects of continuous sleep deprivation, such as the loss of concentration, deceptions of perception, thinking integrity violation, hallucinations, and irreversible psychological and neurological damage.\n\nInsomnia affects not only the mind, but also the body in ways no less devastating; specifically, according to a study conducted by the University of Chicago, sleep deprivation is closely connected to the reduced control of blood-sugar levels. This means the lack of sleep can cause the increased risks of diabetes; and the absence of sleep possesses even greater destructive potential. “Сhronic sleep restriction over days and weeks and months is what alters glucose metabolism, nudging it toward the pre-diabetic end of the spectrum […] And sleep loss leads to an increased inflammatory response, which damages the arteries in the brain, heart, and kidneys over time,” explains Dr. Gregory Belenky, M.D., research professor and director of the Sleep and Performance Research Center at Washington State University in Spokane (HealthCommunities).\n\nApart from diabetes, insomnia can lead to a number of heart and vascular problems. According to research conducted at Columbia University in New York, regularly experiencing a severe lack of sleep can double the risks of developing hypertension within a mid-term period (of about 10 years). “When you sleep, your blood pressure and heart rate normally dip by about 10 to 20 percent […] If you habitually sleep less than the optimal amount, blood pressure and heart rate actually increases over 24 hours, which puts additional strain on the cardiovascular system. Over time, this can gradually reset the entire cardiovascular system so that it operates at an elevated pressure all the time,” says assistant professor of psychiatry at Columbia James Gangwisch, Ph.D. (HealthCommunities).\n\nA surprising effect of sleep deprivation is obesity. Although it might seem that these two phenomenons are not connected, in fact there is a relationship between them. According to a 13-year study observing about 500 adults, there was a 7.5 higher risk for people in the age of 27-30 years to develop a higher body mass index due to the lack of sleep (NCBI).\n\nInsomnia (of any sub type) can also lead to early death. The highest risk of early death was observed among individuals with the chronic early-awakening type of insomnia, as well as among those who experienced difficulties with sleep maintenance (meaning these people had problems with the continuity and integrity of sleep, as well as with getting back to sleep once awoken). According to the research involving almost 2.5 thousand people surveyed in 1989, 1994, and 2000, throughout 19 years, about 128 people with insomnia had died earlier than they should because of it (and health problems related to it) by May 2010 (Mercola.com).\n\nAs it can be seen, insomnia, or sleep deprivation, is a dangerous condition leading to a wide range of health problems. For instance, prolonged periods of sleep deprivation obstructs cognitive and perceptual functions. It also increases the chances of developing diabetes, cardio-vascular problems, and in general, can lead to early death. Therefore, if one faces such a problem as insomnia, he or she should do their best to solve it as quickly as possible.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the causes of amnesia?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Almost any time when you watch a Hollywood action movie, or play an action video game, you will most likely meet a character suffering from memory loss. This phenomena of memory loss, also known as amnesia, is a complicated neurological mechanism, hiding behind a seemingly simple facade. Amnesia is extremely widespread worldwide, because, unlike popular belief, it can be triggered not only by a head trauma, but also by a number of other factors.\n\nSo, what exactly is amnesia? Doctors usually use this term to define a group of mental conditions characterized by a temporary (most often) disturbance or complete loss of the ability to recall stored memories, or memorize something (The Human Memory). The causes of amnesia will be analyzed below; so far, it is important to point out that there exist at least four major types of this mental condition: retrograde amnesia, anterograde amnesia, transient global amnesia, and infantile amnesia.\n\nRetrograde amnesia is probably what the majority of people have in their minds when talking about this mental condition; retrograde amnesia implies a person’s inability (or impaired ability) to recall events that occurred in the past. Although it might be a result of a trauma, there can be other factors causing this condition, including various mental disorders. Anterograde amnesia prevents a person from forming new memories. The memories stored in the brain before the case leading to amnesia can be perfectly preserved, but at some point, it stops memorizing objects, events, etc. around it, leading to the inability to recall the most recent events (those that occurred after the amnesia-causing case). For example, a person who overused alcohol and experienced a blackout will most likely be unable to remember everything that followed the episode of getting drunk, although other memories (such as a person’s name or living place will remain untouched). Another type of amnesia—transient global amnesia—can appear and vanish within a couple of hours. TGA is not studied well enough, but scientists believe it has something to do with a seizure-like contraction of the blood vessels supplying the brain; as a result, a person may “fall out” of the memorization process, losing memories immediately preceding the “seizure,” and those that would be obtained within its course. Yet another type—infantile amnesia—is something that all of us have experienced: it is a natural condition when a person cannot remember (clearly, or entirely) their first 3-5 years of life (Health Line).\n\nAs for symptoms, there are two major signs of amnesia: a degraded ability to memorize something new (anterograde amnesia), or a disability to recall events from the past (retrograde amnesia). It can take different forms—for example, a person might not be able to recall what they have been doing five minutes ago (problems with short-term memory), but would perfectly restore the details of some presidential election that occurred 20 years ago; or, vice versa, a person could live with a memory span of a couple of minutes, completely forgetting everything that goes beyond this time limit. Unlike some people tend to think, amnesia is not the same as dementia: amnesiac memory loss does not affect one’s intelligence or personality. Rather often, people with amnesia understand there is a problem with their memorizing capabilities, and do not lose the adequacy of perception and actions. There are also some other symptoms typical for amnesia: confabulation (a condition when a person unintentionally makes up their memories in order to fill the gap in perception; these memories may be made up completely from scratch, or combined from fragments of real ones) and disorientation (Mayo Clinic).\n\nThere are several major causes of amnesia: seizures and strokes (which tend to do a lot of brain damage, so it is unsurprising that they often cause memory loss); brain inflammations such as encephalitis, as well as viruses such as herpes; oxygen deprivation; organic changes in the brain structure (for example, in cases of schizophrenia or brain tumors) or head injuries. There are also causes of psychogenic origins; for example, victims of rape or molestation often subconsciously develop a form of amnesia to protect themselves from painful memories. Soldiers who have gone through extremely stressful combat situations, victims of natural disasters, terrorist acts and other forms of violence can also develop certain forms of amnesia as a response to traumatizing experiences.\n\nAs we can see, amnesia is not the same as dementia or other cognitive-behavioral disorders. It does not affect one’s personality, judgment, or perceptive-cognitive capabilities, but only affects a person’s ability to memorize and/or recall events. There are several types of amnesia, such as retrograde/anterograde amnesia, transient global amnesia, and infantile amnesia. The main signs of any form of amnesia are either an impaired ability to recall the events that occurred in the past, or to memorize/learn new information. The factors causing amnesia can have different origins, starting from head injuries or mental disorders, and ending up with traumatizing experiences or viruses.###"}
{"prompt": "How will virtual reality affect humanity?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " It is commonplace that technologies are changing the world we live in. Roughly every two decades, Earth becomes almost a brand new place in terms of technological wonders becoming routine, and revolutionary ideas settling as solid scientific theories. However, we might not be aware of the extent to which the world is changing—not just because we constantly live within the eye of the hurricane, so to say, but also because technologies sometimes advance too fast for us to comprehend and evaluate their influence on the ways we live, think, feel, and behave. One of such technologies is virtual reality, or VR: a concept introduced by science-fiction writers and scientists quite a while ago, but is now becoming a trending technology worldwide. And, since it is obvious that VR will from now on be an inalienable part of the world, it is important to contemplate the ways in which it will affect humanity.\n\nIf we analyze the term “virtual reality,” we naturally need to understand what each of its two components mean on their own. So, according to the online Merriam-Webster dictionary, “virtual” means “very close to being something without actually being it” (Merriam-Webster.com). Specifically, this adjective is mostly applied to the environments created with the help of computers (as in video games, for example). “Reality,” in its turn, is broadly speaking about the whole three-dimensional world we live in and interact with. Considering these two definitions, it can be said that virtual reality is an artificially-created three-dimensional environment constructed with the help of computers, which people can interact with in the same way as they do with the real world, using their senses to navigate and explore it.\n\nComputer generation can emulate situations and environments hardly possible in the real present world: visual effects we can see in movies such as “Transformers” or “Avatar” make a solid example of this statement; no need to say that emulating regular real-life situations is also possible for VR. Therefore, VR can be used to enable people perform actions without affecting the real world, which is especially useful for all kinds of training and practices. For instance, a future jet pilot can safely learn how to maintain and fly their aircraft without putting their life at risk and wasting expensive fuel. An astronaut can practice their outer space repairing skills with the help of a computer simulation, completely emulating the conditions that he/she will face in actual space. A medical student can learn how to perform surgeries or autopsies on fully interactive body models, which can appropriately respond to a student’s every action—needless to say it is much safer for learning than when a novice surgeon performs their first operation on a real patient. Therefore, one of the most obvious effects VR will have on the modern world is the enhancement of studying and training capabilities, especially for the people involved in dangerous jobs.\n\nVR can be great for entertainment, socialization, and art. In 2015, probably the biggest social media giant, Facebook, bought Oculus VR technology, integrating the possibilities it offers into the platform. For example, with Oculus Rift, it will soon be possible to view your friends’ photos in a 360-degree mode, which basically means you will be able to be virtually present on the events you missed, seeing them from a first-person perspective, and giving you a more immersive experience (AndroidPit). Gaming and movie industries will benefit from VR technology greatly, attracting millions of new customers annually—creating engaging and thrilling entertainment products capable of fully capturing consumers attention will benefit these industries and boost their further development.\n\nAlso, virtual reality can be a great help and relief for people with limited capabilities, especially for those who are fully or partially paralyzed, and thus have to live their lives chained to only one or few locations. It can give such people an opportunity to explore the world around them in the same way people without disabilities can do: the ability to walk, run, and perform other actions we take for granted can be a life savior for the majority of paralyzed patients, and this is probably the best opportunity VR can offer humanity at the moment (Engadget). This is not to mention that VR allows things impossible in real life, such as teleportation or Superman-like flying, all of which would also be available for such people.\n\nAs it can be seen, virtual reality is a new technology that can affect the lives of many people worldwide in a number of ways. Being an artificial, three-dimensional depiction of the real world, it grants numerous opportunities for practicing a wide range of skills that would otherwise imply great risks; jet pilots or medical students, for example, would definitely appreciate the possibilities VR grants. VR can significantly change the way people interact online, making their digital experiences for immersive and realistic—for example, Facebook has integrated Oculus technology, allowing 360-degree viewing of images, and this is just the beginning. The last but not the least is the fact that VR will allow disabled people to experience what they are deprived of: walking, running, exploring the world and travelling, and so on, so its value in these terms is difficult to underestimate.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the psychological and emotional risks of abortion?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Although public morals have become more flexible and indulgent in the 21st century compared to previous epochs, there are still questions and moral problems that are difficult to evaluate and treat without bias. Abortion is one of such issues; although many progressive people have nowadays become more tolerant to abortion, there are still many arguments—apart from public opinion—that speak against this procedure. In particular, abortion causes severe psychological and emotional damage to a woman who has undergone this surgery.\n\nOne of the most common dangers awaiting women who have committed an abortion is post-abortion syndrome (PAS). It is a complex of emotional and psychological symptoms connected with the traumatizing experience of terminating pregnancy. The most common PAS symptom is the sensation of guilt, connected to recognition of an abortion as a murder; at the same time, according to studies, about 70% of women who have had abortions disapproved of abortion in general, but tended to think of themselves as exceptions. Anger is another common emotion for women who have undergone an abortion. Usually, this anger is directed at oneself when completing an abortion, and/or other people involved in making a decision about the abortion, such as spouses or relatives; however, this anger may be also directed at the woman’s current or future children. Broken relationships, psychological numbing, and depression are also a part of PAS (Leadership U).\n\nThe post-abortion syndrome with its symptoms is not the only danger that possibly awaits women who have decided to terminate their pregnancies; there are other emotional and psychological problems that are not necessarily included into PAS. For example, a woman who has undergone an abortion procedure may develop such persistent symptoms as shame, a sense of isolation, a loss of self-confidence and/or trust in other people, nightmares, insomnia, anxiety, loneliness, and suicidal thoughts. As an unpleasant bonus, these symptoms can be accompanied with various eating disorders (American Pregnancy Association).\n\nPost-abortion women often develop defensive mechanisms, allowing them to cope with stress caused by abortion; one of them is repression, which manifests itself as ignoring or suppressing emotions. This leads to various psychosomatic illnesses, deviated behaviors, and other conditions requiring psychiatric assistance. According to a study conducted in Canada throughout five years, women who had an abortion tend to seek psychiatric help much more often than those who did not terminate pregnancy—25% versus 3% respectively. Teenagers, divorced or lonely women, and those who had more than one abortion are especially vulnerable, tending to need psychiatric care most often (AfterAbortion).\n\nTerminating pregnancy is a serious procedure that causes harm not only to a fetus, but to a would-be mother as well. Apart from possible physiological risks, women who have undergone an abortion tend to have severe emotional and/or psychological problems. Among these problems are the post-abortion syndrome; a wide range of such problems as persistent shame, insomnia, eating disorders, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts; psychosomatic illnesses, deviant behaviors, and other symptoms requiring psychiatric help. All this proves that abortion is not a choice one should consider.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the causes of anhedonia?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Living in a big city in the 21st century can be stressful: noise, rush, traffic jams, intrusive commercials, bad ecology, high prices, and other factors do not contribute to one’s calmness and inner harmony. Additional stresses such as hard work, fatigue, family problems, taxes, and so on only multiply and increase the existing stress. No wonder that in such conditions, people living in cities often develop various psychological conditions that can hardly be called healthy. Depression and nervous breakdowns have become as common in the recent decades as the flu. One of such conditions is anhedonia—a dangerous condition that can be generally described as an inability to have fun and feel pleasure. But what causes it?\n\nCurrently, there are several approaches to understanding the reasons standing behind anhedonia; these approaches refer to both physiological aspects of one’s mental health (such as biochemistry) and mental ones. One of the most common theories relates to social learning as a method that might be possibly triggering anhedonia. Experts believe a child’s psychological development runs normally when he or she has an opportunity to watch the behaviors, emotional reactions, actions, and manners of people surrounding them; children repeat what they see, and respectively receive feedback, positive or negative. This feedback is what teaches a child to do or not to do something. However, when a child has less opportunities to learn from other people, or receives little-to-no feedback (and respectively, becomes deprived of the accompanying emotions), he or she might later be more prone to developing anhedonia. The same works in the case of mentally-impaired children (AlcoholRehab). Thus, one cause of anhedonia might be the lack of experiences and emotional feedback (positive or negative) in childhood.\n\nAnother cause standing behind anhedonia is depression. In fact, anhedonia is often a symptom of major depressive disorder or clinical depression. Most people who have such mental conditions usually develop high levels of anhedonia. At the same time, a research study of Faith Brynie conducted in 2009 shows that even in the case of depression, pleasure and positive emotions can be experienced in full capacity—but only during a short period of time. This results in the lack of motivation or interest to engage in activities, and thus a person deprives themselves of possible positive experiences (ePain Assist).\n\nThere are also many other reasons leading to anhedonia. Among them, one should point out such conditions as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizoid personality disorder, and other mental disorders. However, anhedonia is not always necessarily caused by only mental conditions. A common physical illness or fatigue can also lead to a short-term anhedonia. Spinal cord injuries, hyperprolactinemia, or low levels of testosterone also puts a person at risk of developing anhedonia. In some cases, this can be a result of the use of SSRI drugs (Right Diagnosis).\n\nAnhedonia is a mental condition characterized by a person’s inability to experience pleasure and positive emotions. Although research studies in 2009 showed that depressed people can also experience pleasure, this pleasure does not last long, which causes the lack of motivation to engage into potentially pleasant activities, thus forming a cycle of anhedonia. Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia can cause anhedonia; however, it would be a mistake to think only mental conditions lead to it. Sometimes, a common fatigue or sickness can deprive a person of positive emotions for some period of time. In any case, the first symptoms of anhedonia are already a reason to visit a doctor.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the effects of sleep deprivation on the human body?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Everyone has at least once in their lives stayed awake throughout an entire night. Usually, being up all night is a choice of high school or college students—commonly for partying; excessively responsible workers and workaholics also tend to spend sleepless nights working on their tasks. It is widely believed that, unlike insomnia (which means a regular lack of sleep), a couple of sleepless nights now and then cannot do much harm. Unfortunately, this is not true—being awake for 24 hours even once for a long period of time has unpleasant effects on health.\n\nEveryone knows a night spent without sleep (or having little sleep) can result in fatigue and a bad mood in the morning; many would consider this a small price for a night of fun or productive labor. However, several sleepless nights can cause more serious mental effects. In particular, your ability to focus and to make decisions will decrease significantly; having a foggy brain and unclear thinking, as well as falling asleep mid-day are also among the possible negative effects. However, in a long-term perspective, the health effects are much worse: proneness to obesity, high blood pressure, heart diseases, diabetes, and so on (NHS).\n\nFatigue and sleepiness are just the tip of the iceberg. Specifically, experts from Sweden compared the effects of one-night sleep deprivation to a mild concussion. They conducted a study in which a group of healthy young men slept 8 hours one night, and then abstained from sleep another night. The blood samples taken from the men after the sleepless night revealed a 20% increase of neurochemical markers associated with brain cells damage (compared to the samples taken after the full rest night). “Dysfunctional sleep has been linked with a range of health problems, and it looks like that’s because we’re injuring our brain by not getting enough sleep,” says W. Chris Winter, M.D., medical director of the Martha Jefferson Sleep Medicine Center in Charlottesville, Virginia (Men’s Health).\n\nAt the same time, some results of the studies were surprising. According to new research, one night without sleep can increase the levels of dopamine in the brain—a substance responsible, in particular, for wakefulness. Scientists believe that by producing more dopamine, the brain tries to compensate for the negative effects of a sleepless night; still, according to the study, cognitive deficits caused by sleep deprivation remain significant. “[…] Dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain,” says David Dinges, PhD, at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (ScienceDaily).\n\nAbstaining from sleep has no positive effects on the human body. One-night deprivation of sleep results in fatigue and irritability; several sleepless nights affect one’s ability to concentrate and make decisions. Swedish experts compared the negative effects of the lack of sleep to a mild concussion, and although studies show that the brain tries to compensate the lack of sleep by producing more dopamine, it is still not enough to compensate the harm dealt. So, no matter what your reasons are to stay awake for a prolonged time, make sure to have a normal 8 hours sleep.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the positive accomplishments of the feminist movement?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Among the socio-political movements that managed to change the world we live in, feminism can be fairly called one of the most revolutionary and influential. Before its rise, few believed women were capable of achieving something outstanding in fields other than housekeeping and motherhood. However, feminists managed to break this stereotype, resulting in the world where both genders are recognized to have equal rights and privileges; what we take for granted nowadays is the long and solid effort of women all over the world to expand their possibilities to be active within business and government.\n\nModern feminism can be traced back to the 19th century, when the suffragists—women who fought for the equality of men’s and women’s rights—achieved their first victory; in 1869, in Wyoming, women were given a right to vote during elections—or, women rather struggled and won to gain this right. In the 1890s, women won the right to vote in several other states. After decades of intense struggle, the Nineteenth Amendment to the American Constitution was adopted; this Amendment is also known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. It became a law in August, 1920; it states, “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.” So, one of the most important accomplishments of the feminist movement is that women can now freely participate in the political life of American society and to an extent, global society (The Development of Women’s Rights).\n\nMany women are physically weaker than men; men also tend to be more aggressive. Combined with certain psychological and environmental factors, this fact has become one of the causes of domestic violence. According to the statistics, the vast majority of people know about the suffering of women due to domestic violence. Although men can also suffer from domestic abuse, there is a huge disproportion between the number of males and females subjected to violence at home. The feminist movement has not only drawn public attention to this issue and founded numerous organizations aimed at protecting women from their violent spouses, but also helped create legislative and legal mechanisms that would protect victims of domestic abuse (A Guide to Understanding Feminism).\n\nEnsuring that every woman has the ability to make the best decisions for herself and her family regarding reproduction is a big issue in the feminist community. This does not mean every feminist wants free abortion parties for all women, but instead being able to consider all available options without restrictions from the government or anyone else. The Center for Reproductive Rights, for example, is one group that is working to advance reproductive rights for women nationally and internationally (A Guide to Understanding Feminism).\n\nYet another positive accomplishment made by the feminist movement is that it has helped millions of women around the world regain self-confidence. Nowadays, a woman is not just a housewife or mother; women are recognized to have equal capabilities with men, and are able to achieve as much as men in professional and self-realization fields. Even the entertainment business is now promoting pro-feminist ideas; in particular, supermodel Tyra Banks organized a campaign titled “So What,” which aimed at helping women accept themselves and their imaginary or real imperfections (Divine Caroline). Other celebrities such as Beyonce, Ashton Kutcher, Joss Whedon, and Emma Watson also support and promote the ideas of feminism, helping millions of women feel proud about themselves.\n\nFeminism—in a period slightly longer than 100 years—managed to completely change the way global society saw women; not only did the gain an opportunity to participate in political and social life on the rights equal with men, but also gained legal protection from different kinds of abuse, and achieved confidence in their capabilities. These are outcomes truly worth the effort.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the most significant causes of bad mood?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If you ask someone if they would rather be in a good or in a bad mood, this person will most likely think you are weird. The majority of people obviously prefer to feel good and to be in a good mood; this is a natural desire around which the entertainment, pharmaceutical, and other industries were built. Whenever you feel down, you can find a way to increase your mood; this is effective, but not a long-lasting measure; unfortunately, rarely people seek to find and understand the reasons causing their bad mood. Knowing these reasons, people would be able to maintain and control their emotions better.\n\nSurprisingly, one of the most significant causes is what psychologists refer to as ego depletion. This idea belongs to the researcher Roy Baumeister, who believes that when people use their willpower, it drains their cognitive resources, and makes them feel worse. The more a person strives to abstain from doing something, the more annoyed their mind becomes. There is a stress threshold: at some point, when one’s willpower depletes, accumulated frustration manifests itself as anger, irritability, cynicism, and other negative emotions. In its turn, these effects increase a person’s blood pressure, as well as the levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which eventually gets a person even more flustered (Lifehacker).\n\nA more trivial but not a less important reason why you might be in a bad mood regularly or even all the time is stress caused by excessive work; being a workaholic may be beneficial for your career and reputation, but it takes its toll: you put yourself at the risk of burning out. Energy you have is a depletable resource, and learning how to manage it properly is the best way to avoid fatigue and the bad mood caused by it. There are other causes that add up to fatigue (and can be connected to working all the time): the lack of vitamins from fresh vegetables and fruit. Many people nowadays have to eat on the go, having no time to have proper, balanced meals. Consuming food should be a relaxing and pleasant process—not only stuffing one’s stomach with calories. And after all, if you have not been in direct sunlight for a while, you are guaranteed to be in a bad mood (Huffington Post).\n\nUnfortunately, among all the ways to get rid of excessive stress and bad mood, many people choose the easiest ones; some of them are more or less socially acceptable: playing video games, for example, or going to dancing clubs, and so on. However, more often people seek respite in substances such as alcohol or light drugs. Beer, all kinds of cocktails, wines, liquors, and other sorts of drinks are considered to be an easy and legal way to relax. The same refers to marijuana—since it is being legalized widely and is not considered to be a heavy drug, people smoke it to get in a better mood. However, numerous research studies prove the opposite: consuming substances like alcohol or drugs may make you feel better for a short time, but then there is necessarily a hangover, a feeling of guilt, temporary memory loss, and so on. Moreover, consuming such substances has numerous negative long-term effects (for example, mental degradation and/or addiction)—so in this perspective, these substances only make you feel worse (QuickAndDirtyTips).\n\nSo, the next time you feel your mood goes down, spend a minute to analyze your recent activities in an attempt to figure out what might be wrong. Activities that lead to the depletion of cognitive resources, fatigue and overworking, the lack of vitamins and sunlight, as well as the consumption of alcohol and other drugs can be factors you might want to eliminate in order to start feeling better.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the consequences of skipping classes?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The times when parents were responsible for their children’s academic accomplishments—and students themselves—seem to have gone. Nowadays, many people believe it is the high school administration, teachers, and the government that are responsible for students getting good grades. Before, when you got an F, your parents would blame you; today, they would rather go to your school and demand your teacher to give you a better grade. Such an approach leads to irresponsible behavior: students careless about their grades and start skipping classes, considering them to be boring. And although there is seemingly nothing wrong with skipping a boring class you think you would not need in future, in fact doing so has a number of negative impacts on your future.\n\nTo start with, parents of a student who skips school lose huge amounts of money (given that it is not the student who pays for studying). In the United States, free education is a rare privilege; every single class skipped is worth a certain amount of money. Whether a student studies at high school, college, or university, it does not matter—the average cost of a skipped class is in the range between $50 to $100 (IFR). If a student chooses to skip classes regularly, it will cost him or her or his or her parents a lot of money annually, without getting the result: education and knowledge.\n\nThe likeliness to get lower grades when skipped classes is another consequence. Whereas those who stay in class obtain at least some knowledge, even if they are not bright, a person who skips classes is at higher risks of obtaining no knowledge at all. Besides, teachers may have a bias toward such a student, and will treat him or her unfairly even though this person might be bright and studied the subject on his or her own. Needless to say, this situation can lead to a failure during exams or getting expelled from an educational institution (FRI).\n\nAccording to research, only five absences is usually enough for a student’s academic performance to drop. Five more absences would most likely lead to a decreased chance to graduate a particular educational institution: on average, skippers are about 20% less likely to successfully graduate. If a student studies at high school, he or she has a 25% less chance to enter any type of higher education institution. They are also 2.5 times more likely to have to live on welfare compared to their more disciplined peers (Middle Earth).\n\nSkipping classes has yet another not-so-obvious consequence: a student is more likely to become engaged in activities that neither the American society nor the legislative system would approve. Skipping classes does not always imply staying at home; more likely, a student would spend their time outdoors, and chances to get involved in antisocial behavior (substance abuse, shoplifting, gambling, and so on) increase. No need to say it can cause a person to enter prison eventually.\n\nSkipping classes is not so harmless as it might seem. It is a direct waste of money for all those who have to pay for the education—and such people are the majority. Students who skip classes are more likely to get lower grades and face a biased attitude from their teachers; moreover, they have lower chances to successfully graduate, and enroll in a college—of any type. Such students are also more likely to live on welfare, and get engaged in antisocial behavior. Therefore, this problem should be treated with all possible attention from teachers, parents, and authorities.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the causes of lung cancer?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Among terminal diseases humanity has not yet learned to treat, cancer is probably one of the most feared illnesses. Unlike AIDS or other diseases widely spread in countries with low standards of living, cancer’s geography is much wider, including both rich and poor countries equally. Among the variety of different types of cancer, one of the most common is lung cancer; the environment in which people live in the 21st century greatly contributes to the development of this type of cancer.\n\nThe first and the most popular cause of lung cancer is smoking cigarettes. By numerous estimates, smoking cigarettes causes approximately 86% of lung cancer cases, including cases caused by passive exposure to smoke exhaled by other smokers. These chances increase if a person started smoking tobacco at a young age. Passive smoking poses a lesser threat, but is still dangerous—it is known that passive smokers (who are usually exposed to smoke at work or at home) have a 25% higher risk of lung cancer compared to people who are not exposed to the smoke of cigarettes. Regular heavy exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can increase the risk of lung cancer by 50% (CancerResearch UK).\n\nGenetics and lung diseases in one’s genetics can also become significant risk factors of lung cancer. For example, if a person’s mother, father, sibling, aunt, uncle, or grandparent has had lung cancer, the chances of this person developing lung cancer slightly increases. At the same time, it has not been yet researched whether genes indeed increase cancer chances, or they increase individuals’ susceptibility to this disease. As for lung diseases, some of them are known to affect the chances of cancer development. In particular, among such diseases are tuberculosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Other illnesses like chronic bronchitis and emphysema can cause scarring in the lungs, which means the increase of the amount of tissue in them—and as it is known, cancer is an uncontrolled division of cells, and the respective multiplication of tissues (Healthline).\n\nAs for other environmental factors, one of the most significant among them is the exposure to asbestos fibers and similar materials. Usually, a person is exposed to these silicate materials at the workplace: technical works, such as thermal and acoustic insulation, involve the usage of asbestos. Nowadays, asbestos is limited or even prohibited from usage, since it has been proven that asbestos materials can cause both lung cancer and mesothelioma (cancer of the lungs’ pleura, as well as cancer of peritoneum—a lining of the abdominal cavity). Even non-smoking asbestos workers have a five times higher risk of developing lung cancer; as for the smoking asbestos workers, their chances to get cancer are up to ninety-fold greater than nonsmokers (MedicineNet.com).\n\nAs it can be seen, lung cancer does not develop on its own, but is triggered by a number of factors. The first and foremost of them is smoking tobacco, both active and passive. Exposure to asbestos materials also increases a person’s chances to get lung cancer. Also, genetics and past lung illnesses can lead to the development of this type of cancer. The cure for lung cancer is not finalized, and remains an epidemic.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the main complications any autistic person faces?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Mental disorders and deprivations can take countless forms. Some of them can ruin the lives of those who bear them, others are milder, and this causes almost no inconveniences to a person. Among mental disorders that do not fully incapacitate an individual, one should mention autism (although it is doubtful it can be referred to as a disorder). Though its nature and causing factors are not yet fully studied, it is not a secret that people with autism—although facing certain inconveniences regarding social integration and interaction—can live an almost normal and fulfilled life. Still, there are peculiarities and difficulties inextricably associated with autism.\n\nThe majority of problems caused by autism are more or less related to communicating with other people, understanding them, and producing effective social interaction. These problems start from childhood; children with autism tend to show more interest in environmental sounds rather than in the sound of people talking. This often makes autistic children look distracted, or not interested in what other people say. It does not mean they cannot normally communicate though: autistic individuals can use extensive vocabulary and long sentences. But at the same time, non-verbal communication, such as body language or facial expressions, is often ignored and unused by autistic individuals (The Hanen Centre). This causes them to be misunderstood.\n\nAnother problem that autistic people face is a lack of empathy. Generally speaking, empathy is an ability to understand what other people feel; according to Simon Baron-Cohen, many autistic people lack the ability to see things from another person’s perspective. People usually start to develop this skill approximately at the age of five: at this age, children can develop insights into other people’s feelings and intentions (often based, by the way, on non-verbal communication). An autist, however, has little to none of these interpretation skills, and thus remains ignorant about intentions, feelings, and motives of people surrounding him or her (Synapse). Therefore, autism not only causes other people to misunderstand an autist; it also prevents an autist from understanding surrounding people, thus only deepening the communication gap.\n\nBecause of the nature of autism, people with this disorder (or let us better call it a peculiarity) often require being surrounded by a specific environment in which they would feel comfortable to operate and interact. Autistic individuals often need rigid environments; they have a strong adherence to specific routines or rituals in daily life, and even the slightest change in them can evoke aggression or stupor and self-isolation. Autistic people often develop stereotyped and repetitive motor behaviors involving fingers, hands, or the whole body, so it is also needed that surrounding people do not mock them, parody them, or make fun of autistic person’s habits in any other way (minddisorders.com).\n\nAutism changes an individual’s life in an extremely specific way. The main complications any autistic person faces is related to communication and interaction with other people; due to the peculiarities of this disorder, for an autist, it is hard to understand other people. At the same time, other people also have problems with understanding (or normally perceiving) and autistic individual. This isolation is deepened by an autistic person’s need for a special environment and rigid conditions around them.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the causes of social anxiety disorder?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " People are exposed to huge amounts of stress each day. Problems at work, dysfunctional relationships, insurance issues, taxes, children’s misbehavior, and so on—these typical misfortunes can upset anyone. However, there is a psychological problem that can make one’s life excessively complicated even on its own, without adding up the aforementioned factors. This problem is social anxiety; unfortunately, the modern world is permeated with these factors, which contribute to the development of this psychological disorder.\n\nAlthough the environment we live in definitely has an effect on how people feel, it is important to consider the biological factors leading to social anxiety disorder (SAD). In particular, biologists believe SAD is related to a dysfunction of brain circuits responsible for regulating emotions and the “fight or flight” response center (WebMD). There is a brain structure called the amygdala; it is known to play a role in controlling the fear response. If a person has an overactive amygdala, they often display an excessive “fear” type of emotional response; therefore, whenever a situation occurs that can be interpreted as even slightly uncomfortable, a person with SAD will overreact in terms of fear (Mayo Clinic). In addition, genetic factors should also be considered when studying the causes of SAD, because social anxiety may occur when it was also present in a first-degree relative: parent, sibling, or child.\n\nAnother significant group of factors responsible for the development of SAD is a group of environmental factors, including psychological climates. The first social interactions people make in their lives are usually connected to parents; from them, people learn basic social rules, what is acceptable and what is not, how it is like to be loved and to be ignored, and so on. Based on what happened in their childhood, people construct their personal systems of beliefs, including assumptions on what other people think about them. Commonly, if a child is loved and respected by parents, he or she later assumes that other people treat them in the same way; however, if a child is often criticized, it prevents him or her from developing a sense of personal value, and for such people, it is more difficult to become socially confident (Overcoming).\n\nIn addition, the way parents deal with different life situations also influences children’s personality. According to Cheryl Carmin, a psychiatrist and director of the clinical psychology training program at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, parents are often responsible for developing social anxiety in a child. “A parent or a significant adult figure may model that it’s appropriate to be anxious in situations where your performance will be evaluated […]. For example, a parent who is commenting on being nervous about a performance review or who tells their child to not be anxious before their first “show and tell” may be priming the child to, in fact, be anxious in that situation. It’s also quite possible that any number of these factors interact,” says Dr. Carmin (Live Science).\n\nThe reasons why people develop social anxiety are different, but generally they can be divided into two categories: biological and environmental. A biological group of reasons includes dysfunctions in brain work, as well as excessive “fight or flight” reactions. Environmental factors include psychological influences caused by parents on their children, as well as the models that parents provide in the form of teaching their children consciously or unconsciously.###"}

However, this advice is pointless, because there are objective reasons why people lose homes and jobs, and why they cannot return to normal life.\n\nOne of the most frequent causes of homelessness is property-destroying disasters of any kind. It can be an earthquake (like in Japan in 2011), a hurricane (like in New Orleans), a flood or tsunami, and so on. At the same time, it can be a disaster or accident of a smaller scale, but still a significant one. Domestic fires, for example, destroy hundreds of residences annually; usually, if a brigade of firefighters does not manage to arrive on time, people suffer severe material damage. Left without a home, victims of these disasters also often lose their IDs, property documents, credit cards, cash stashes, and so on. It can take months (or even years) to renew them. And friends and relatives are not always willing or capable of helping a victim during the time he or she recuperates (IFR).\n\nAnother group of factors leading to homelessness includes unhappy marriages and their outcomes. Divorce and abusive relationships are among the major factors of homelessness (Homeless Resource Network). In particular, divorce can often leave one of the spouses homeless. When divorcing, former family members usually try to divide the property they acquired in marriage; in some cases, one of the spouses can find themselves deprived of any property, including a place to live in. Another possible reason for homelessness is domestic violence. Although it is usually considered that women suffer from domestic violence more than men, it is not true; as a result, a number of people of both genders prefer to live on the streets rather than stay in abusive relationships.\n\nThe institutional backgrounds of people can cause them to end up living on the streets (Shelter). In particular, people who served in the armed forces and participated in war conflicts can suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, which can prevent them from fitting into normal life, living with their families, and so on. As a result, they are at risk of not being able to get along with the peaceful environment around them, and end up on the streets. Another group of people who can potentially become homeless are former prisoners. A prisoner does not necessarily remain a villain after getting out of jail; moreover, such people could have committed some minor crimes, or even were unjustly convicted. Still, non-criminal citizens usually do not give them a second chance, so they often become homeless as well.\n\nIt is obvious that homelessness is caused not only by a person’s unwillingness to work and sustain themselves; rather often, there exist objective factors causing people to become homeless. Among them, one should mention disasters (both natural and human-caused), divorce, abusive relationships, PTSD, and non-conducive backgrounds like being a former convict.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the reasons why poverty is still present in the world?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Although our world is developing at a rapid rate in terms of technology, and many problems of the 20th century have been solved, there still are issues that humanity cannot deal with. Among such challenges as hunger, wars, natural disasters, and pollution, poverty is one of the most significant problems; in fact, it is a scourge of many developing countries. Therefore, understanding and eliminating the reasons of why poverty is still present in the world is important.\n\nWhen analyzing such a global issue, one should consider historical and cultural factors. Nations that are among the poorest in the world were once colonies, or areas from which richer countries exported slaves; also, some of these territories were drained of resources. Rare exceptions like Canada or Australia do not deny the fact that, for example, almost the entire continent of Africa is a problematic area in terms of poverty and hunger. This happened due to the fact that colonialism contributed to the establishment of conditions where people living in former colonies cannot access capital or education. In addition, there exist several hot spots in the world where wars and political instability also cause a significant decrease in the quality of life: Syria, Egypt, Ukraine, and so on (The Borgen Project).\n\nPerhaps the most direct causal link exists between poverty and the balance between a country’s population density and its agricultural capabilities. Although such countries as the Netherlands or Belgium have a high density of population, their agricultural industry is based on mechanized farming and high-tech solutions, so poverty and hunger have no chance there. The same refers to other technologically-advanced countries. In contrast, Bangladesh, which has one of the world’s largest population densities (2,791 persons in a square mile) exists on the edge of extreme poverty—mostly because the majority of population is involved in low-efficient manual farming. On the other hand, there are countries in Africa with only about 80 persons per square mile, but because of low soil fertility, and the use of manual labor, these countries cannot boost their productivity and development (povertyhci.weebly.com).\n\nAlong with objective poverty factors, it is also important to consider social factors—in particular, psychological traits that many poor people possess. In many developed countries, poor people do not try to improve their financial conditions, relying on welfare payments provided to them by governments (CliffsNotes). Due to the lack of education and skills (also caused by the inability to pay for them), they cannot work at well-paid jobs, although they can still become maids, cleaners, postal workers, couriers, and so on. Doing so would enable such people to earn more money necessary for education and personal development, but they prefer to keep the status quo.\n\nReasons of poverty are numerous, and it is difficult to analyze the entire complex of causes of such a global issue. However, some of them are obvious: a colonial background, wars and political instability, dense population combined with low agricultural capabilities, and certain psychological traits of poor people. These factors help keep poverty in the world’s list of the most urgent problems.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the dangers of teenagers being sexually active?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The theme and reality of teenagers being sexually active is worrying to millions of parents worldwide. In the age of adolescence, when an individual transits from childhood to adult life, hormones, extensive body development, social frustration, and a search for themselves causes teenagers to try all kinds of things they associate with adult life, authority, and self-affirmation; sex is usually one of the “adult” attributions teenagers often try out. Although it is natural and inevitable, there are hidden dangers connected to teenagers starting their sexual life too early, which both them and their parents should be aware of.\n\nThe least obvious negative effect of sex is depression. According to studies by Ad-Health, more than 25% of sexually-active teenage girls reported they were depressed most of the time—compared to only 7.7% of depressed female teenagers who did not have sex yet. Logically, something connected to sex must have been worrying these 25% of girls. At the same time, about 8.3% of sexually-active male teenagers reported depression—compared to 3.4% of their sexually-inactive peers. But even more worrying is the direct link between early sexual activity and attempted suicides. About 14% of sexually-active female teenagers reported they attempted suicide at least once (compared to about 5% percent of sexually-inactive girls). The respective percentage for boys is 6% against 0.7%. Thus, early sexual experience can be not only depressing, but also dangerous to the sustainability of lives (The Heritage Foundation).\n\nTeenagers who start leading sexual life too early are exposed to higher risks of developing different kinds of sex, love, and/or relationship addictions. According to research, early exposure to, for example, pornography, can become a significant factor of a teen developing sexual addictions or other intimacy disorders (although it is not necessarily so). According to a study (in which 932 sex addicts had participated), about 90% of men and 77% of women reported pornography to be a factor in their addiction. Nowadays, considering that pornography has become free and available in a couple of clicks, parents should pay much more attention to the matter of preserving their children from its negative influences (Psychology Today). In addition, early sexual life can lead to emotional addictions, co-dependencies, abusive relationships, and other hardships.\n\nAccording to the statistics, teenagers in the U.S. become sexually active at approximately the same age as their counterparts from European (and/or other) developed countries. At the same time, teens in the U.S. tend to use condoms and other forms of protection less often; in fact, the rate of contraceptive usage among American teenagers is the lowest in the world. As a result, the teenage pregnancy rate in the U.S. is twice as high as the respective rates in England, France, or Canada (Glowm). Besides, the problem of sexually-transmitted diseases also remains glaring; since U.S. teenagers do not bother themselves using contraceptives, the rate of STDs among them is incredibly high: about 8,000 U.S. teenagers become infected every day (The Heritage Foundation).\n\nAlthough sexual life is seen by teenagers as one of the necessary attributes of adulthood, it poses a number of significant dangers for those who have started it too early. Teenagers who have become sexually active at a young age are more likely to become depressed or attempt suicide; they are more exposed to different kinds of sexual and intimacy disorders, emotional addictions, abusive relationships, and so on. Such teens are also at risk of becoming pregnant too early, or becoming infected by an STD. Therefore, teenagers should be explained the respective dangers, and parents should pay more attention to their children’s behavior and health.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the positive and negative effects of the Chinese One-child Policy?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In the 21st century, the majority of problems that scourged humanity for centuries have been pacified by science and medicine. Diseases are being successfully cured; famine does not occur in the majority of developed countries; wars are no longer global. These, as well as other reasons, caused the extensive growth of population all over the world. One of the most overpopulated regions in the world is China, where the amount of people is close to 1.4 billion. In an attempt to avoid problems connected with overpopulation, the Chinese government in 1978 adopted the One-child Policy, which restricted each family to have more than one child (nowadays, exceptions are allowed due to reforms). However, although it helped to some extent, this policy also had a number of unforeseen consequences.\n\nIt is not clear which of the positive effects of the One-child Policy had been planned in advance, but one of them is the dramatic improvement of the financial status of many Chinese families. “Every family suddenly had a huge amount of discretionary income to invest in education and also in consumption,” says sociologist Vanessa Fong of Amherst College in Massachusetts. In past generations, resources were spread between many children; nowadays, families’ resources are concentrated on one child. As a result, Chinese parents can afford sending children to foreign colleges for studying, buy and consume more goods (thus moving the economy forward), and so on. As a result, China’s singletons, as they are called, are much more educated than generations before them (BBC).\n\nAt the same time, the implementation of the One-child Policy before reforms led to a number of horrifying violations of human rights all across China, and especially in rural regions. There were numerous stories about coercive practices of forced late-term abortions, when the community insisted on a woman being pregnant with a second child to get rid of it. There were reports about involuntary sterilizations; this was combined with the practice of whistleblowing, when people reported about their neighbors who dared to conceive a second child (Newsweek). Nowadays, the situation has improved due to a number of amendments made in this policy; but a couple of decades ago, the situation was much worse.\n\nYet another negative effect is the 4-2-1 problem. In China, a child takes care of his or her parents (and grandparents, if they are still alive) when they become an adult. In the times when there were many children in a family, this was not an issue; however, nowadays a grownup singleton must take care of two parents, and four grandparents—including financial support, health care, and so on. Considering that by 2050, the amount of senior citizens (65 years old or older) are expected to be more than a quarter of the whole population of China, it is not hard to imagine the excessive burden of family responsibilities that each singleton will have to face (IO9).\n\nThe notorious Chinese One-child Policy has lead to a number of controversial effects. On one side, modern Chinese young men and women (born after 1978) are more educated than previous generations, as families can focus all their incomes on one child; also, the rates of consumption of various goods have increased. At the same time, the process of this policy’s implementation was accompanied with horrible violations of human rights, which stopped only with reforms and amendments to the policy. Also, children born under the policy will have to face an excessive burden of taking care after old parents and relatives—all on their own.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the reasons for children's misbehavior?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Children are one of the biggest treasures for married couples—this is what many happy families would say when asked about children. Indeed, raising children can give a new meaning to the life of many parents. But at the same time, having a child often has a number of problems that inexperienced parents might have to deal with; one of such problems is a child’s misbehavior—at school, at home, or wherever else. Rather often, adults do not bother themselves with trying to understand why their child misbehaves; at the same time, these causes may be much more serious than just child’s play or hyperactivity.\n\nOne of the main tasks when being a child is to figure out how the complex world around you works. This world includes different relationships—with parents, in particular. At each developmental level, children learn what is acceptable in relationships with other people, and what is not—they are trying to see where the boundaries are (if any). This makes a child constantly break the silence, so to say: shout, fight, be rude, or misbehave in any other way—each case is particular. This may be frustrating for parents, who might start thinking their child has gone crazy or is possessed by evil spirits all of the sudden, but in fact it is normal and necessary for a child. During such periods, all parents can do is set the boundaries and limits and consistently follow them (Lifehack.org).\n\nIt may be hard to believe, especially for parents who already experience complications with their child’s misbehavior, but sometimes the reason for a child’s rioting may be his or her lack of skills. A child with a lack of social and communication skills may hit another child, not clean his or her room (sometimes because he or she is not sure what to do when his or her toys do not fit in the toy box). In this case, parents are required to teach their children skills, the lack of which leads to troubles. By showing a misbehaving child alternatives to misbehavior, parents can make him or her calm down, learn from his or her mistakes, and acquire new skills (About Parenting).\n\nPerhaps not a pleasant one, but still a reason: sometimes, children do not know how to draw their parents’ attention to them other than misbehaving, as parents do not grant them with enough warmth and love. Such misbehavior can be a sort of revenge. Such children may find attention in being mean, vicious, and violent, and thus making their parents feel bad. The solution here might be to try giving the child what they need: comfort, love, care, attention (KidsGrowth.com).\n\nChildren’s misbehavior is not a temporary phenomenon that can be explained by children’s penchant for pranks. Children may misbehave due to serious reasons, such as trying to figure out what is acceptable and unacceptable in the relationships between people (and learning from this experience); the lack of skills: communication, problem-solving, and so on; also, misbehavior can be a form of revenge for a child who feels abandoned and not loved. In each particular case of children’s misbehavior, parents should figure out the reasons standing behind it.###"}
{"prompt": "How does social media affect family relationships?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A family has, at most times, been seen as private territory. No matter what happened outside of it—for example, at work or elsewhere—a family, in principle, is where many people can share their problems, seek for solutions together, enjoy understanding and privacy. However, as technologies have become more and more advanced, this private, intimate space has shrunk. Today, in the era of social media, relationships in many families have changed, since social media affects these relationships in a number of unexpected and sometimes negative ways.\n\nLooking from an optimistic perspective, children and parents have gained a powerful tool of communication. Indeed, while communicating in person might be difficult for both teenagers and their parents during the “teenage rioting” period, social networks provide a valuable opportunity for communication. However, there is another side of the coin. About 30% of people are now using all kinds of gadgets, including cell phones, tablets, and so on, to talk to their loved ones through social media services, instead of having a conversation with them in person. One person out of five admitted they learned what their family members were doing by checking their statuses online, not by asking them personally—even though they might be sitting in the next room (Macleighob).\n\nMoreover, a study on media influence done by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that young people from the age of 8 to 18 years tend to spend about seven hours a day using entertainment media, which makes a total of approximately 50 hours per week. This means that during this time, they are not exercising, hanging out, communicating with their families, or getting involved in intimate relationships. Such a lifestyle makes them gain extra weight, get easily distracted, and develop difficulties in establishing interpersonal relationships, including the relationships with parents, siblings, and other family members. The study suggests such young people often tend to be mentally absent when being with a group of friends or family (Huffington Post).\n\nYet another problem originating from social media is the real lack of privacy within families. When there is a conflict, fight, regular problem, or even a happy event, one (and sometimes both) of the spouses occasionally post about it on Facebook, or share this information with the public in some other way. This leads to a transparency of relationships, and thus its vulnerability; also, one of the spouses might be frustrated by the fact that intimate details of their family life are being exposed to a large number of unfamiliar people. This leads to additional conflicts, further posting about these conflicts in social media, and thus creates an endless cycle of problems (IFR).\n\nSocial media possess many useful features, but in the case of family relationships, these media services should be used with caution. According to different studies, teenagers widely using social media tend to communicate with their family members in person much less often. They may face difficulties connected to social adaptation and acceptance, as well as excessive body weight and communication problems. Also, social media may be used by family members to share the intimate details of family life with public; this can be frustrating for family members.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the negative consequences of water pollution?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Industrial development and production in western first-world countries has long ago reached the level where it is possible to dramatically affect the environment. Among such industry-related problems as air pollution, soil contamination, radioactive waste, and so on, the problem of low-quality water stands as one of the most pertinent in terms of its importance for the survival of humankind. Therefore, information about the negative effects of water pollution should be not only studied, but spread among the general populous, taken into consideration, and prevented.\n\nOne of the most significant problems connected to poor water quality is that entire food chains are drastically affected or even become extinct due to increased toxicity. Such pollutants as lead or cadmium get into water, and contaminate microorganisms living in it. These microorganisms are consumed by larger species—such as plankton—which, in their turn, are eaten by even larger animals, and so on. Eventually, this chain leads to human beings, because people all over the world consume fish and seafood. Thus, by polluting oceans, people worsen their overall well being (ESchoolToday).\n\nAnother problem connected to the contamination of water is the disruption of entire ecosystems. An ecosystem is the way of interaction between creatures that inhabit a certain area, and thus depend on each other. But, water pollution can severely damage the subtle connections between the living species inhabiting certain environmental areas (ESchoolToday). This, in its turn, leads to an increasing imbalance in the environment, causing species to become extinct; every time an ecosystem suffers, it also affects the condition of our planet in general, and thus, people living on it.\n\nPerhaps the most significant damage from water pollution is connected to humans. For instance, diseases like hepatitis are caused by eating contaminated seafood; developing countries, which often have problems with the quality of water, experience frequent outbreaks of cholera or diphtheria. If you swim in polluted water, it can cause you to develop skin diseases, reproductive problems, typhoid fever, and so on. Moreover, sometimes it can cause heavy metals or pesticide poisoning, because polluted water often contains mercury, plumbum, insecticide, herbicides, and so on (TutorVista.com).\n\nAs it can be seen, water pollution leads to a number of serious, negative consequences. It destroys animal species that inhabit seas and oceans, and disrupts existing food chains. Water pollution also affects ecosystems in a negative way, destroying them and thus affecting the ecological situation on Earth. These two factors have an indirect, but strong effect on humanity. As for the direct effects, polluted water causes people to suffer from cholera, diphtheria, skin diseases, reproductive problems, poisoning, and so on. All of this means that humanity should pay attention to the problem of water contamination, otherwise it will continue to severely hurt itself.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the reasons that prevent women from leaving abusive relationships?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Falling in love with a person is, perhaps, one of the most important events in a person’s life. Many people who fall in love marry each other, and many break up or get divorced. But some of them are unlucky to get trapped in an abusive relationship; traditionally, it is considered that women suffer from abusive relationships more often than men, and are less likely to leave them. Sometimes, women suffer from abuse for decades, without being able to break up with their tormentors; and although it may seem that breaking up would be the most natural and logical act, there are reasons that prevent women from doing so.\n\nIn many cases, women feel they cannot leave an abusive relationship because they have gotten used to abusive behavior since childhood, so they do not see violence as something that is out of order. Unfortunately, dysfunctional families, in which emotional, physical, economical, or other kinds of abuse are routine, are not uncommon nowadays. Women coming from such families do not know other patterns of behavior, and thus have learned to expect frequent incidents of violence (Women’s Web). Habits and psychological traits gained in childhood remain incredibly strong throughout one’s lifetime, so there is no wonder why women raised in dysfunctional families do not attempt to quit abusive relationships. Thus, in order to do so, they might need respective psychological assistance first.\n\nRather often, victims of domestic abuse do not stay for the pain; it would be illogical, unless they were masochistic. What makes women stay with abusers is they hope one day the violence will stop. Not all of the abusers are cruel and sadistic; often, they realize they have insulted and/or hurt their partner. Sincerely feeling guilty, abusers try to make amends, comfort their victim, and this is what gives women hope for the better. They tend to block out evidence to the contrary, believing “this very case of abuse definitely was the last.” In fact, many abuse victims prefer to notice only the positive traits in their partners, such as being affectionate and reliable, and justify the cases of violent behavior. In one study, more than 50% of the abuse victims believed their partners were “highly dependable” (Huffington Post).\n\nIt would also be a mistake to underestimate financial and health factors. For example, due to the lack of money, it can seem impossible for some abuse victims to leave, traumatizing the relationship. Even if they could, they might have no place to go; this causes a strong feeling of helplessness, which causes a victim to think they would rather live with the abusive partner than take a leap into the unknown. Also, a woman might be disabled or ill, thus being physically dependent on the abuser; this dependency often influences a woman’s decision to stay in an abusive relationship (Love Is Respect).\n\nAs we can see, it is not easy to leave abusive relationships, because along with violence come numerous factors that prevent women from leaving abusive relationships. Among these factors, one should mention having a dysfunctional family in a victim’s background; permanent hope that the abuse will stop, along with psychological dependency on the abuser; and financial or health factors that prevent the victim from leaving the abuser. These factors should be considered before providing help to a victim of an abusive relationship.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the major factors leading to pollution?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Among the problems that worry modern humanity the most, pollution is one of the most worrisome. Though in the recent decades, people—especially in western countries such as the U.S., Canada, and in European countries—have become more conscious about ecology, the overall situation has not changed for the better. The present prominence of pollution has happened due to a number of major factors that have significantly spoiled the environment and decreased the outcomes of people’s efforts to make our planet a cleaner place.\n\nThe first and foremost factor leading to pollution is industrial production—this includes excavating fossils and raw materials from the depths of the planet, as well as their further refinement, and emissions from factories and energy plants, such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and organic compounds. In particular, petroleum, which is refined from fossils, in its process of refinement, releases hydrocarbons and other chemicals that pollute the air and soil (Conserve Energy Future). Refineries and factories are allocated all around the world, and the excavation of fossils is crucial for civilization to exist, so the scales of pollution caused by industry are—and possibly will remain—enormous.\n\nLivestock farming and timber production are the second major reason why pollution keeps spreading around the planet. The modern agricultural sector consumes vast amounts of resources, at the same time producing tons of waste. For example, in order to grow cereal and other plants, extremely harmful fertilizers are being used widely. These chemicals affect the environment, as well as human health, in a negative way. In addition, timber production causes global deforestation, and this leads directly to the increase of the carbon dioxide share in the atmosphere (Tropical-Rainforest-Animals).\n\nYet another factor of environmental pollution is what is usually called household chemicals. Many people unconsciously contribute to massive atmosphere pollution without even knowing it. Fumigating homes, household cleaning products and painting supplies, insect and pest repellents, refrigerator liquids, deodorants, hairspray, and other similar products pollute air every day (ESchoolToday).\n\nAs we can see, all of the major pollution factors are connected to the results of human activity. Industrial production and consumption, the excavation and refinement of fossils, agriculture and timber production, as well as household chemicals, pollute the environment greatly. The control of pollution is in our hands—we now have the great responsibility to restore our planet back to normalcy.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the risk factors for developing depression?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Living in the 21st century, apart from various commodities and products of technological progress, implies facing serious challenges. Among them, one can name global warming, third-world country hunger and poverty, nuclear weapons, cancer, and so on; one of such issues that poses a significant threat to modern people is depression. Depression has become one of the most widespread illnesses, which can be explained by a combination of factors typical for the modern world’s lifestyle.\n\nThe first—and surprising—risk factor for developing depression is gender. About 20-25% women in the United States develop serious depression, sometimes not just once in their lives; for comparison, only about 12% of male Americans face the same problem—or maybe, they visit a doctor’s office less often (All About Depression.com). This is probably connected to the fact that in today’s America, women often have to deal with a wide range of roles, such as business woman, mother, wife, housekeeper, and so on—and these roles often conflict with each other. Unhappy marriages, hormonal changes, and heredity can be contributing factors.\n\nAnother group of factors that lead to depression are different psychological problems. Most often, low self-esteem is the major cause, since it makes a person treat themselves with neglect, prevent them from believing in their own strengths, and see the world pessimistically. Other possible psychological reasons are stress, perfectionism, chronic anxiety, avoidant personality disorders, and so on (PsychCentral).\n\nPersonal factors, such as complicated life situations, a tragic family history, childhood traumas, living in stressful environments for a long time, and other similar life circumstances can garner depressive conditions. Genetic proneness is also related to this group of causes. At the same time, it does not mean that a person will automatically develop depression if he or she had cases of depression in their family, or they are in a complicated life situation. This group of factors mostly creates premises, and is commonly combined with other risk factors (Beyond Blue).\n\nAlcohol, by the way, is as strong of a cause of depression as genetic factors or psychological problems. Although it is usually considered that alcohol helps people get rid of stress, and increase their communication, in fact it is a depressant that increases a person’s chances to develop depression (femah.net).\n\nThese are not the only possible causes of depression, but commonly, this disorder is caused by an aggregate of the factors described above. It is likely that women develop depression more often than men; also, people with psychological problems and complicated personal circumstances are more prone to developing depression. The usage of alcohol not only does not help people get rid of stress, but on the contrary, increases the risks of developing depression. These factors should be taken into account in one’s daily life in order to avoid depression.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the three major reasons for lower back pain?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Technological progress has made numerous operations people perform on a daily basis much simpler. Compared to the living standards of several centuries ago, physical security is almost promised nowadays. This, as well as other factors, has caused significant changes in lifestyles, namely decreased physical activity. New working and living conditions have also caused an amount of widespread health problems which, most likely, were unfamiliar to previous generations. One of such issues is consistent lower back pain.\n\nOne of the typical reasons why people have pain in their lower back is root nerve pain. It is usually caused by the nerve root being irritated or mechanically pressed on (Patient.co.uk). This happens, for example, in the case of a so-called prolapsed spine disc, when the soft inner part of a spinal disc bulges off the external part, which is harder, and presses on the nerve. In its turn, this condition can be caused by numerous factors, such as severe physical effort, repeatedly being in a wrong body position, having a sedentary lifestyle, and so on.\n\nAnother reason for lower back pain is what is usually called lumbar strain. Basically, this term means lower back muscles, tendons, or ligaments have undergone a stretching injury, causing microscopic tears in these tissues (MedicineNet.com). This malady can occur to people of any age, and manifests itself as pain ranged from mild to severe. Commonly, lumbar strain happens to people who fell, got hit, or experienced other traumatizing affections on the lower back area.\n\nPerhaps the most common and, so to say, natural reason why people get pain in the lower back is degenerative processes. The spine (of which the lower back section always undergoes the most intense loads, like supporting body weight, lifting masses, and so on) consists of about 30 vertebrae, bones, and a spongy matter called “spine discs.” As a person gets older, and considering the constant loads on the lower back, this spongy matter between vertebrae wears off and becomes more stiff (WebMD). This causes the discs to become more vulnerable to traumas. In addition, such diseases as osteochondrosis and scoliosis also cause mild and severe pain in different sections of the spine, including the lower back.\n\nConsidering the above mentioned reasons, it is clear lower back pain is often related to the type of physical loads the spine receives constantly. The three major factors causing lower back problems are connected to mechanical influences and degenerative processes, so it is crucial for any individual to keep an eye on what actions he or she does and how he or she completes actions to avoid traumatizing the spine or spinal discs.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the negative effects of reality TV shows?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If a person turns their TV on in almost any country, most likely the channels will be filled with different kinds of reality shows. This is no surprise, because this kind of TV program has become amazingly popular in recent decades. Such shows are entertaining and addicting to watch, as they focus not on fictional characters, but on real people put in different contexts and situations. However, regardless of the entertainment it delivers, a question may arise: is there something more to watching reality shows than being entertained?\n\nWhen evaluating reality shows, several factors should be taken in consideration. The “reality” that is usually shown on TV is not the same objective reality we live in. Every reality show has a core idea to which the behavior of its contestants is subdued—though the participants are not obliged to act one way or another, they still follow the script, and their behavior is then evaluated (by audiences, other show participants, moderators, and so on). “All TV shows, not just reality shows, help construct scenarios that demonstrate how some behaviors will be rewarded or punished. The concern is that frequent viewers of these shows will learn these behaviors, see them as desirable and then model them in the actual real world,” says Dr. Brad Gorham, chair of the Communications Department at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University (USA Today).\n\nIf we try to figure out what is so entertaining about reality shows, we can reach this conclusion: it is the humiliation and mocking of the contestants that makes people amused. Indeed, if we analyze such a popular show as American Idol, we will easily notice many episodes of this program are dedicated to making fun of the contestants, whose performing abilities were lower compared to other participants (which does not necessarily mean they are deprived of talent, or are worse in any other way). This can create an audience (which mostly consists of teenagers) that rate and assess people based on their qualities, such as appearance or skills; this model forms a solid basis for discriminating behavior and a lack of tolerance (eHow).\n\nYet another negative effect of reality shows is a distorted depiction of relationships between genders. Many reality shows address sexual themes, or depict relationships based on scandals and fights. Relationships on TV contrast real life ones: they tend to be less stable and harmonious, they are sexualized, and usually aimed at bringing more popularity to those engaged in them. Since it is difficult to control the access of underaged audiences to TV programs, children and teenagers are exposed to the risks of developing a wrong perception of relationships based on what they see on TV, which is unacceptable (RFA.edu).\n\nEven though reality shows have become extremely popular, it does not mean they are beneficial for their audiences. Rather often, these shows display role models that are based on semi-artificial circumstances and environments. However, these models are still seen as desirable by viewers. In addition, humiliation, which makes the basis of the entertainment component in the majority of reality shows, teaches audiences to rate people based on their physical or psychological qualities, which can create a solid basis for discriminating behavior. In addition, considering sexualized and simplified depictions of romantic relationships in reality shows, one can claim these TV programs can cause perverted perceptions of relationships between different genders in the minds of teenagers, who usually make up the target audience of the majority of reality shows.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the positive effects of having faith in divinity?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Since the time scientific discoveries had proven some religious dogmas to be flawed, humanity became divided in two opposite camps: believers and atheists. Though religion and following its dogmas is not equal to the faith in God, by majority, people still tend either to concede to divine forces, or to explain the state of the Universe with the laws of nature, physics, or evolution; compromises are rare. At the same time, believers (regardless of their confession) seem to be different from atheists in terms of the positive effects they experience due to having faith in divinity.\n\nPerhaps one of the most important and miraculous effects of faith in divine powers is that believers display increased longevity, lower blood pressure, and improved mental health, compared to those who have no faith in God (Liberty Magazine). In particular, according to a nationwide study held in the United States between 1987 and 1995, believers enjoyed an average of seven additional years of life; they also had fewer chances to have hypertension, and manifested lower rates of depression and anxiety.\n\nFaith in divinity changes people’s attitude towards life in general, themselves, and other people. In particular, believers tend to be more optimistic; they often expect assistance from higher powers, and this gives them strength and hope to undertake life difficulties with dignity and endurance (CAFSurveys). Psychologists emphasize that such an approach allows people to pay less attention to the negative sides of life without ignoring them: fortunes and beneficial opportunities are seen as divine help, whereas difficulties and problems are faced with persistence and a hope for the best.\n\nBeing a believer not only effects an individuals’ health or mental well-being, but also their social life. According to a study conducted by the Grey Matter Research team, when asked about religion’s impact on the decrease of amounts of crime and poverty in society in general, or the decline in rates of violence, 45, 41, and 39 percent of respondents respectively thought religion has a positive impact on these processes in terms of regulating and minimizing them (Grey Matter).\n\nFaith in divinity, regardless of a religion, is able to cause surprising positive effects on its bearers. Regardless of what religion people belong to, they experience the same benefits from having faith. In particular, believers have longer lives, lower blood pressure, and lower rates of anxiety and depression. They also tend to hope for the best even in complicated life situations, and face difficulties with persistence and optimism. In addition, religion has a regulative and minimizing effect on such social phenomena as violence, crime, and poverty. Hence, being a believer seems to grant people with extra benefits without extra effort.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the detrimental effects of beauty pageants?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Competition can be fairly called one of the main motivators, as well as one of the main organizing principles for individuals. It affects many spheres of life: employment, work performance, global marketing, education, creativity and arts, even entertainment. A bright example of the latter is beauty contests; despite their purely entertaining nature, they can be harmful or even dangerous in terms of setting inappropriate beauty standards, encouraging to evaluate people by their appearance, and affecting public opinion negatively.\n\nThe most obvious detrimental effect of beauty pageants is enforcing an inappropriate body perception for men and women. Unlike the majority of “average” women, the beauty of such contests’ participants is cherished and rehearsed; this is the case when natural beauty is heavily supported by the efforts of visagistes and dressers. Though pageants represent the absolute minority of the society, their appearances set high, unrealistic standards for how women of all ages should look like (Miss America). Young girls who try to live up to these standards, mature women complexing about their bodies, men who demand their wives/girlfriends to look like beauty pageant participants—all of them are affected by the illusions propagated by beauty contests.\n\nAnother perception issue arises from the very nature of beauty contests—the objectification of women. Despite proclaimed gender equality, physical attractiveness (including sexual) remains one of the major requirements for women today (FAR). No matter how progressive and tolerant people strive to be, they still make their first impression about other people by their appearance, and this is natural. However, the idea of beauty contests implies evaluating women solely on their physical shape, ignoring all other aspects of individuality. Interviewing, meant to show a contestants personality, is a fraud; as one of the former pageants wrote, none of the judges wanted to hear about deep problems, asking about the most challenging childhood experiences (Generation Progress). This turns a woman into a media object, or even a product, that can be assessed and then either approved or rejected; due to the popularity of beauty contests, such an attitude is being widely propagated.\n\nHealth problems among the younger generation is yet another negative effect caused by beauty contests. Skinny models performing in such shows have undergone years of exercising and diets—they have developed special lifestyles to maintain their perfect shape; on the other hand, adolescent girls striving to look “better” exhaust themselves with hunger, considering it to be the main method to becoming slim (FAR). Such an attitude often leads to anorexia and other related psychological problems; because of the continuous influence of media-created images of the “perfect shape,” the number of young women with anorexia remains high.\n\nThe idea of beauty contests implies competing in physical attractiveness. Ignoring the absurdity of this idea, a number of detrimental effects caused by such contests still needs to be emphasized. Beauty contests set unrealistic standards of beauty, which lower women’s self-esteem and increase the demands of men for their wives or girlfriends. Beauty contests objectify women, turning them into a product that can be assessed based solely on its appearance. In addition, beauty pageants influence the minds of adolescents, often resulting in anorexia and other psychological disorders.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the most common reasons for adolescent suicides?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " To live means not only to exist biologically or as a psychic entity, but also to cope with difficulties, interact and communicate with people, make decisions, and sometimes undergo excessive psychological pressure. Even an adult mind can fail to maintain pressure, making an individual see no other solution but suicide. Along with this, a risk group that is even more exposed to suicides is represented by teenagers, who are more vulnerable to stresses and usually do not possess strongly-shaped personalities. According to the statistics, suicide is the second leading cause of death (after motor vehicle accidents) among teenagers (CHealth); this makes about 1 of 10000 people. Considering the problem’s scales, factors that cause adolescents to do away with themselves should be distinguished.\n\nOne of the most common reasons for adolescent suicide is a divorce of parents, as well as a new family formation—including step-parents, step-siblings, and so on (CHealth). According to the study of 146 adolescent friends of 26 adolescent suicide victims, teenagers who lived in single-parent families were more likely either to commit suicide and to have psychological disorders compared to children from complete families; more precisely, three of four adolescent suicides were committed by children raised in single-parent households (Lists101).\n\nDepression can be another reason for teenagers committing suicides. Scientists usually connect the development of depression to the lack of the brain chemical serotonin, which controls impulses; this is important considering the fact that many suicides are committed impulsively (NAMI). Moreover, symptoms of depression can also serve as warning signs of a teen having suicidal thoughts. Among the most common signs parents or caregivers should pay attention to: sudden changes of eating and sleeping habits; withdrawal from friends and family members; giving up favorite activities; lack of response to praise; alcohol and drug use; suicidal feelings, and so on. Statements about wanting to die or hints like “I won’t be a problem much longer” should also be paid extra attention (The Ohio State University).\n\nYet another common reason for adolescent suicides is unsuccessful love. Teenagers are vulnerable due to the complexities of a transitional period between adolescence and adulthood. They also tend to maximize and generalize certain events of their lives. Thus, a breakup or unrequited love, which themselves are rather complicated conundrums, may be seen as a total disaster, and thus push a teen towards making a final decision for a temporary problem.###"}
{"prompt": "What are some of the negative effects of laziness?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Sometimes, an urge to rest passively is overwhelming; the most common reason for this is fatigue, as the fast pace of metropolitan life requires people to push themselves to the limit on a daily basis. In such cases, there is nothing wrong with a wish to spend several calm hours doing nothing. However, there is a category of people whose entire lifestyle can be described by the slang phrase “couch potato.” Mostly, such people prefer to act as passive spectators of life, and though the masses do not consider laziness to be significant misconduct—treating it mostly as a forgivable weakness—this personality trait can cause severe negative effects both on an individual and on his or her surroundings.\n\nA definition provided by Oxford Dictionaries describes laziness as the quality of being unwilling to work or use energy; and while unwillingness to work seems to affect only one sphere of an individual’s life—his or her career—having no intention to spend one’s energy seems to have a negative impact in multiple areas.\n\nLaziness negatively affects an individual’s relationships with their boss and/or colleagues, due to certain behavioral standards that lazy people usually develop at work. In particular, lazy people tend to handover their work to someone else, often because of knowing that other people are more responsible workers and will accomplish additional tasks anyways; lazy people often procrastinate, justifying themselves by various reasons, or getting distracted by less important and more enjoyable tasks; besides, lethargic individuals develop a habit of complaining about their circumstances, or to put themselves in a favorable light and show that they work harder than their colleagues, but are undervalued (LifePaths 360). These, as well as other behavioral patterns usually result into the loss of a job, with the followup of anxiety, depression, and other psychic disturbances. In this case, the situation is twice as worse for such a person, as they may, due to their indifference, hesitate to look for a new job, preferring to justify themselves and feel miserable, thus only aggravating their psychological problems.\n\nAnother negative aspect of being lazy is connected to physical health. It is not a secret that lethargic people are physically less active than those who prefer to throw themselves into the span of life; logically, idle people spend more time without movement. According to a recent study by Tel Aviv University, being inactive causes one’s fat cells (those which already exist in the body) to become larger; in other words, an inactive lifestyle not only contributes into an individual gaining extra weight, but also makes the situation with their already existing fat cells worse (Fitday). Moreover, the bad news is that the negative effects of leisure time spent in a nonconstructive way cannot be negated by physical exercises—in other words, the damage dealt to one’s body by hours spent in laziness is irreversible. In its turn, extra fat can result into obesity with all its intrinsic health issues.\n\nLaziness can affect the entire life of an individual. Because they are unwilling to make an active effort in regard to the important spheres of life, lethargic people miss numerous opportunities that life offers them every day. Though a person may think they are too tired to step out of their comfort zone, they comfort themselves by promising to do it later, or justifying themselves in any other way—in fact, all these thoughts and obstacles are an illusion. During the thousands of years of evolution human bodies and minds have become pinpointed for active performance; human beings need new experiences, physical activity, emotional charges, and discharging to function properly and to feel well. By being lethargic, a person denies themselves of this, and excludes themselves from the course of life, which leads to mental stagnation and intellectual degradation.\n\nLaziness can be called one of the scourges of the modern world. Though often seen simply as a forgivable weakness, it can have a number of negative effects on a person. In terms of these consequences, it should be mentioned that laziness often leads to the worsening of one’s relationships at work and decreased work performance, which can result into job loss, excessive stress, and psychic disturbance. Also, laziness and the stated inactive lifestyle leads to irreversible health damage. Ultimately, laziness results in mental stagnation and intellectual degradation.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the main causes of mental retardation in children?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Giving birth to a child is, perhaps, the most significant event in the life of almost any woman. Though today women often prefer to follow a career rather than give birth to children, the majority of young mothers state it is a life-changing experience. Without a doubt, a beautiful, healthy child is the most valued and loved living thing for every mother. But, unfortunately, a certain percentage of children are born with different deviations, both physical and mental. In relation to this, a question arises: what causes mentally-challenged children to be born?\n\nThe first and foremost factor that causes mental retardation and other deviations is an excessive use of alcohol by a young mother in the prenatal period—particularly, during the first trimester (12 weeks) of pregnancy. According to statistics, at least one of out of 600 children only in the United States is exposed to fetal alcohol syndrome (Encyclopedia of Children’s Health). Researches show that even moderate intakes of alcohol can affect the mental capabilities of pre-natal children. In addition, smoking tobacco (or other substances) and taking illegal drugs can also cause mental retardation.\n\nGenetics is the second most influential cause of mental retardation among children that should be taken in consideration. Inherited causes of mental retardation are numerous; for example, chances of giving birth to a mentally-challenged child increase if one or both parents were mentally retarded. Sometimes, decreased mental capabilities are caused not by genetic defects or omissions, but rather by abnormalities in chromosomes—structures inside cells’ nucleus that contain genes. Down syndrome is one of such diseases (Human Illnesses).\n\nThe factors that are difficult to avoid is ecology and environment. It is not a secret that we live in an age of poor ecology. Industrial and traffic emissions, radiation, stressful factors that affect future mothers—and thus their children—all this increases the chances of giving birth to a child with mental retardation. Besides, in disadvantaged regions, mental handicaps can be caused additionally by malnutrition, disease-producing conditions, and inadequate medical care—both for mothers and children (The Prevention News).###"}
{"prompt": "What are the main factors that contribute to poverty around the world?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " After the global economic crisis of 2008, many people around the globe faced one of the worst social phenomenons: poverty. In the United States alone, the number of poor people in 2012 increased up to 46.5 million (Reuters). In developing countries, the situation had become even worse. Poverty does not mean that a person has little money to afford goods they want to purchase, or to maintain a stable quality of life; rather often poverty is absolute, which means that one literally has no livelihood. But what factors usually stand behind such dramatic impacts of poverty around the world, except the aforementioned economic crisis?\n\nPoverty rates are greatly influenced by overpopulation. Overpopulation is a situation of a large number of people residing in a territory that is extremely limited in space and resources. Developing countries often face the problem of overpopulation; except the unequal distribution of resources and the lack of space, they usually have high birth rates, and low agricultural productivity. For example, Bangladesh has the highest population density in the world—2,970 persons per square mile. The dominating majority of them are engaged in low-productivity farming and manual labor, which causes extremely high levels of poverty in this country (Poverty at Large).\n\nAnother factor standing behind the increased poverty rates increase is unemployment. This problem has become one of the most urgent after 2008. In 2009 through 2010, about 42% of all families in Great Britain alone had no working members (Children Poverty Action Group). The job markets cannot offer enough jobs that would correspond with the skills of unemployed people. Besides, because of poverty, many people are willing to get any job for any payment; thus, they decrease the overall wages in those spheres that they start working at. In other words, the cheapening of labor and the working force takes place. There is no need to tell that low-wage jobs and part-time jobs are nothing else but poverty traps.\n\nOne more reason is significant demographic shifts. For example, in the United States a number of single-member families is traditionally high, and has been increasing; because one parent has less opportunities to ensure an adequate standard of living both for their children and for themselves, single-parent families are traditionally poorer then normal. Besides, poor people often share a belief that it is the social institutions to blame for their poverty, or that they can never make it out of their low income; therefore, they create psychological backgrounds for their financial condition.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the effects of positive thinking?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " More than 60 years have passed since the time when American priest and theologian Norman Peale had offered his famous theory of positive thinking. Though it was heavily criticized by the psychiatric community, Peale’s book describing this theory has become extremely popular all around the world, and has been reported to cause intense positive changes in the lives of those who read it. Since then, many philosophers and writers approached the topic of positive thinking; the reason of their theories’ popularity is that they often offer a real alternative to the common and regular way of thinking. As thinking changes, an individual’s behavior and habits change as well, affecting their lifestyle. Below are listed several effects that can be caused by a change in one’s thinking paradigm.\n\nThough many people think that positive thinking is mostly about keeping one’s head in the sand and ignoring daily problems, trying to look optimistic, in reality it has more to do with the way an individual talks to themselves. Self-talk is a constant stream of thoughts, often unconscious and negative about certain events, phenomena, people, or even the person themselves. Negative self-talk undermines self-confidence and decreases self-esteem. On the other hand, positive thinking can help to stop negative self-talks and start to consciously form a positive view on an issue. People who regularly practice positive thinking tend to solve problems more effectively, they are less exposed to stress caused by outer factors, and believe in themselves and in what they do.\n\nPositive thinking has several beneficial effects on the body and its condition of health. People who think positively demonstrate increased life spans, lower rates of depression and distress, better physical and psychological well-being, reduced risks of death from cardiovascular diseases, and other attributes (Mayo Clinic).\n\nPositive thinking also contributes to our ability to cope with problems and hardships, and to remain sane and confident in difficult situations. For example, researchers have found that in the case of a crisis accompanied by strong emotions, such as a terroristic attack or a natural disaster, positive thinking can provide a sort of buffer against depression and distress (About.com). Resilient people who think positively tend to treat every problem as a challenge, a chance for improvement of any kind, or as an opportunity for personal growth. On the other hand, pessimists tend to perceive problems as a source of additional stress, and often feel discouraged way before trying to solve the problem, even if the issue is insignificant.\n\nPositive thinking is a powerful tool for coping with hardships and improving the quality of one’s life. It has nothing to do with ignorant optimism, when an individual refuses to notice a problem; positive thinking is a kind of self-talk. Thinking in a positive, self-encouraging way has numerous effects on human psychological and physical health. It also makes people who practice it less prone to stress, and allows them to cope with problems more effectively, and without severe emotional discomfort.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the psychological effects of divorce on children?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Marriage by mutual consent is without a doubt one of the most important and happy events in the life of an individual. When two people meet and once they decide to create a family, it may seem they will stay together forever. However, the reality brings in its own adjustments, and about 50% of marriages end up with a divorce in the USA (Trust). Though divorce is often a psychologically difficult process, adults can deal with the consequences. The situation changes to worse if the couple gave birth to a child, who is often the one to suffer the most from divorce.\n\nDivorce causes different emotional reactions in children of different ages. Preschoolers, who are often unable to understand the reasons behind their parents’ divorce, tend to blame themselves and feel responsible for bringing their parents back together again (Clinical Psychology Associates). Children of 6-8 years continue to have similar fantasies, though the feeling of guilt and responsibility for the divorce decreases; they, however, experience a strong sense of grief and loss. Children of 9-12 years are able to understand the reasons of their parents’ divorce better, and tend to consciously express their anger and disapproval, and take the side of one of the parents. As it can be seen, divorce causes intense emotional distress in children, and can make them feel guilty and responsible for bringing their parents back together.\n\nChildren and teenagers whose parents are divorced are more likely to drop out of schools and are more prone to committing crimes. Research held by the law firm Mishcon de Reya in 2009 revealed people who had experienced the divorce of their parents in the preceding 20 years showed increased aggression (42%), were forced to comfort upset parent (49%), or had to lie to one of them (24%). 1 of 10 turned to crime, and about 8% considered committing suicide. Besides, only 60% of children by the age of 20 had graduated from high school, compared to 78% of children in two-parent households (The Week).\n\nResearch held in 2005 showed children of divorced parents are more likely to divorce themselves when they become adults. If both of the partners experienced a divorce of their parents in the past, the chances for them to break the relationship are three-to-one (The Week). This also corresponds to Eric Berne’s conception of life scenarios, according to which children tend to repeat their parents’ lives to a certain extent.\n\nAs it can be seen, the divorce of parents can have severe psychological effects on children. They become exposed to significant emotional distress, based on the feeling of guilt and responsibility for the break. Children from divorced families consider committing suicides more often, are more prone for crime, and have less chances to graduate from school. In addition, the risk children from divorced families will divorce themselves as adults is much higher. Thus, children are the ones who suffer the most from divorces, because they cannot cope properly with their grief and can have difficulties with socialization and marriage in adult life.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the positive effects of music on the human brain and human health?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Music is a form of art which has accompanied humankind since the origins of our species. Starting from the early primitive instruments used by our cave-dwelling ancestors, and ending up with modern synthesizers and computer programs that create new musical sounds, human beings have constantly tried to surround themselves with music. It gradually became more complex, as well as the instruments on which it was performed. Research has shown that music can positively impact plants and animals, and scientists discovered that it can also provide beneficial effects to human health; today, music therapy is a popular and effective way of treating psychological disorders. So, what are the positive effects of music on the human brain and human health?\n\nMusic can decrease the risks of heart attack and stroke. Music has been found to lower blood pressure; changes in the “autonomic” nervous system, such as breathing and heart rate can also be altered by music (Tryon Daily Bulletin). This helps to create a so-called “relaxation response,” which counteracts the damaging effects of chronic stress. Music contributes to the release of endorphins, which are protein molecules produced by the nervous system that works with sedative receptors in the brain. They improve mood, boost the immune system, reduce eating disorder symptoms, and help fight cancer. In this respect, music has powerful positive effects on the functioning of the human body.\n\nMusic also affects the way our brain functions. It is reported that easy-listening and classical music improves the duration and intensity of concentration in all age groups and ability levels (eMed Expert). At the same time, another research study has shown that music with a strong beat stimulates brain waves to resonate with them. In other words, the faster the beat is, the sharper concentration becomes, and thinking becomes more alert (Tryon Daily Bulletin). Listening to music also helps people recall information; certain types of music can serve as strong “keys,” supposedly forming a strong connection between emotions they evoke and the information, which can be recalled much easier during playing back the song which was being played during the process of learning (eMed Expert).###"}
{"prompt": "What is the root of all social evils?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Thinkers of many cultures and epochs have sought to find the fundamental reasons for social problems. Philosophers of the past analyzed numerous contributing factors, such as leaders, money, religion, and so on. A significant number of these thinkers came to the conclusion that an individuals’ passionate attitude towards money was an influential trigger of various social calamities. Desiring to obtain more and more material goods and profit causes an individual to become selfish and hard-hearted—this in turn affects the quality of a whole community. An uncontrolled love of money is the reason for many disturbances and wrongs which are enacted.\n\nApostle Paul, in his letter to Timothy, today known as Timothy I, says, “…they that desire to be rich, fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful desires, which plunge men into destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evils; which some coveting, have erred from the faith.” Paul emphasizes the pursuit of money and financial gain causes one to be distanced from one’s morality and virtue. No longer do people seek to build a relationship with their neighbor; instead, they seek for ways to use them to obtain more wealth and security. At the same time, people who treat others as a means of reaching their goals tend to be treated in the same manner, thus multiplying their own misfortunes.\n\nPeople with a strong lust for money can develop an insensible disposition. In the discipline of psychology, there exists a correlation between happy feelings and money which has already been discovered (Vohs, Mead & Goode, 2008). Those who have a strong love of money constantly feel the urge to gain more money as if they have a lack of it; consequently, these individuals have a poor disposition and are impatient when confronted with those whom they believe are seeking to prevent them from gaining money.\n\nBecause of a fanatic identification with their savings, those with a persistent love of money are hesitant to lose their capital. Such individuals are hesitant in investing in community projects or remaining loyal to their fellow coworkers, employees, and even neighbors. Today, because of the apparent focus on obtaining more entertainment devices, cars, games, and technology in general, the sense of community is dying. Paul Mattick states in his book Art in Its Time that, “A steady increase of the love of money present in our capitalistic economy system causes a sense of community to decline as faith is placed in material things for the self rather than concepts for the community” (Mattick, 2003).\n\nIn an attempt to understand the true nature of different social problems of the past and of today, many thinkers have paid attention to the phenomenon of yearning for money. Because of an individual’s love of money, there is a decline in personal values and morals. Subsequently, the constant pursuit of money causes one’s behavior to be well under par with the needs of other human beings. In addition, many people with an excessive passion for gaining money tend to identify themselves with their financial well-being, thus being afraid to lose their capital. In their fear, they lose the greatest of all values: a sense of peace.###"}
{"prompt": "How did World War II change the United States of America?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When talking about the pre-war and post-war United States of America, one needs to understand that the nation’s mentality had experienced a significant shift from one set of values to another. Some of these new ways of thinking were drastically different from those that were previously shared by Americans for centuries. The changes happened not only on an individual level, but also on a national level. It can be claimed that World War II marked a paradigm shift in the American way of thinking. A paradigm can be defined as a model, a pattern of perception, or thinking, which is dominant in a society during a certain period of time. Therefore, a paradigm shift is a move from old models of thinking and explaining the surrounding reality as a new one. It can be achieved through various ways: revolution, metamorphosis, slow and gradual transformation, enlightenment, and so on.\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, the USA, still reeling from the effects of the Great Depression, experienced serious shifts in its cultural paradigm. The country stood isolated, claiming a policy of Laissez Faire, which freed America from any responsibility from the world’s conflicts. The USA’s focus was understandably inward; logic dictated that the country should take care of its own first; however, on December 7, 1941, the day Japanese forces bombed Pearl Harbor, the Laissez Faire foreign policy ended abruptly. World War II, together with a complex of other factors created an internationally-responsible America, with the society sharing a dominant ideology of consumerism, while embracing the role of women in the workplace and military.\n\nWorld War II stimulated a stale economy in America, and as the end of the war neared, many Americans feared another detrimental downturn in the financial state of the country. Instead, Americans discovered that “pent-up consumer demand fueled exceptionally strong economic growth in the post war period” (U.S. Department of State). Consumerism thrived and with it the country. Factories that had been centered on the manufacturing of war equipment suddenly returned to the production of automobiles. A housing market boomed, and the country’s gross national product doubled in one decade. The economic state of America boomed in the post-war era, and a country that recently stood on the precipice of economic failure soon became the financial powerhouse of the world.\n\nThese factories also facilitated another paradigm shift in the American mentality. Prior to America’s entrance into the World War II theater, women were often associated with all kinds of domestic work, raising children, and cooking, but with the surge of men sent overseas into battle, women were asked to fill the vacancies left behind. They were called upon to work in the factories and do the jobs once reserved for men. “By 1945, nearly one out of every four married women worked outside the home” (American Women in World War II, 2012). This paradigm shift continues today in American culture.\n\nPrior to America’s entrance into World War II, the country was inwardly focused and its workforce consisted mainly of men. The War united the country and changed its foreign policy priorities, stimulated its economy, and opened a plethora of opportunities for women in the marketplace. Since that time, America has refused to look backwards.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the negative effects of noise pollution?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Industry growth, an increasing number of vehicles and constant information overload causes a significant and underestimated problem: noise pollution. The term noise pollution is used to define unwanted sounds that are released into the environment. Various research studies have proven that noise pollution imposes a number of negative impacts on mental and physical health. To understand the reasons behind these health conditions, people should consider the effects that are usually caused by noise pollution.\n\nIn a modern megalopolis, noise pollution arises from many sources, such as traffic, barking dogs, noisy neighbors, aircraft, verbal advertising in streets, and many other environmental factors merging into one sound wall. A person may get used to perceiving these sounds and ignore them, but on a subconscious level, such constant noise exposure has a significant effect. Noise pollution is measured in decibels, and its intensity and duration determines the impact on an individual’s health.\n\nOne of the most obvious negative consequences of prolonged exposure to noise is hearing loss. Studies show that people who have been regularly exposed to intense noise, due to the nature of their work, have decreased hearing sensibility compared to those who have worked in more quiet conditions. The most disturbing source of noise pollution stems from traffic (Healthy Hearing). Elevated sound levels cause changes in the structure of the inner ear, which results in irreversible hearing loss.\n\nAnother negative effect caused by noise pollution is heightened irritability and sensitivity. Different sounds can have different impacts on a person; thus, one can get annoyed with the sound of water dripping from a faucet or car horns blowing, but relax to the sounds of falling rain. Natural sounds are much less irritating than artificial sounds, such as traffic noise. However, natural sounds also create a sound wall effect as in the case of a waterfall or the wind blowing. In contrast, living near the motorway can lead to frustration and can seriously upset human nerves.\n\nSpeech and sleep interference is another issue that arises from noise pollution. It can be difficult to talk while standing on a busy street, and in this case, people often have to shout to be heard. Therefore, hearing and interpreting each other becomes an issue. The noise of a big city is one of the most popular reasons for sleep disorders. High levels of noise often wake people in the middle of the night and hinder them while trying to fall asleep again, thus breaking bio-rhythms and causing weakness and drowsiness during the next day.\n\nDecreased work performance should also be mentioned in the list of negative impacts caused by noise pollution. High levels of noise can cause inaccuracy and inattentiveness, which can result in decreased productivity and additional stress. This is a crucial point for people whose workplaces are potentially dangerous, such as construction sites or factories. A misheard order or instruction, or the lack of concentration in such workplaces can lead to severe consequences.\n\nIt can be observed that noise pollution is a serious, though underestimated problem for the human population. It causes a number of negative effects both on health and the effectiveness of performing actions. Among the most obvious and significant negative effects are hearing loss, increased irritability, speech and sleep disturbances, and decreased work performance. Even if a person becomes accustomed to constant noise and thinks that it does not affect them, changes still occur. Every individual, including scientific and healthcare organizations, should seek ways to minimize the aforementioned impacts and reduce their exposure to noise pollution.###"}
{"prompt": "How does the overuse of technology impact children's development?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Digital-age children, even down to the very youngest, divide their time between three major innovations: television, computers, and video games, but is there harm in children spending increasing amounts of time engaging in media-related activities? There are no easy answers in this highly-technological 21st century; parents need to consider all digital media in order to determine what is best for their child. Well-known journalist Marie Winn (2002) states, “Today sensible parents tend to lump the various electronic technologies into one category. They talk about ‘screen activities’ and ‘screen time’” (p. 196). Dr. Larry Rosen, as quoted by associate editor of Mashable magazine Stephanie Buck (2011) “There is a very real possibility of overdoing it . . . Technology must be chosen correctly” (p. 1).\n\nMany inventions have changed and shaped modern society; however, the impact of these advances has been primarily on adults. In contrast, the technological development that has had the most profound effect on children was the introduction of television (Winn, 2002, p. 283). From the earliest years, parents have worried about what television viewing might be doing to their children’s development. Young children learn by playing; first they imitate what they observe, and then they evolve into purposeful pretending in which they create a world they can control and manipulate. As children age, they move from parallel play to actual interaction with others. They learn by doing. Television, however, is a passive activity. Instead of creating and manipulating, the child assumes a more passive role that often takes the place of play. Instead of actively manipulating their environment and actively acquiring language, the children simply watch. Interestingly, Bittman et al. (2011) conclude it is not so much the time spent watching television that influences children’s acquisition of language from birth to age four, as much as the amount of parental involvement and interaction (p. 171). Other studies have indicated that this early TV viewing does have a negative impact on language acquisition and vocabulary development that can even carry over into later school years (Winn, 2002, p. 285).\n\nIf parents are concerned that children are being heavily influenced by television, sometimes it seems to be a concern that they do not have enough exposure to computers. Spurred by what Winn (2002) calls “canny marketing” (p. 190) parents are buying software designed for younger and younger children. “Manufacturers’ advertisements preyed on parental anxieties about their kids’ development… and their desires to give their offspring an educational jumpstart” (Winn, 2002, p. 190). Parents feel compelled to expose younger and younger children to developmental software in an effort to ensure they will not be left behind academically or socially. Buck (2011) however cites a study that links the overuse of technology to a change in brain development (p. 2). “Human connection, eye contact and dialogue are paramount. Devices are hugely limiting this important exposure” leading to an increase in mental illnesses and a change in even the formation of the brain, particularly the frontal lobe” (Buck, 2011, p. 2). Quite the opposite was reported by Bittman et al. (2011), who found that the effect of the “use of computers in infancy appears to be negligible . . . computer access (but not computer games) at later ages was associated with increased traditional literacy” (p. 172).\n\nInterestingly, Winn (2002) feels that while it is not the same as interacting with peers, video games do allow children to be less passive. “Kids get to do something, and something happens as a result” (p. 194). This is offset, however, by the development of an expectation of instant gratification. Children who are used to video interaction “may not be willing to make the long, arduous efforts necessary to play an instrument well or excel at a sport” (Winn, 2002, p. 195). There also appears to be an addictive element as well. Winn (2002) cites a study done at Hammersmith Hospital in London that found that playing video games doubles the brain’s production of dopamine, equivalent to the amount that can come from an injection of a powerful stimulant (p. 195).###"}
{"prompt": "What were some of the consequences of World War II?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " World War II can be rightly called one of the most significant events in the history of humanity. It had a significant impact on the development of the entire world, and resulted in the revision of many socio-political doctrines, policies, and principles of international relations.\n\nWorld War II had many consequences. The USSR lost over 24 million people, both military and civilians, and over 21 million people were left homeless and in poor conditions (Fussell 745). Great Britain and France had both collapsed as empires, and European boundaries had been literally redrawn. The United States of America claimed to lead the reconstruction efforts and started to conduct policy, directed to establishing itself as a new superpower. Thus, modern geopolitical balance of power in the world can also be considered as one of the direct consequences of World War II. Among many others, several consequences of this war are felt even today, such as the increase in baby boomers in the U.S., which has a continued effect on the economy; cold wars and war sensitivity, including the nuclear arms race today; and the establishment of the U.S. as a leading power in the world.\n\nBetween the years 1946 and 1964, a sudden and large increase in birthrate was detected in the U.S. The reason for such a dramatic growth in population is still a disputed subject among experts. At first, the U.S. welcomed this phenomenon by passing GI bills to improve education, skills and income. Now, the generation of baby boomers is already retiring, or fast approaching retirement age. Currently, the cost of Social Security is rising faster than the taxed income of the working population (Lavery 56). Due to this fact, nowadays, it has become questionable whether the American economy will be able to afford the future cost of Social Security, as the baby boomer generation continues to retire.\n\nAnother consequence of World War II is the continuing Cold War. One might say that it had ended several decades ago, but actually, it still goes on, though now it is not so intense (Lavery 76). Nation states spend billions of dollars to increase military power. Nuclear weapons today have become the weapons of choice. Diplomacy, combined with a demonstration of military power, is often used to pressure leaders who conduct policies which are different from those which the world’s superpowers consider desirable. Wars continue to influence domestic policies and define the full meaning of conflicts.\n\nWorld War II hit the U.S. economy—the expenditure on military action approximated over 95 million dollars. After it ended, the United States established itself as a superpower and assumed the leading role in post-war reconstruction (Lavery 86). Today, the United States continues to play the role of global benefactor, whether or not their help is required, interfering in domestic policies of a number of states and nations. This results in many government leaders resenting U.S. policy and its superpower status.\n\nAfter World War II, international conflicts have been perceived differently. A century ago, a war was mostly a local event, concerning only its direct participants (Fussell 87). Now, a war is a process which involves multiple sides, and has consequences which are often difficult to predict. Nuclear arms seem to be the weapon of choice, and nations often feel empowered by displaying their arms for the entire world to see. To promote peace and understanding among nations, a special organization, the United Nations, was established.\n\nThe world continues to feel the consequential tremors of World War II through financial and economic woes. Among the most obvious consequences of this war, one can point out an effect of the baby boomers generation on the economy of the U.S., cold wars, nuclear weapon races, and the establishment of the U.S. as a leading power in the world.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the three major issues associated with alcohol advertising?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Various facets of a society, be it the youth, mature adults, or even children are constantly exposed to complex and often conflicting messages about alcohol usage (Gorg 546). Alcohol advertising indirectly causes many societal problems that need to be dealt with. However, one can identify three major issues that need to be addressed, namely the over-consumption of alcohol, underage drinking, and the perception of a negative body image.\n\nSome experts link excessive alcohol consumption with an increased exposure of the population to advertisements for alcohol. Alcohol advertisements broadcasted on television—especially on sports channels—have been identified as being the most effective. They make the largest contribution to the rate of growth of alcohol consumption compared to any other type of publicity, such as magazine and billboard advertisements (Longman 56). Over-consumption of strong spirits, such as whiskey, vodka, and gin can readily lead to a crippling dependence on alcohol, debilitating illnesses, and even premature death. Further social consequences that need to be factored in include divorce, domestic violence, and bankruptcy.\n\nAnother issue unequivocally associated with alcohol advertising is the relentless rise in underage drinking. In the USA, as well as in many other countries, a person is only legally permitted to consume strong alcoholic drinks when they are 21 years old. However, according to scientific research, many young people begin to consume alcohol at a much younger age (Reese 456). This phenomenon, encouraged by judicious advertising, is supported, for example, by a specific college culture that promotes binge drinking and wild parties (Reese 454). In some countries of Eastern Europe, it has been reported that young people use or even abuse alcohol well before they enter college.\n\nThe stereotypical and racy sexual imagery projected by advertisements that actively promote alcohol consumption raise significant moral and ethical issues. One of the primary target audiences of alcohol advertisements is the single, young man. Advertisements aimed at this category often include “controversial content” such as scantily-clad women (Gorg 195). Not only young men, but also young women watch these advertisements. Women tend to compare themselves to the models featured in the commercials. The impossibly perfect, photoshopped models in advertisements often lead “a normal young woman” to perceive her own body image to be somehow inadequate (Gorg 237). In the real world, this is simply not the case; there are all sorts of shapes and bodily sizes of attractive women. Sadly, a psychological disease termed dysmorphophobia, a dysmorphic syndrome or a body dysmorphic disorder has been classified. It is characterized by a hostility towards one’s own body and by the owner perceiving their body to be defective in some way or even ugly.\n\nCompanies that produce alcohol, as well as advertising agencies, are generally more concerned with promoting a certain brand than with the ethical consequences of their actions (Longman 24). Besides, alcohol companies argue that they have a right to advertise in the most effective way possible in order to generate sales (Reese 353). However, negative effects of alcohol advertising are worth considering, as they cause social and personal problems, such as alcohol over-consumption, underage drinking, and negative body image.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the main reasons for job rejection?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Starting a new job is almost always stressful, and the rejection of a job candidate is a rather common occurrence. It may seem strange, but many hiring staff prefer to explain the reasons for their rejection in vague terms, so a person almost never knows where they have made a mistake and where their main flaw was. Each time a job interview occurs, one has to guess what to pay attention to and what to be prepared for.\n\nWhat are the main reasons of refusal? Inadequate salary expectations may be considered one of the first and foremost causes (Porter 54). If an employer evaluates one’s salary demands as excessive, he will probably reject their application and search for someone whose requirements will be more modest. On the other hand, lowered salary demands may mean the candidate lacks qualification or self-esteem.\n\nAnother reason why the candidacy of an individual can be rejected is unreliable information in a resume (Sort 56). For example, if a person specifies their proficiency in foreign languages as “fluent” but demonstrates much weaker knowledge during the interview, it is obvious that they will have little chance of being hired. As they say, there is no secret that will not be revealed.\n\nLack of motivation is also among the main reasons of refusal (Porter 347). Candidates who have no idea about their own career plans and ambitions probably will not be of a great interest for any company. One should formulate their motivation for working in this particular company, as well as in general, to give an impression of a self-confident and purposeful person.\n\nIt may seem funny or strange, but sometimes high-qualification may be the cause of rejection too. Employers fear that employees whose qualifications are excessive for the position they are applying to will lose interest in the job quickly and start to search for another one (Porter 237). Sometimes a high-qualified person cannot find a position for a long period of time, thus agreeing to work in a position that they had outgrown a long time ago. One sees their new position as temporary, and looks for the job that will suit their abilities.\n\nIt would also be useful to make preparations for the interview itself, as potential employers will most likely evaluate candidates’ appearance, manner of speech, and behavior. A lack of preparation for the interview may be a serious flaw. One should pay attention to the questions about their previous jobs, and try not to make harsh statements about the company they were working at, about ex-colleagues or bosses, even if they have insulted them (Sort 176). The company needs to find a solid professional who would be easy to work with, and not a cranky misanthrope, even if he possesses high qualification. A candidate should try to be pleasant.\n\nThere are many reasons for rejection. Still, inadequate salary expectations, the lack of motivation, and unreliable information, presented in the resume are among the main blunders one may commit while job-hunting. Besides, one may be rejected due to excessive qualification or because of the lack of preparation for the interview. Thus, it would be useful to take these reasons into consideration when job-hunting.###"}
{"prompt": "What are the possible consequences of global warming?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " During the last century, more inventions were made than during the whole of history (Collins 64). Humanity flew into space, tamed atomic energy, found a way to cure many diseases that were considered incurable, and almost every day is marked by a new breakthrough. However, there is a downside. For a long period of time, people did not think about the consequences of their exponential development. Vast tracts of forests were cleared for agricultural purposes, thousands of tons of carbon dioxide dissolved in the ozone, hundreds of species of animals and plants became extinct each year. The rapid development of humanity renders a bad influence on Earth. One of these influences is climate change.\n\nIt is not a secret that a couple of hundreds of years ago, the climate on Earth was colder than now. Many scientists warn about global warming—a process of a constant increase of the annual temperature across the whole planet. For the first time, its surge was recorded in the last quarter of the 20th century, and since that time, the average temperature had increased by 0.7° (Freanz 237). The further one goes from the equator, the more obvious climate changes become.\n\nWhat are the possible consequences of global warming? According to the recent reports from the United Nations, during the 21st century, the average temperature will rise more than 1, 4-1, 8° and will cause Arctic glaciers to melt faster (Ramus 24). The sea level will increase by 10 cm. It does not seem to possess any danger, but in reality, it will become a serious threat for those countries that are located not too high above sea level. Some specialists predict that until the end of the current century, the ocean will rise a meter on the whole. The Netherlands, Great Britain, Japan, as well as the islands of Oceania and the Caribbean basin will be at risk. 30-40% of species and ecosystems will become extinct, as their habitat will change much faster than they adapt. If the temperature increases by one degree Celsius, dramatic modifications to forests’ composition will occur. Some species have already begun to react to climate changes. For example, migratory birds start to fly away later in autumn and to come back much earlier in spring.\n\nGlobal warming will negatively affect precipitation. In arid regions, such as Central Asia, Australia, and the Mediterranean, South Africa, and so on the situation will become even more complicated due to the reduction of precipitation (Reese 45). At the same time, some regions may suffer from abnormal cyclones and the heavy rains that have become much more frequent. The recent hurricane in North America may be a demonstration of these processes. Such changes will have an adverse effect on agriculture. Due to warming, it may improve in Northern Europe, but in Southern Europe, Africa, and many regions of Asia, high temperatures, droughts, floods, and soil erosion will cause irreparable damage.\n\nSpecialists predict that yields in Africa and Asia will decrease, and Australia and New Zealand will face a great lack of drinking water (Opus 235). A risk of floods in Europe will increase, and the eastern coast of the United States will undergo increased numbers of hurricanes and soil erosion. In addition, global warming will also create a favorable environment for diseases, so a dramatic growth of epidemics and pandemics can be expected (Lank 87).\n\nScientists have discovered that Earth is warming much faster than it did before, and there is convincing evidence that it is humanity who is responsible for that. At the moment, research that aims to find solutions for this problem is being conducted. Every country should take action to prevent causing more damage to our planet, as the consequences will be serious for every citizen of Earth.###"}
